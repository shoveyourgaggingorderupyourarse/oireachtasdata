We know businesses across the country continue to feel the impact Covid-19 has had on their normal operations.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the Government introduced a Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), with the aim to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government's other existing schemes such as CRSS and is designed to help with fixed costs. While modest, it will go a ways to help small businesses meet their fixed costs.</p>  <p>  The total number of Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) applications received for County Longford is 99.  Of that figure to date, 29 applications have been paid, 2 have been approved and are due to be paid, 2 have been received and are awaiting a decision and 36 have been refused. </p>  <p>  In relation to County Westmeath 104 applications have been received for the SBASC grant.  Of that figure to date, 57 applications have been paid, 3 applications have been approved and are due to be paid and 44 applications have been refused.</p>  <p>  Refusals have occurred due to eligibility requirements, such as businesses not meeting the turnover criteria, incomplete application form, the business was in receipt of CRSS or they were not in a rateable premises.</p>  <p>  Last month, we announced an expanded SBASC phase 2 scheme, which will be open for applications in early June with a closing date of 21st July.  Phase 2 has been expanded to include businesses working from a non rateable premises and those whose turnover is below &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  Businesses who are working from non rateable premises and meet all other eligibility criteria will receive a &euro;4,000 grant and businesses whose turnover is below &euro;50,000 and meet all other eligibility criteria will receive &euro;1,000 grant.  These businesses have been ineligible for schemes in the past and it is my intention to ensure that these businesses receive some state support during these difficult time.  The purpose of these grants are to help meet fixed costs associated with running a business.</p>  <p>Further details of this expanded SBASC scheme will be available shortly on my Department's website and on Local Authority websites, who will administer the scheme.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-03a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021060300074#WRA00800"><p>The Government has approved measures, based on public health advice, allowing for the planned reopening of the hospitality sector, this summer. As the roll out of the vaccination programme progresses over the coming months, restrictions can be relaxed which will enable the hospitality sector to open up on a phased and safe basis, to avoid losing the progress society has made over the last 6 months.</p><p>From 2nd June, hotels can reopen for overnight guests and provide indoor restaurant service, followed by outdoor service at restaurants and pubs from 7th June. On 5th July, bars and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors again. </p><p>This approach is in line with NPHET advice. We have never closed hotels' dining rooms. During level 5, when we were all locked down at home, hotels remained open for essential reasons, such as for people who had to stay there because they had nowhere else to stay, and we never closed their restaurants or dining rooms. </p><p>The Government is conscious of the challenges faced by the hospitality sector and, in particular, for pubs and bars that do not serve food. This phased reopening supports a safe and gradual approach, for employers, employees, and customers, underpinned by the guidance in the Work Safety Protocol and the sectoral Guidance developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p><p>Our pubs and bars are an important economic driver, social outlet and a popular element of our tourism and hospitality offering. My colleague, Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin TD, has announced new outdoor service supports for the hospitality industry. The Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme provides assistance to transform appropriate outdoor spaces as welcoming vibrant places, helping businesses to recover and people to return to work. To help the sector reopen successfully, for businesses reopening in June and coming off the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), there will be a payment on reopening, as a double payment for three weeks. </p><p>In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed a suite of comprehensive sectoral guidances for the re-opening of hospitality and tourism businesses, these are available on their website.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-03a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021060300074#WRA01100"><p>Chapter 24 of CETA dealing with &ldquo;Trade and the Environment&rdquo; commits both the EU and Canada to ensure that their laws and policies provide and encourage high levels of environmental protections.  It further commits both Parties to strive to continue to improve such laws and policies.  These environmental provisions are enforceable through the Agreement, including review by an independent panel of experts and a high degree of transparency and monitoring.  CETA also includes a commitment on the part of all governments to ensure that there is no relaxation of environmental law in efforts to promote trade or attract investment.</p>  <p>  CETA also includes commitments towards the sustainable management of forests, fisheries and aquaculture.  It reinforces the Parties' commitments to multilateral environmental agreements to which it is a party, including the Paris Agreement, which is an important shared responsibility for the European Union and its Member States, as well as Canada.</p>  <p>  Importantly, in CETA both sides also agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  On the contrary, the EU and Canada are committed to ensuring that CETA helps ensure that economic growth, social development, and environmental protection go hand in hand.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, including the environment, so Ireland&rsquo;s right to regulate in sensitive areas in a non-discriminatory, WTO-compliant way is protected.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Investor Court System &ndash; or ICS &ndash; within CETA, the full terms of the Agreement ensure the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;right to regulate&rdquo;, and they are specifically directed at so-called &ldquo;regulatory chill&rdquo; while also ensuring that investors can raise legitimate claims under CETA&rsquo;s Investor Court System.  </p>  <p>  Historically, most investment claims do not challenge a government&rsquo;s ability to legislate or regulate, rather they are administrative in character, challenging discriminatory treatment of an individual investor in the context of a particular license, permit, or in cases of expropriation.  </p>  <p>  CETA does not restrict either the EU or Canada from passing new laws in areas of public interest such as the environment, and health and safety, among others.  Nor does CETA affect the Government&rsquo;s scope for developing new laws in response to the needs and priorities of Irish citizens.  Therefore, I see no need for the risk assessment suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Each Plan is overseen by a Regional Steering Committee chaired by a senior level businessperson. Along with Minister Robert Troy I will drive the delivery of the new Plans nationally. The new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 are expected to be completed in Quarter 3 this year. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided funding to assist enterprise development and regional jobs growth. For example, my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund and Border Fund has allocated over &euro;117 million across 79 enterprise strengthening projects in every region over a series of competitive calls since 2017, through Enterprise Ireland. These Funds enable significant collaborative and innovative regional projects to provide a timely impetus to job creation in regional locations.  </p>  <p>  Almost two thirds of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2020 were in regions outside of Dublin. During 2020 IDA Ireland created 10,082 new jobs outside of Dublin. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy 2021-2024 targets half of FDI investments overall, as going to regions outside of Dublin. The Local Enterprise Offices continue to provide a first stop shop to individuals who want to start or grow their micro enterprise in every county. Currently there are 35,236 people employed in over 7,500 LEO client companies nationally. The Deputy would be aware of recent moves by Chanelle Pharma to take over the Aptar facility in Ballinasloe, highlighting the attractiveness of our regional towns for job creation.</p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to the development of a &lsquo;Town Centre First&rsquo; policy focused on regeneration of rural towns and villages.  My Department&rsquo;s Retail Forum also developed a Framework for Town Centre Renewal which is a useful tool to assist Town Teams in how to improve footfall and customer experience in their towns. Through the Government&rsquo;s National Planning Framework, the main cities are to develop as viable alternatives to Dublin with funding channeled through Project Ireland 2040. </p></reply>

That means better terms and conditions for lower paid workers. Moving to a living wage is an important part of this. Of course, in doing so we need to recognise that many businesses are closed and are now loss-making, so we must do it in way that that does not cost jobs or cause people&rsquo;s working hours to be reduced. That would be counter-productive.</p><p>The current Programme for Government makes the commitment to &ldquo;progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government&rdquo;.</p><p>This commitment forms part of a balanced approach to achieving an improved standard of living for the most vulnerable in our society. </p><p>I have asked the Low Pay Commission to begin examining the issues around this commitment and to make recommendations on the best approach to achieving it within the lifetime of the Government, as part of its work programme for 2021.  That work has started and the Low Pay Commission  will provide a report to me in the second half of this year.</p><p>The report will consider the policy, social and economic implications of a move to a living wage and the process by which Ireland could progress towards a living wage. </p><p>It will do this by looking at international evidence on living wages, examining different calculation methods and examining the policy implications of moving to a living wage in Ireland.</p><p>Following its completion, the Commission will submit the report to me for consideration.</p><p>The recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s report will inform the Government on the best practical approach to progress to a living wage in Ireland.</p><p>While the living wage initiative is being considered, the Government will continue to be guided by the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission with regard to any future changes in the minimum wage.</p><p>The minimum wage was established in 2000 at &pound;4.40 (&euro;5.58). Since then it has risen to &euro;10.20. </p><p>In every year since its founding in 2015, the Low Pay Commission has recommended an increase in the minimum wage and this recommendation has always been accepted and implemented by the Government. </p></reply>

It was well-received. I intend for the Plan to be published shortly. </p><p>The Plan details short and medium-term measures that will further enhance the protection of employees who find themselves in a redundancy situation due to company insolvency, in a way that does not overly impede businesses and their operations.  </p><p>The Plan includes commitments to:</p><p>- Introduce amendments to a range of legislation in areas of employment law and company law dealing with matters relating to collective redundancies following company insolvency, </p><p>- Develop a Guidance Document which will provide clear and accessible information in relation to the rights and remedies available to employees facing a collective redundancy situation following a company insolvency,</p><p>And, separately, in the area of employment law more broadly to:</p><p>- Establish an independent Employment Law Review Group, comprising expert stakeholders, which will help shape the formulation of policy and legislation to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s employment law framework remains fit for purpose and adapts to the evolving contemporary workplace.</p><p>This complementary range of measures will promote the provision of quality information, enhance participation and transparency for those workers facing a collective redundancy following company insolvency, and will also provide for continued development of employment law in general. </p><p>Work will continue, with ongoing engagement with trade unions and business representative groups, against the timeframes outlined in the Plan for Action. Government will be ready to respond as the plan progresses.</p></reply>

The vaccination roll-out is essential to this recovery and to the re-opening of society and the economy. Our vaccination programme is very successful to-date with over 2.5million doses administered at this point. As stated at the launch of the recently revised Work Safely Protocol, vaccine hesitancy has not yet emerged as a problem in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Work Safely Protocol sets out guidance for employers around vaccinations, this is contained in section D14 of the Protocol.  Fundamentally, the decision to get a vaccination against COVID-19 is voluntary and workers will therefore make their own individual decisions in this regard. There are no plans to make vaccinations mandatory in Ireland. However, employers working together with their workers and their representatives, may wish to provide advice and information on the vaccination programme, to ensure that any worker with a hesitancy has the necessary information to make an informed decision. Communication between employers and employees will be important to identify any potential problems. For example, an employer might decide that an employee who is not vaccinated should not be assigned a customer facing role and that, in these circumstances, they should be redeployed with agreement to another position within the organisation.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of employers and employees are anxious to get back to work and appreciate that having a significant cohort of the population vaccinated is a positive development for the post pandemic recovery.</p></reply>

In exercising that competence at the World Trade Organisation or WTO, the European Commission engages with Member States, including Ireland, through a variety of Committee and Working Parties/Groups, including on intellectual property, or IP.</p>  <p>  South Africa and India have amended their original proposal for a waiver by broadening the scope to cover all health products and technologies including diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, medical devices, personal protective equipment, their materials or components, and their methods and means of manufacture for the prevention, treatment or containment of COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  The announcement by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai regarding the U.S. Government&rsquo;s support for a waiver of IP protections for COVID-19 vaccines, is significant. However, the statement acknowledged that reaching agreement on this at the WTO will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  The President of the EU Commission has responded to the U.S. announcement by indicating its readiness to discuss the U.S. proposal at the WTO. Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions including discussions on how the U.S. announcement for a waiver on intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines can help to resolve the crisis.</p>  <p>  The EU continues to be committed to an open and comprehensive dialogue with all WTO members to explore how the multilateral rules-based trading system can best support universal and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.</p>  <p>The EU believes that the WTO international agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (The TRIPS Agreement), allows countries the flexibility to respond to the concerns raised by proponents of the wavier.  Specifically, the TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing which is when a government permits an entity to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.</p>  <p>  The EU also believes that voluntary licensing and the dissemination of technology and know-how is the more effective way of quickly scaling up manufacturing globally. To this end, at the EU level, the Commission has set-up a Task Force for Industrial Scale-up of COVID-19 vaccine production which aims to support the ramp-up of production capacity and resolve supply chain bottlenecks.</p>  <p>  The EU considers that the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global supply and access to COVID vaccines, is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.</p>  <p>  The EU also considers that investment in global manufacturing capacity is key to supporting the global vaccination effort and the EU Commission is supporting a number of initiatives to achieve this, such as, the &euro;1 billion Team Europe initiative on manufacturing and access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies in Africa. </p></reply>

This compares to 598,000 workers that were in receipt of PUP on 5 May last year.  </p><p>The gradual easing of restrictions has already seen the number of people in receipt of the PUP decrease across the worst affected sectors and the economy as a whole in 2021.  </p><p>PUP recipients in the Construction sector have decreased by more than half, falling from 62,902 in February to 28,758 in May. Over the month of May, PUP recipients in the Wholesale and Retail Sector fell from 65,984 to 54,391 as outlets reopened.

In recognition of the critical work of those Irish-based companies, last October I convened a series of short meetings with several of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s biopharmaceutical client companies to hear about the crucial role they are playing in the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and particularly on the work being done in Ireland to assist in the global efforts to combat COVID-19. It was clear from these meetings and IDA Ireland's ongoing mapping of the sector that, at the time, there was no available capacity within these existing pharmaceutical plants to produce COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>In recent weeks, a global client of IDA Ireland, Pfizer, announced plans that it is to manufacture a COVID -19 vaccine drug substance at its facility in Dublin. Expansion plans at this site will allow for the extra production that will be part of the global vaccine supply chain network, contributing to the worldwide supply of the vaccine. This represents a vote of confidence in the Irish life-sciences sector. </p><p>Separate to existing capacity, the COVID-19 Products Scheme was developed jointly by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland under the European Commission Temporary Framework that allows additional aid to be granted by EU Member States to companies that are developing or producing medicinal products used in the fight against COVID-19.</p><p>IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are supporting a range of companies with product and process solutions of relevance to the ongoing global response to tackling Covid-19. This includes some projects in the area of vaccines as well as many other projects in areas such as PPE production, medical devices, sanitisers &amp;amp; sanitising equipment and diagnostic tests, all of which remain important responses to the Covid-19 challenge.</p><p>In the area of vaccine production, Enterprise Ireland has identified Irish companies that can offer solutions to the bottleneck of vaccine production, including specialist services underpinning vaccine manufacturing and related laboratory works etc. Enterprise Ireland is currently working with client companies in these areas to deliver on their proposals under the COVID-19 Products Scheme.  </p></reply>

Information on the wide range of supports can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/</i>.</p><p>To date over businesses have benefited by more than &euro;6.5 billion in Wage supports and Employer PRSI foregone. Taxes owing to the Exchequer to the tune of &euro;2.3 billion have been warehoused by over 85,000 businesses. Restart Grants saw over &euro;630 million paid directly to businesses and a further &euro;48.5 million has been set aside for payment via the SBASC grant. CRSS payments have totalled over &euro;533 million. The total allocation for the Sustaining Enterprise Fund Scheme being provided in 2021 in my Department&rsquo;s new estimate is &euro;175m.</p><p>The SBCI Working Capital Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme and the upcoming Brexit Impact Loan Scheme are each underpinned by a state guarantee (provided through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland), with counter-guarantees from the European Investment Fund (EIF). The guarantees under these schemes are secured with Exchequer funding, with additional Exchequer costs related to administration of the schemes. The Exchequer costs for the schemes arise in accordance with the agreed schedules with SBCI and EIF. </p><p>The guarantee schemes operating under the Credit Guarantee Act, which includes the CCGS, are based on contingent liability. This means that there is no cost to the State unless a participating enterprise is unable to pay back the loan for more than 90 days, whereupon the loan enters a default stage, and the finance provider can call on the guarantee for 80 percent of the outstanding balance. These demands will be called on through the operator of the scheme, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).There have been no calls on the guarantee to date.  Operational and legal costs associated with implementation of the scheme from 1 January 2021 to 27 May 2021 amounted to &euro;935,702.  A value of &euro;25.5 million has been included in the Estimates for 2021 to meet operational costs and any claims which might arise under the scheme.</p><p>The costs for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the first and second half of 2021 across the different schemes are set out in the table below/attached. </p></reply>

It is available to SMEs and small mid-caps (business with less than 500 employees), including primary producers (businesses engaged in the farming and seafood sectors).  The Scheme is available until 31 December 2021 following a Government decision in March to extend it in line with the extension of the European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary Framework on State Aid.</p><p>In order to provide the public with relevant data on the performance of the scheme, my Department publishes weekly and monthly reports on its website.

The Government is pursuing a two-pronged recovery approach; a focus on domestic SMEs, whilst leveraging and reinforcing the enormous strength and resilience of the Foreign Direct Investment sector in Ireland and its indispensable contribution to communities across the country.</p>  <p>  The twin decarbonisation and digitalisation transition and associated behavioural changes will profoundly alter the economy. Embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and support significant job creation.  Automation will have both positive and negative implications, however, the emerging consensus is that more occupations will change than will be automated away. Innovation, collaboration and knowledge are the cornerstone of a sustainable growth model and a prosperous renewed economy equipped to excel in a changing world.  The education, training and research sectors will be supported to shift up a gear to rise to the challenge. </p>  <p>  Our Economic Recovery plan also commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework and architecture to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment through opportunities to reskill and upskill. This will include a comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s skills strategies and approaches, including the National Skills Strategy 2016-2025; developing a web-based &ldquo;Skills Platform&rdquo;, for upskilling and reskilling opportunities; and developing Ireland&rsquo;s Pact for Skills, between businesses and government, to ensure those with low and no qualifications are not excluded from employment</p>  <p>  Accelerating the provision of training, reskilling and upskilling opportunities and increased activation will be pursued through Pathways to Work 2021-2025.  We will also work intensively with young people who are at greater risk of long-term unemployment. And as the recovery of the labour market progresses, an increasing focus will be placed on improving labour market participation levels. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile and supporting people to transition to new jobs in growing sectors of the economy.</p></reply>

This approach uses multiple layers and disparate systems to deliver security which is not dependent on any single component.  Given the heightened level of risk which currently exists, my Department&rsquo;s technical staff has adopted a posture of increased vigilance and oversight of systems.</p><p>My Department is taking advice from its own external security advisers, and is also monitoring advice and guidance coming from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on any additional steps which should be implemented in the light of current risks.  This advice is also being shared with the State agencies under the remit of my Department, who are evaluating this advice in the context of their own cyber security arrangements.  </p><p>On foot of the current increased threat levels from cyber criminals and the advice from the NCSC, my Department has implemented a number of additional controls, and has also reviewed existing controls to ensure that they are still being applied consistently.</p><p>An independent review of my Department&rsquo;s cyber security controls was carried out in 2019.  The review was based on the ISO 27001 standard for good practice in an information security management system. Overall, the review found that the Department&rsquo;s security posture was rated as good and above the standard which is usually seen in its sector. The review has also been used as the basis for an ongoing programme of further improvements to information security standards. Given the current threat levels and the significant resources which cyber criminals are prepared to use to hack into systems, it is important that we are not complacent in our approach to cyber security. Cyber security is an ongoing process in my Department, and we will continue to review the controls we have in place and implement new controls and protections where necessary and as new cyber defence technologies become available.</p><p>For operational and security reasons, we are advised by the NCSC not to disclose details of systems and processes which could in any way compromise cyber security measures in place in public bodies. In particular, it is not considered appropriate to disclose information which might assist criminals to identify potential vulnerabilities in departmental cybersecurity arrangements.</p><p>Therefore, it is not considered appropriate to disclose particular arrangements in place in relation to cyber security tools and services, and my Department does not comment on operational security matters.</p></reply>

Support for business includes the weekly Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) of payment for businesses forced to close their doors to the public, the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), the lower Tourism VAT rate of 9% further extended to September 2022, a commercial rates waiver extended in its current form for another three months, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme as well as low-cost loans. Information on the wide range of supports can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website .</p><p>Government is in no doubt how important the COVID supports such as the EWSS and CRSS have been to businesses and the role played by grant schemes such as the Restart Grants, SBASC and the various sectoral supports administered by relevant Departments.</p><p>The CRSS has provided vital support to businesses that have been forced to close or restrict access to their premises on foot of public health regulations. The CRSS has been extended until the end of 2021 and enhanced with a significantly higher restart payment &ndash; three weeks at double rate of payment (to a maximum of &euro;30,000).</p><p>Further targeted supports have also been introduced including a new additional Business Resumption Support Scheme from September for businesses with significantly reduced turnover.</p><p>I am acutely aware of the difficulties SME's continue to face due to this pandemic and that is why I have expanded the SBASC scheme which will now take into account businesses who do not pay rates and also businesses that have a turnover below &euro;50,000.  Phase 2 of this scheme will be open for applications in early June, with a closing date of 21st July.  Further details of the scheme including all eligibility criteria will shortly be available on my Department's website www.enterprise.gov.ie and on Local Authority websites.</p><p>We are committed to the economic recovery of the country and work is ongoing across Government to ensure the supports which will be in place are sufficient, targeted and sustainable. The National Recovery Plan will chart the pathway forward for our country. </p><p>My colleague, Minister Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, may be able to provide more specific details on these supports for the hospitality sector, for which she has lead responsibility.</p></reply>

The Plan&rsquo;s overarching ambition is to have 2.5 million people in work by 2024, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment across all regions will be a particular focus of the forthcoming Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which will involve intensive work with young people at greater risk of long-term unemployment, in recognition of the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on young people. As part of a new Government Youth Employment Charter, a new ambitious EU Reinforced Youth Guarantee process will see intensive engagement with young jobseekers, and an expanded Jobs Plus scheme, with 8,000 places overall, will continue to provide a higher incentive for the recruitment of young unemployed people across all regions.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment will also be addressed through measures such as the rollout of an additional 50,000 education and training places, a new Work Placement Experience Programme targeted at reaching 10,000 participants, SOLAS&rsquo;s Recovery Skills Response Programme, and implementation of the new Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which will grow new apprentice registrations to 10,000 per annum by 2025.</p>  <p>  Ensuring the skills of young people are aligned with the needs of enterprise will complement pillars 3 and 4 of the Economic Recovery Plan, which aims at building sustainable enterprises, through the creation of the right environment for a jobs-led recovery, and at achieving a balanced and inclusive recovery. This will include initiatives to enhance SME productivity, internationalisation, digitalisation and decarbonisation, Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition for Foreign Direct Investment, and our innovative knowledge economy. The revised National Development Plan, new Housing for All Strategy, retrofit supports, &euro;500m Shared Island Fund and Rural Development Policy will also support a rebalancing of the regions as we recover from the impacts of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  At a regional level, the North West Regional Enterprise Plan, which is now being renewed until 2024, will build upon these commitments and play a central role in supporting balanced regional enterprise development across the North West, including Donegal. It will do so by identifying growth opportunities, recognising vulnerabilities, and in response strengthening the regional enterprise ecosystem to enable job creation, including for the benefit of young people.</p></reply>

It also reinforces the Parties' commitments to multilateral environmental agreements to which it is a party, including the Paris Agreement, which is an important shared responsibility for the European Union and its Member States and Canada.</p>  <p>  Importantly, in CETA, both sides also agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  On the contrary, the EU and Canada are committed to ensuring that CETA helps ensure that economic growth, social development, and environmental protection go hand in hand.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission published a Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment relating to the negotiation of CETA in June 2011.  This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the potential impacts of trade liberalisation under CETA.  The impact analysis assesses the economic, social and environmental impacts in Canada and the European Union, in three main sectors, sixteen sub-sectors and seven cross-cutting issues.  In addition to examining potential gains from removing factors affecting the free flow of goods, services and capital, consideration is given to areas such as labour mobility, government procurement, intellectual property rights, telecoms services and e-commerce.  </p>  <p>  Overall, the sustainability impact assessment found that the impacts to Canada and the European Union would not be significant.  The analysis also finds that CETA will lead to overall gains in welfare, real GDP, total exports and real wages in both Canada and the EU over the long-term.</p>  <p>  So, I am satisfied that CETA will not negatively impact, in aggregate, on Ireland's, or the EU's capacity to meet our Climate Change goals.  Moreover, our respective Climate Change Goals are enhanced when improved trade and investment flows for our people support an ambitious Trade and Sustainability, Green and Digital Transition, as applies in the EU and Canada. </p></reply>

In exercising that competence at the World Trade Organisation or WTO, the European Commission engages with Member States, including Ireland, through a variety of Committee and Working Parties/Groups, including on intellectual property, or IP.</p>  <p>  South Africa and India have amended their original proposal for a waiver by broadening the scope to cover all health products and technologies including diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, medical devices, personal protective equipment, their materials or components, and their methods and means of manufacture for the prevention, treatment or containment of COVID-19.  The revised proposal also provides that the waiver shall be in force for at least 3 years and the WTO General Council shall determine the date of termination of the waiver.</p>  <p>  The announcement by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai regarding the U.S. Government&rsquo;s support for a waiver of IP protections for COVID-19 vaccines, is significant. However, the statement acknowledged that reaching agreement on this at the WTO will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  The President of the EU Commission has responded to the U.S. announcement by indicating its readiness to discuss the U.S. proposal at the WTO. Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions including discussions on how the U.S. announcement for a waiver on intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines can help to resolve the crisis.</p>  <p>  The EU continues to be committed to an open and comprehensive dialogue with all WTO members to explore how the multilateral rules-based trading system can best support universal and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.</p>  <p>  The EU believes that the WTO international agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (The TRIPS Agreement), allows countries the flexibility to respond to the concerns raised by proponents of the wavier.  Specifically, the TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing which is when a government permits an entity to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.</p>  <p>The EU also believes that voluntary licensing and the dissemination of technology and know-how is the more effective way of quickly scaling up manufacturing globally. To this end, at the EU level, the Commission has set-up a Task Force for Industrial Scale-up of COVID-19 vaccine production which aims to support the ramp-up of production capacity and resolve   supply chain bottlenecks.</p>  <p>  The EU considers that the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global supply and access to COVID vaccines, is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.</p>  <p>  The EU also considers that investment in global manufacturing capacity is key to supporting the global vaccination effort and the EU Commission is supporting a number of initiatives to achieve this, such as, the &euro;1 billion Team Europe initiative on manufacturing and access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies in Africa.</p></reply>

The number of individuals from the construction sector claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) rose steadily in the early weeks of the year and reached a high of 62,902 claimants on the 9th February this year. </p><p>The phased reopening of the construction sector, beginning on 12th April with the recommencement of all residential construction projects, saw a sizeable decline in the number of PUP claimants. The full reopening of all construction on 4th May saw further improvements and the number of PUP claimants from the construction sector has now more than halved, with only 28,758 claims related to the construction sector on the 25th May. </p><p>This shows that more and more construction workers have seen their jobs restored as the sector re-opens.  </p><p>A further support for the construction sector that has helped maintain employment has been the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). As was the case with PUP, the number of employees in the construction sector that were supported by the EWSS increased sharply in January 2021. </p><p>This vital scheme continues to provide valuable financial assistance to employers and has helped ensure employees remain within the sector, with almost 37,600 employees participating in April 2021. </p><p>There are also steps being taken to ensure the skills and employment levels required by the construction sector are in place for the future. These are being delivered across Further and Higher Education, through apprenticeship, non-apprenticeship further education and training, mainstream education and training, as well as specific programmes such as Springboard+, the Human Capital Initiative and Skillnet Ireland. </p></reply>

It will serve as a roadmap to how Ireland can leverage the potential offered by AI technologies and ensure the appropriate safeguards are in place so that AI is developed and used in a manner that is fair, transparent and builds public trust. </p>  <p>  The vision of the Strategy is that Ireland will be an international leader in using AI to the benefit of our population, through a people-centred, ethical approach to AI development, adoption and use. By delivering on this vision, AI will play its part in making Ireland a better place to work and live &ndash; fairer, greener, more prosperous and more successful in the global marketplace.</p>  <p>  The strategy will set out an approach to leveraging AI for economic and societal benefit. It will also look at the main enablers for widespread development, adoption and use of AI, including a strong innovation ecosystem, skills and talent, and a supportive data and digital infrastructure.

The reporting for these schemes includes details on the uptake of schemes at county level, but more granular details are not provided. </p>  <p>  These include the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, which makes available up to &euro;2 billion in lending for terms of up to five-and-a-half years. These loans may be used for liquidity as well as for investment purposes, which means that this support may be of assistance to businesses in need of liquidity support post-lockdown. These loans are available at interest rates below market value for similar loans without a State guarantee.</p>  <p>  Up to 20 May 2021, there had been 5,005 loans approved under the scheme, to a total value of &euro;309.80m. As of the same date, there had been 1,092 loans drawn by businesses in Dublin, to a total value of &euro;90,643,189.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme makes relatively short-term working capital lending available to pandemic-impacted businesses. Loans under this scheme must be used to innovate, change or adapt in response to the impacts of the pandemic. These loans are offered for terms of up to three years, at a maximum interest rate of 4%. </p>  <p>  To date (31 May), there have been 1,025 loans approved to sanction under this scheme, to a total value of &euro;140.18m. Per-county uptake figures for this scheme are made available as part of quarterly reports on the scheme. The most recent report is that to the end of Q4 2020. As of this report, there had been 309 loans drawn by businesses based in Dublin, to a total value of &euro;36.77m.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme offers lending under similar terms to the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, however it is made available to eligible Brexit-exposed businesses. To date (24 May), there have been 291 loans approved to sanction under the scheme, to a total value of &euro;58.53m. As of the most recent quarterly report (Q4 2020), there had been 102 loans drawn by businesses based in Dublin, to a total value of &euro;19.4m.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was launched in 2019 and was expanded by &euro;500m in July of 2020 to bring the total available lending under this scheme up to &euro;800m to assist long term, strategic investment by eligible businesses, including in response to Brexit and COVID-19. Loans under this scheme are for terms of 7-10 years. </p>  <p>  To date (31 May), there have been 3,315 loans approved to sanction under this scheme, to a total value of &euro;685.4m. Per-county uptake figures for this scheme are made available as part of quarterly reports on the scheme. The most recent report is that to the end of Q4 2020. As of this report, there had been 243 loans drawn under the scheme by businesses in Dublin, to a total value of &euro;80.72m.</p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund operated by Microfinance Ireland assists businesses with fewer than ten employees. It provides much-needed funding to help microenterprises meet payments for stock, working capital requirements and other overhead expenses through the provision of low-cost lending facilities.</p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to business that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders.  It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk.  Loans are available for up to &euro;25,000, with interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 5.5% on the Covid-19 Business Loan and from 6.8% to 7.8% on standard business loans. </p>  <p>  Between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, MFI approved 296 loans to businesses in Dublin, to a total value of &euro;7.4m. </p></reply>

My Departmental colleague, Minister Robert Troy is driving the delivery of the new Plan in the North-West. The new Regional Enterprise Plan to 2024 for the North West is expected to be completed in Quarter 3 this year.</p>  <p>  The Government has put several funding streams in place to support regional development. Under my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) administered by Enterprise Ireland, the North-West region has secured total funding of over &euro;5.6 million across five projects. The ring-fenced Border Enterprise Development Fund has seen almost &euro;9 million approved for four projects in the North-West for enterprise ecosystem strengthening projects that will assist in mitigating the challenges for businesses in the region in the face of Brexit. These Funds are supporting significant collaborative and innovative regional projects that when complete will provide a timely impetus to job creation in the North West.</p>  <p>  Through Enterprise Ireland my Department has introduced new funding to sustain companies, including those in the North-West, and assist them to navigate the economic impact of Covid-19. These include: the Sustaining Enterprise Fund; the Covid-19 Business Planning Grant; the Lean Business Continuity Support; the Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme; and the Covid-19 Enterprise Centres Fund.</p>  <p>  In 2020, 235 Enterprise Ireland client companies employing 6,725 people were operating in the North-West region. The North-West Region is serviced by IDA Ireland offices in Sligo and Donegal, dealing with a base of 50 client companies who collectively employ 7,129 people. IDA will target 25 investments for the Border region in the period 2021 to 2024.  IDA will deliver advanced building solutions in Letterkenny and Sligo in the same period. The region is well serviced with a range of Business and Technology Parks, with further upgrade works progressing on IDA parks in Donegal and Sligo to ensure that the North West remains an attractive proposition for existing clients and potential new FDI. </p>  <p>  This work will be backed up by this week's Economic Recovery Plan and other forthcoming government plans, such as the updated National Development Plan, which will seek to achieve regionally balanced growth.</p></reply>

Moreover, where such agreements cover investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments. The ICS in CETA reflects reforms promoted by the EU which address the concerns that had previously been raised by NGOs and others regarding the old Investor-State-Dispute-Settlement mechanism - or ISDS &ndash; on issues such as transparency, legitimacy and public interest.   </p>  <p>  However, it is important to remember that a Canadian firm can seek to sue the government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our Courts whether CETA exists or not.  CETA simply provides an arbitration alternative - the ICS.  Importantly, that alternative, unlike a challenge in the Courts, cannot find any act by Government to be ultra vires or unconstitutional - it is only concerned with redress for proven harm by discriminatory actions or unfair or inequitable treatment as set out in CETA.</p>  <p>  The ICS provides a single, consistent mechanism where investors, be they Canadian or European, can seek redress.  However, under CETA the right of Member States (and Canada) to regulate for public policies (e.g. in health, environment, security) is fully preserved, and it is made clear that the Agreement does not imply an expectation that public policies will remain unchanged.  Further, an investor&rsquo;s loss of profits will not be sufficient grounds for making a claim against a Government.  Any claim must be based on discriminatory and unfair treatment.  Investors will retain the option of utilising either national courts or the ICS but are precluded from using both, to avoid forum shopping.  All documentation in a dispute will be publicly available including decisions and third parties such as NGOs will be able to participate.</p>  <p>  Moreover, CETA also provides a forum for civil society advisory groups to submit opinions or make recommendations in relation to matters related to the Trade and Environment Chapter of CETA.  CETA further encourages inter-government cooperation on environmental related issues and cooperation in international forums.  In this regard, the CETA civil society forum has met on three occasions to date, most recently on 8/9 December 2020 where parties discussed the potential for future collaboration between Civil Society Organisations and the EU and Canada on issues such as Gender equality in access to trade opportunities, SMEs and Climate Action and the Paris Agreement.</p>  <p>  In summary, what ICS does is provide a reformed alternative for investors where they may be in dispute with a State, alleging discrimination or unfair treatment.  On the other hand, any investor can always, to use the Deputy's term, be held "accountable" before different domestic or EU fora, as all investors in Ireland are subject to the same national and EU legal order and obligations, notwithstanding CETA.</p></reply>

19, IDA Ireland migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms. The use of digital platforms by IDA staff has contributed to an enhanced digital engagement with existing clients and also in hosting E-Site visits with potential new investors.2020 figures are consequently a combination of &lsquo;in person&rsquo; visits and &lsquo;E-visits&rsquo;. details of which are set out below:</p><p>- TThe table below sets out the details of the amount of funding expended by the IDA in each county in each of the past 5 years, as requested by the Deputy. Note that payments shown in the table relate to grants paid.  There are several reasons why certain counties might have registered a small or zero figure in any given year. The grant may be paid in a different year than approved. Grants are for specific projects and the life time of these is generally 3-5 years, so although a small or zero figure is shown it does not necessarily mean there was no activity. And finally the number of FDI companies in a particular county will affect the number/amounts of grants paid in that county. <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2019

This legislation will provide myself and the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with the powers to enter into a legal agreement with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) for the delivery of the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme.</p>  <p>  An Open Call to lenders has been launched by the SBCI to invite expressions of interest from banks and non-bank lenders to participate in the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme. This Open Call will remain live until the 9th of June, after which a review process will determine successful applicants.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme will be underpinned by a counter-guarantee from the European Investment Fund [EIF] through the pan-European Guarantee Fund. The effect of this counter-guarantee is that the EIF will take a risk share of 56% for the scheme, with SBCI taking 24% and lenders for the scheme taking a 20% risk share. </p>  <p>  A number of legal agreements need to be in place for the scheme to launch. Negotiations on the counter-guarantee between the EIF and the SBCI are already under way, while the cooperation agreement between myself and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the SBCI for delivery of the scheme is also being developed. Guarantee agreements between the SBCI and each of the lenders successful in their application for participation in the scheme will also need to be completed.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the first lenders under the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme will launch in the early half of July 2021, with further lenders coming on board as soon as possible thereafter.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme will replace the existing Brexit Loan Scheme. This new scheme will provide for a number of enhancements for Brexit-impacted SMEs seeking to access finance, including: removal of the innovation eligibility criterion, providing funding for primary producers, offering longer loan terms of up to six years, and lending for a wider range of loan purposes, including refinancing (of remaining Brexit Loan Scheme loan balances and for existing short-term credit up to a maximum of 30% of any new loan) and financing to support cash flow and for investment. </p>  <p>  The enhanced scheme has been developed in the context of the additional complexities and implications that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about for Brexit impacted businesses, and will be an important instrument in ensuring that Brexit impacted SMEs have an appropriate option for accessing low cost lending as the impacts of Brexit and COVID-19 continue to be felt.</p></reply>

The impact of both the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit have posed significant challenges for businesses and it is vital that businesses continue to develop their resilience in the face of these and future challenges.  </p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank businesses and their customers for their continued support of the national effort through this unprecedented public health crisis.</p><p>As the largest private sector employer, and a key element in providing for the needs of society and indeed other sectors of the economy, it is vital that retail continues to develop capability and remains competitive.  </p><p>It is important that there is a strong, diverse, and balanced retail business presence across the country which sustains the local and domestic economy and contributes to the export economy, both online and offline.</p><p>A long-term goal for the overall retail sector prior to the pandemic was to scale up online offerings to complement physical outlets.  </p><p>This goal has been accelerated due to the pandemic, and I want to see this digital development of the sector continue.  Indeed, my Department has provided specific funding though the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme and the Trading Online Vouchers Scheme to assist the retail sector in their efforts.</p><p>For many retailers, developing their digital capability and enhancing their physical retail offering with a strong online presence will support them to become more resilient. </p><p>I am determined to support that ambition and assist our businesses to increase their digital presence and boost online sales allowing them to target new and existing customers and shoppers in the online space. </p><p>It also provides consumers with more opportunities to support local businesses in their community, even when shopping online.  </p><p>I want the retail sector to continue to develop and to become one of our most innovative and resilient sectors, so that those working in retail can be confident about building a long term career in retail.</p><p>As Minister, I will support this by continuing to work collaboratively with the sector and to address issues directly affecting the retail sector.</p><p>My Department is undertaking a Retail Sector Study to look at the future of the Retail Sector.

Applicant companies must be an indigenous retailer, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. The Scheme was launched with an initial fund size of &euro;2m. Due to significant levels of interest for the Scheme from eligible retailers and the particular challenges facing the retail sector during the pandemic, the funding available for Call 1 was increased.  </p><p>Under the first call 185 retailers were approved &euro;6.6m in funding and under the second call 145 retailers were approved &euro;5.3m in funding.  </p><p>On 4 May, this year, Minister of State English launched a new round of the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme. Under this call &euro;5 million will be made available to help Irish businesses to upgrade their websites and improve their competitiveness in online retail.  The call closed on the 25 May and Enterprise Ireland tell me that they have received 293 applications.  A detailed due diligence and assessment process has commenced. The objective is that this will be concluded with formal notification being given to successful applications in late June. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme administered through the Local Enterprise Offices.  It offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 with co-funding of 50% from the business along with training and advice to help businesses trade online.  </p></reply>

The webpage also includes an employer checklist to provide employers with a quick way to navigate the adoption of remote working arrangements.</p><p>This year, on January 15,  my Department published &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo;, the National Remote Work Strategy. The objective of the Strategy is to ensure that remote work is a permanent feature in the Irish workplace in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits. The report is built on three pillars which are bolstered by underpinning conditions. These pillars are:</p><p>1. Create a Conducive Environment </p><p>2. Develop and Leverage a Remote Work Infrastructure</p><p>3. Build a Remote Work Policy and Guidance Framework </p><p>Under these pillars and the underpinning conditions there are 15 actions to progress remote working into the future. The Strategy outlines the Departments and State Agencies responsible for the delivery of each of the actions. Each of these actions has a deadline of Q1, 3, or 4 of this year. </p><p>My Department is leading on the implementation of the Strategy. Lead actors report the progress on their actions to the Interdepartmental Group on Remote Work. This Group has met twice to date this year, with the most recent meeting taking place last week, on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  At this meeting it was established that actions to date have been met and that progress is underway to achieving the remaining actions by the end of the year.

A robust property and infrastructure ecosystem can be the key differentiator in winning FDI projects. Over the last 5 years, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations.</p>  <p>  In May 2020 Meissner Filtration Products announced that their new manufacturing facility in Co.

IDA Ireland will deliver 19 Advanced Building Solutions (ABS) to regional locations, including one in Mayo.  The national capital investment plans outlined in the new IDA Ireland strategy, subject to planning permission and public procurement process, are expected to commence and be delivered within the term of the new strategy at all identified locations.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland will also partner with Local Authorities and the private sector to deliver additional buildings in key locations where appropriate. </p>  <p>  In each region, IDA Ireland will invest in significant infrastructure projects across its portfolio of Business and Technology Parks to upgrade and maintain these key assets in line with the evolving requirements of IDA Ireland and EI clients. IDA Ireland will also maintain a focus on land banks and utility intensive strategic sites to future proof its property portfolio to support the project pipeline, most notably large-scale capital-intensive projects which can have significant regional and national economic impacts. Additional upgrade works, and investment are planned for IDA Ireland Parks in the West region and IDA Ireland is currently engaged with Mayo County Council to progress a partnership to develop additional business park and strategic lands for future development.</p></reply>

It identifies the opportunities for sustainable growth among IDA&rsquo;s established base of clients through a focus on transformative investments to increase the productivity of Irish operations and their workforce through RD&amp;amp;I, digitisation, training and actions on sustainability. Crucially it also maintains a focus on attracting the next generation of leading MNCs to locate in Ireland, further driving sustainable growth and maximising the impact of FDI in Ireland to 2024 and beyond. </p><p>The new strategy will be delivered through a focus on five pillars: Growth, Transformation, Regions, Sustainability and Impact. These five interlinked pillars align with and are guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p><p>There are 44 IDA client companies in the Midlands region, employing 6,308 people. The FDI performance in the region has been strong over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing by 35%. The region has an impressive range of companies across all industry sectors, with particular strengths in Life Sciences, Technology, Global Business Services, International Financial Services, and Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies. The Midlands includes the regional growth centre of Athlone. The existing FDI base of client companies in the region continues to perform well in terms of their operational sustainability, job retention and ongoing transformation.  </p><p>The announcement that Athlone Institute of Technology is to form a consortium with Limerick Institute of Technology to develop a new technological university (TU) for the Midlands and Mid-West will further strengthen the potential of the region. </p><p>IDA will continue to work closely with the private sector in the Midlands to secure the provision of appropriate and cost-effective building and property solutions for client companies.</p><p>In the new strategy, IDA will build on the strengths and competencies of the region with a particular focus on high value manufacturing, services and RD&amp;amp;I opportunities.

The Plan commits to a range of supports and policies that will invest in businesses and workers; help people get back into work, training or education; provide enhanced support for sectors that will lag behind and invest in infrastructure and reforms that enhance our capability and long-term capacity for growth.  </p>  <p>   As SMEs account for over two thirds of total employment, a strong focus on indigenous SMEs is critical to a jobs-led recovery. The Government is pursuing a two-pronged recovery approach; a focus on domestic SMEs, whilst leveraging and reinforcing the enormous strength and resilience of the Foreign Direct Investment sector in Ireland and its indispensable contribution to communities across the country.</p>  <p>  The twin decarbonisation and digitalisation transition and associated behavioural changes will profoundly alter the economy. Embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and support significant job creation.  Automation will have both positive and negative implications, however, the emerging consensus is that more occupations will change than will be automated away. Innovation, collaboration and knowledge are the cornerstone of a sustainable growth model and a prosperous renewed economy equipped to excel in a changing world.  The education, training and research sectors will be supported to shift up a gear to rise to the challenge.  </p>  <p>  In building towards recovery, it must be recognised that not all previous jobs will return, while capacity constraints may emerge in other areas.  Our Economic Recovery plan also commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework and architecture to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment through opportunities to reskill and upskill. This will include a comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s skills strategies and approaches, including the National Skills Strategy 2016-2025; developing a web-based &ldquo;Skills Platform&rdquo;, for upskilling and reskilling opportunities; and developing Ireland&rsquo;s Pact for Skills, between businesses and government, to ensure those with low and no qualifications are not excluded from employment.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile, by increasing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, and through a focus on expanding sectors.</p></reply>

This position is common across all Government Departments.</p><p>International Trade is a competence vested in the European Commission under the EU Treaties whereby the Union's negotiating strength is as a bloc of 27 Member States representing some 450 million citizens. As such, actions, decisions and negotiations conducted by the Commission on behalf of the Member States are more impactful than unilateral action by a single Member State.</p><p>Ireland and Israel have no bilateral trade or investment agreements. Trade relations between the EU and Israel are governed by a Free Trade Agreement that is part of the 2000 EU-Israel Association Agreement whereby the EU and Israel have continuously worked on improving trade and economic relations and have signed several agreements to that end:</p><p>- Agreement on agriculture and fisheries which greatly improved market access (2010)</p><p>- &quot;Open Skies&quot; aviation agreement (fully entered into force in 2018) which further opened EU-Israel air travel and the related Eurocontrol association agreement (2016) which helps to coordinate air traffic and ensures security</p><p>- Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of industrial products (ACAA) which currently brings mutual recognition of pharmaceutical certification</p><p>In addition, as confirmed in the 2015 &ldquo;Interpretative Notice on indication of origin of goods from the territories occupied by Israel since June 1967&rdquo;, the European Union, in line with international law, does not recognise Israel&rsquo;s sovereignty over the territories occupied by Israel since June 1967, namely the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and does not consider them to be part of Israel&rsquo;s territory, irrespective of their legal status under domestic Israeli law. Products requiring origin labelling which are produced in Israeli settlements may not carry the indication &lsquo;product of Israel&rsquo; as settlements do not form part of Israeli territory according to international law,  and such an indication would be incorrect and misleading.</p><p>All trade measures must be compatible with World Trade Organisation rules and with the principles and rules governing the operation of the Single Market. In light of the issue of  the EU legal competence mentioned already, potentially illegal trade measures by either the Union or by individual Member States, measures which would be impossible to enforce operationally, would only serve to undermine EU and Irish government efforts as regards the Middle East Peace Process.</p><p>In relation to the very latest developments in the long-running Israeli/Palestinian conflict and the EU's collective responses, these are led, in the first instance, by the EU's Foreign Affairs Council where Ireland is represented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p></reply>

The work of a social media moderator involves exposure to potentially harmful material the impact of which is a potential hazard to the worker. It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to identify, control and reduce impact of workplace hazards. </p><p>Social media content moderators should be treated by an employer in the same way as any other worker potentially exposed to work related hazards. The employer must carry out a robust risk assessment with a particular focus on the potential hazards arising from work activities and must provide appropriate training. Where a particular hazard is identified that may require subsequent monitoring it must be included in the written Safety Statement, and the relevant worker must be made aware of the hazard and the associated monitoring that is in place.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the independent regulator for workplace safety. I am aware that the HSA is engaging with the Social Media sector to establish and assess the control measures in place to address the risks arising from specific nature of the work of content moderators. The HSA will be able to determine whether further advice or guidance is necessary for employers to ensure compliance with their duties under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p><p>I would also point out that there is provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, to ensure that an employer cannot penalise, or threaten to penalise, an employee who makes a complaint or a representation on any matter relating to health and safety at work. Any worker concerned for their health and safety can contact the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s Workplace Contact Unit in confidence at wcu@hsa.ie.</p><p>Furthermore, a full suite of employment rights legislation protects all workers legally employed on a contract of service basis. Where an individual is concerned about their employment rights they should contact the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) which is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation. The WRC can be contacted at www.workplacerelations.ie.</p><p>Separately, I would add that my colleague, Catherine Martin TD, Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, is currently advancing a regulatory framework which will deal with on-line safety and which will include the establishment of an Online Safety Commissioner.</p></reply>

Ireland has retained its AA-rating with Standard &amp;amp; Poor&rsquo;s, A+ with Fitch and A2 with Moody&rsquo;s, with all three agencies reporting a stable outlook for Irish debt. </p>  <p>  The economy is re-opening up in clear phases and the Government will continue to provide financial assistance and guidance for businesses through the recovery phase and beyond. These measures are outlined within the recently published National Economic Recovery Plan.</p>  <p>  Specifically, for businesses seeking credit in the current environment a number of schemes have been put in place to help them.

Of that figure to date 113 have been approved for payment, 37 are still being assessed and 156 applications have been refused. </p><p>The refusals have occurred due to eligibility requirements such as the business&rsquo;s turnover not being down 75% during the required period, the business not operating from a rateable premises, or the business not reaching the &euro;50k turnover requirement.</p></reply>

It is a challenging time for small business owners, employees and their families. </p>  <p>  That is why the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities, and the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to avail of these supports if they have not already done so. I would also encourage small business owners to contact their Local Enterprise Office, who can direct them to supports that may be available for their business.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that Government needs to take a long-term view with regard to the recovery by fostering growth, productivity and sustainability within the Irish SME sector. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future&rdquo; set out a commitment to draw up an ambitious long-term strategic blueprint for SMEs and entrepreneurs beyond COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, in September 2020, I established an SME Growth Taskforce comprising over 20 entrepreneurs, business leaders and other stakeholders, contributing expertise from a broad range of economic sectors and business types. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce was served by four focused sub-groups with the capacity and expertise to develop specific actions in thematic areas, drawing on the OECD Review of SME and Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland. These sub-groups focused on the areas of Entrepreneurship; Productivity, Digitalisation and Competitiveness; Internationalisation; and Clustering and Networks.</p>  <p>  This work culminated in the publication in January of this year of the SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan, which sets out a wide range of recommendations with long-term strategic relevance for SMEs and entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>  The recommendations in the Report include measures to help SMEs and entrepreneurs to start up, scale up and access foreign markets, as well as recommendations aimed at helping SMEs to become more productive and ready for the transition to a digital, green economy. </p>  <p>  These recommendations, while not yet Government policy, are now being considered by a Ministerial-led SME &amp;amp; Entrepreneurship Implementation Group, which was established in February to progress the Report&rsquo;s recommendations. </p>  <p>  The Implementation Group has been meeting with Departments and Agencies with responsibility for delivery of relevant actions, with a view to taking these proposals forward. This is a key element of the plans to support the domestic SME sector that have been set out in the National Economic Recovery Plan.</p></reply>

Work on this Bill is currently ongoing in my Department. </p>  <p>  Minister McEntee and I met with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, in December last to discuss the issues of pet theft and animal welfare legislation. We all agreed to a collaborative approach to dealing with the issue. As you will be aware, Minister McConalogue's Department is the lead Department for all animal welfare issues.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice is kept appraised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the issue of pet theft. </p>  <p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, the theft of an animal carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment on conviction. If the animal was taken from a person's property the crime becomes burglary and attracts a potential maximum of up to 14 years imprisonment.  These are significant sentences by any measure.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act for the administration and management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including all operational policing decisions. This includes crime prevention initiatives and strategies. Neither I, nor the Minister, have a role in these independent functions and that is entirely correct. </p>  <p>  With regard to measures aimed at preventing such thefts, I am informed by the Garda authorities that information has been disseminated to the Crime Prevention Officers' Network countrywide specifically dealing with the topic of dog thefts. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety concurs with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe.</p>  <p>  Ongoing patrols throughout the country also act as a deterrent to mobile criminals and thereby help prevent criminal activity. Improved awareness of dog thefts among the community will ensure more vigilance within neighbourhood watch and community alert areas. </p></reply>

Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in its functions. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided me with the following update on the Probate Office. </p>  <p>  County Registrars are responsible for the management of probate in District Probate Registries outside of Dublin and are independent in carrying out their functions. The Courts Service works closely with County Registrars to support their timely processing of applications. </p>  <p>  While there have been variations in the level of service that could be provided as a result of Covid-19 restrictions, I am assured that District Probate Registries continued to work at all times during the pandemic. As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of personal application interviews must be conducted in line with public health guidelines. As a result, the Courts Service advises that personal applications did have to be curtailed during Level 5 restrictions to ensure the safety of both the applicant and staff. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has confirmed that interviews for personal applications resumed in May and additional staff resources have been allocated in some locations to facilitate these interviews. </p>  <p>  The Dublin Probate Office accounts for over fifty per cent of all probate applications lodged in this jurisdiction, and the waiting time for solicitor applications is at its lowest point for many years. For applications that are correct, the waiting period is six weeks. In Cork, waiting times are 10-12 weeks for solicitors, and 14 weeks for personal applications compared to 10 weeks and 12 weeks respectively in November 2019.</p>  <p>  District Registries normally are small offices and I understand from the Courts Service that staff turnover can lead to temporary spikes in waiting times while vacancies are filled. However, the staff of the Probate Office are committed to clearing any backlogs and I am informed that personal application backlogs have reduced and waiting times have stabilised. I know that the Court Service is committed to continuing to resource this work to minimise waiting times as far as possible.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service also advises that the manual Revenue affidavit was removed from the probate process and replaced with an online system, which went live last September.  </p></reply>

This has enabled sustained, ongoing recruitment. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the general management and administration of the Garda organisation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. This includes the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State.  As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions. </p>  <p>  As at 30 April 2021 there were 74 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Macroom District, which represents an increase of 10.4% since 2015.  These Garda members are supported by 5 Garda staff.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, Garda numbers nationwide can be affected by a number of factors, including retirements, medical discharges and resignations. The impact of policing measures and other steps to support the public health restrictions has also, exceptionally, had an impact across the country over the past year. As such, there has been a decrease in the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to Macroom district from 77 Garda&iacute; in April 2020 to 74 in April 2021.</p>  <p>  However, recruitment which had to be paused due to the pandemic has recently recommenced with 150 Garda trainees entering the Garda College on 24 May, the first of four intakes and a planned total of 450 for the year. This continuing recruitment forms an important component in the unprecedented and sustained level of investment being made in Garda resources in recent years, and is equipping the organisation to meet community needs throughout the country.</p></reply>

My Department is in the final stages of developing an implementation plan which will set out changes to be made in all areas of civil justice, including litigation costs, case delays, and access to services and legal aid. Once completed, the implementation plan will be brought to Government and published. The extensive reforms proposed by former President Kelly will transform the experience of those seeking to access civil justice in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 has already brought greater transparency to how legal costs are charged. It obliges legal practitioners to provide more detailed information about legal costs to their clients. It has introduced statutory rules and limitations when advertising legal services, and enables legal services users to apply to the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator to have disputed legal costs adjudicated. Under the General Scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, which was approved by Cabinet this week, we are also facilitating the introduction of new legal partnerships, which will enable barristers and solicitors to jointly provide legal services for the first time, thereby offering a greater range of services and legal expertise to their clients.</p>  <p>  Building on that work, and the recommendations of the Kelly Review, the Justice Plan 2021 commits to commencing work to introduce new scales of legal costs which would be independently drawn up, in order to reduce legal costs and to provide greater certainty to the users of legal services in relation to cost. My Department has tendered for research bids to undertake an economic analysis of appropriate models and approaches.  </p>  <p>  A General Scheme of a Bill to create a specialist family court system, which is designed to help people get a quicker resolution of those most sensitive of family disputes, was published last year.  A public consultation has commenced on the first Family Justice Strategy.  </p>  <p>  For those who require direct State support to engage in litigation, especially family matters, my officials are currently working on the scope and nature of a review of the civil legal aid scheme. I intend to commence this review later in the year with a view to bringing forward proposals for reform.  Last Friday, I announced that the Legal Aid Board will no longer include the Housing Assistance Payment in their calculation of entitlement to civil legal aid.  This will have a positive impact for those who are of modest means and are in receipt of HAP or any other housing support measure provided by a Government Department or any other public body. </p>  <p>  My Department's Justice Plan 2021 also provides that a Mediation Council will be established and I expect this reform will support the ongoing development of the mediation profession as an accessible alternative to more costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.</p>  <p>  Finally, regulations for the use of Pre-Action Protocols in medical negligence cases are being finalised by Government &ndash; these reduce the costs of litigation by enabling parties to agree to how they will conduct their case between them.</p>  <p>  The range of actions I have outlined to the Deputy today have all been developed with the aim of reducing legal costs and enhancing citizen&rsquo;s experiences of accessing justice to resolve particular matters.</p></reply>

The Information Management and Technology (IM&amp;T) unit operates and monitors all relevant systems to the highest levels, and is closely engaged with colleagues in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to ensure that we follow best practice as it relates to all aspects of cyber security.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, for operational and security reasons, it is not the practice to disclose details of systems and processes as this could compromise those efforts. In particular, it is not considered appropriate to disclose information which might assist criminals to identify potential vulnerabilities in security arrangements. </p>  <p>  I can say that, over the last 7 years, my Department has made considerable enhancements to its ICT systems and services.  This includes migrating our technology infrastructure and completing a refresh of the major server and telecommunications components of the IT landscape. We also transitioned to a new managed service provider and since doing so have consistently delivered in excess of 99.5% system availability.  We have significantly expanded our use of OGCIO's 'build-to-share' applications to include eSubmissions, eFOI, ePQs, eCorrespondence and eDocs.  </p>  <p>  Dramatically increasing digital services through the justice sector to support our modernisation and reform agenda is a core priority of Justice Plan 2021. </p>  <p>  Earlier his year my Department recruited a specialist Chief Information Officer (CIO) at Assistant Secretary level to lead our team in the implementation of its IMT strategy which will see further enhancement of systems and increased digital transformation across our public facing services. This will include moving from our legacy case-management systems to more modern flexible platforms.</p>  <p>  I should add that since the introduction of GDPR and the Data Protection Act in 2018 which affords considerable protections to personal data, my Department has devoted significant resources to ensuring compliance with the requirements of that legislation.  A dedicated team, led by the Data Protection Officer, oversees all aspects of data protection on an ongoing basis and policies and procedures in relation to all aspects of data security are in place. </p></reply>

The purpose of the Scoping Report was to gather and assess information relating to ongoing challenges and community needs in Drogheda, and to identify actions to support communities and connect relevant services. </p>  <p>  The publication of the Scoping Report and the development of an implementation plan are key actions in Justice Plan 2021. A distinguished former Director of the Probation Service, Vivian Geiran, was engaged to prepare the report, which makes over 70 recommendations on short and long term responses to challenges the community faces. This includes measures around crime prevention, youth services, drug addiction, education, infrastructure and community development. The recommendations highlight the need for improved interagency cooperation in the administration and delivery of State services in Drogheda, as well as the need to resource public services or provide additional services in certain areas in particular.  </p>  <p>  The Scoping Report was published on 26 March last. Briefings were organised by Minister McEntee the following week for community groups and services that had met with Vivian Geiran, as well as for public representatives for Louth.</p>  <p>  The implementation plan for the key recommendations arising from the report is currently being developed and will identify the relevant stakeholders for each recommendation and outline next steps for engagement. I hope to bring the Implementation Plan to Government in the near future, and I look forward to continuing engagement with all relevant Departments, agencies and the Louth local authority to ensure a comprehensive and practical approach to implementation.</p>  <p>  As an example of this cooperation, early discussions have taken place with the Department of Education on the provision of additional supports to the schools identified in the report. Engagement has taken place at official level and I understand the Department of Education is positively disposed to providing additional supports to schools in the area, including those identified in the report. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be pleased to learn that discussions have also taken place with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding the impact on Drogheda of the intersection of the county boundaries of Louth and Meath.</p></reply>

Like him and many others, I would also hold the view that the perpetrators of this appalling atrocity should be brought to justice.</p>  <p>  Nearly 50 years ago, on 28 December 1972, bombs exploded in three border towns, Clones, Co. Monaghan, Belturbet, Co. Cavan and Pettigo, Co. Donegal. The perpetrators of these bombings demonstrated a callous disregard for human life with many injured and the lives of two innocent young people taken in the Belturbet bombing.</p>  <p>  I am assured that these bombings were comprehensively investigated at the time by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The investigation pursued various lines of inquiry; however it was not possible to acquire sufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed to me that the investigation remains open and their work has continued in the intervening period.  The Garda&iacute; also liaise with the families in relation to any developments.  Very regrettably, we have yet to see the perpetrators brought to justice. </p>  <p>  I would emphasise however that any new information will be assessed by the Garda authorities. In this regard, the content of the new material from recent academic and media sources has been brought to the attention of the Garda Commissioner for consideration and any appropriate action. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain committed to working closely with the PSNI as necessary, where that could advance the investigation.   I can also tell the Deputy that last month I took the opportunity to raise this bombing with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during my first week as Minister for Justice.  </p>  <p>  I would ask that anyone with information in relation to these appalling acts to please contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is never too late to do the right thing by these families who have suffered so much.  </p></reply>

Shane's death was a dreadful tragedy and a huge loss for his family and for his community.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a highly respected retired Judge, Gerard Haughton, has been conducting a scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding Shane O'Farrell's death.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of this exercise is to advise as to whether any further investigation or inquiry beyond those already carried out is necessary and if so to advise on the form of such investigation or inquiry and its terms of reference.</p>  <p>  Judge Haughton furnished an interim report to the then Minister for Justice in November 2019. In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  I am awaiting the final report and I expect to receive this from the Judge shortly. </p>  <p>  The Judge is naturally completely independent in his work, and I can neither intervene in nor seek to influence the outcome of  the scoping exercise. My Department continues to provide all necessary assistance to the Judge to enable him to complete his work. The previous extensions to the timescale requested by the Judge have, as he has stated to the family, been necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Judge's desire to be as comprehensive as possible in conducting the scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret that this process has taken significantly longer than any of us would like, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible. I understand that Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise. </p></reply>

This has enabled sustained, ongoing recruitment. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the general management and administration of the Garda organisation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. This includes the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State. As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions. </p>  <p>  I am informed that, as at 30 April 2021, there were 117 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Mallow District, which represents an increase of 18.2% since 2015. These Garda members are supported by 7 Garda staff.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, Garda numbers nationwide can be affected by a number of factors, including retirements, medical discharges and resignations. The impact of policing measures and other steps to support the public health restrictions has also, exceptionally, had an impact across the country over the past year. As such, there has been a decrease in the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to Mallow District from 125 Garda&iacute; in April 2020 to 117 in April 2021.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note, however, that recruitment, which had been paused, has now recommenced in 2021 with 150 Garda trainees entering the Garda College on 24 May, the first of four intakes and a revised planned total of 450 for the year. This forms an important component in the unprecedented and sustained level of investment being made in Garda resources in recent years, and is equipping the organisation to meet community needs throughout the country.</p></reply>

This is to provide a more comprehensive and inclusive policing service and will help strengthen the focus on Community Policing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a long tradition of community policing since its establishment almost 100 years ago. That said, the Government is committed to delivering on the report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI) which acknowledges that policing and community safety are not the sole responsibility of the Garda&iacute; but require a whole of Government approach. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department recently published the General Scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. This Bill will improve the performance and accountability of our policing and security services, and support the human rights of all people throughout Ireland to be and feel safe in their communities. It will represent the most wide ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation.</p>  <p>  The Bill has four main objectives: </p>  <p>1.  Make the prevention of harm and protection of people who are vulnerable or at risk, and the safety of communities, a &ldquo;whole of government&rdquo; responsibility, </p>  <p>2.  Strengthen and consolidate independent, external oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,</p>  <p>3.  Enhance the internal governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the role of the Garda Commissioner as CEO, and </p>  <p>4.  Improve the independent oversight of our national security infrastructure.</p>  <p>  This Bill has been developed on the basis of the recommendations of CoFPI following its fundamental in-depth review and builds on the work of the Policing Authority.</p>  <p>  The Commission found that community safety requires a whole of Government approach in partnership with local communities. My Department has been developing a new Community Safety Policy and this new policy will be given a statutory basis in the Bill. To support and inform the policy, three Local Community Safety Partnerships are being piloted in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, Waterford and Longford and will run for the next two years.  </p>  <p>  The pilots will inform the development of the rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area as part of the provisions of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. As the pilots will run for a period of two years, resources will be appropriated through the normal Budgetary process. </p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p><p>have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country. </p><p>Following approval by Government, my Department recently published the General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill.  The Bill will provide a comprehensive statutory underpinning for the use of digital recording equipment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner.  When enacted, this legislation will replace section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  I can confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021.</p><p>Last year the grant aid scheme was extended to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete.  Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.</p><p>Grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements. In other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant local authority (also acting as data controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from the Department of Justice website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>- and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address, <i>fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie</i>.  </p></reply>

The Justice Plan 2021 identifies the enactment of legislation to licence and regulate the gambling industry as a key objective.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, I expect to be in a position to publish the Scheme of the Bill in Q3 2021, and will seek Government approval for the drafting of the bill on that basis. My Department is targeting some key milestones in the year ahead. In addition to the publication of the general scheme, it is intended to finalise the appointment of a CEO designate by the end of the year. This is the clear path towards the regulator being fully operational in early 2023.  </p>  <p>  While a General Scheme of a Gambling Control Bill was published in 2013, a considerable amount of further work has been done in the meantime. The Inter-Departmental Working Group on Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling reported in 2019 and a European Commission funded report on the structure of a gambling regulator was produced in late 2019. The task now is to bring all three elements together, and having regard to the on-going evolution of the gambling industry, into one coherent scheme of a Bill that will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, given the size, complexity and technological development of the modern gambling industry and having regard to the current outdated and complex arrangements, it will be important that the regulator will be established on a sound footing and be adequately resourced to carry out this important task. </p></reply>

This must be a system in which the Garda&iacute; know where these offenders are living, and the offenders remain engaged with important, tailored risk-management and rehabilitative measures which are designed to lower the risk of the person committing further offences. </p>  <p>  In many cases, a person found guilty of a sexual offence automatically becomes subject to the registration/notification requirements of Part 2 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001. </p>  <p>  The sex offender is then obliged to notify the Garda&iacute; of their name and address for a period. Any change in address must also be notified to Garda&iacute; within a specified time. Failure to do so constitutes an offence.</p>  <p>  Both monitoring and breach of the notification requirements are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda National Protective Services Bureau has a dedicated unit, the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit, which has oversight and monitoring responsibility at national level for the management of registered sex offenders.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that as of May 26th this year, there are 1,706 people recorded at the Unit who are subject to Part 2 of the Sex Offenders Act. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that in 2020, 19 people were charged with 22 offences contrary to section 12 of the Act and this year to date, 6 people have been charged with 6 offences contrary to section 12 of the Act.</p>  <p>  While these figures indicate that there is high level of compliance with Part 2 orders, the Deputy is aware that work is ongoing to amend the existing legislation relating to the monitoring of sex offenders. </p>  <p>  The Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill will, among other things, strengthen and tighten the notification requirements for convicted sex offenders.</p>  <p>  At present a convicted sex offender has 7 days in which to notify Garda&iacute; of their place of residence or of a change in address. The new Bill proposes to reduce this to 3 days which will remove any delay in information provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will better facilitate the continuous monitoring of the movement of convicted sex offenders.  </p></reply>

The Justice Plan 2021 identifies the enactment of legislation to licence and regulate the gambling industry as a key objective.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, I expect to be in a position to publish the Scheme of the Bill in Q3 2021, and will seek Government approval for the drafting of the bill on that basis. My Department is targeting some key milestones in the year ahead. In addition to the publication of the general scheme, it is intended to finalise the appointment of a CEO designate by the end of the year. This is the clear path towards the regulator being fully operational in early 2023.  </p>  <p>  While a General Scheme of a Gambling Control Bill was published in 2013, a considerable amount of further work has been done in the meantime. The Inter-Departmental Working Group on Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling reported in 2019 and a European Commission funded report on the structure of a gambling regulator was produced in late 2019. The task now is to bring all three elements together, and having regard to the on-going evolution of the gambling industry, into one coherent scheme of a Bill that will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, given the size, complexity and technological development of the modern gambling industry and having regard to the current outdated and complex arrangements, it will be important that the regulator will be established on a sound footing and be adequately resourced to carry out this important task. </p></reply>

This will require a sustained commitment to working collaboratively and effectively between State agencies and community partners, as well as a commitment to prioritise resource allocation to address factors connected to early involvement in criminal activity and more serious offending patterns. </p>  <p>  The Strategy strengthens and expands the role of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) and promotes appropriate linkages and alignment with other community-based initiatives, including those supported by the Probation Service.  Bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime will support the objective of diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour. </p>  <p>  There are currently 105 GYDPs nationally and the intention is to further develop this service so that it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from it, through an ongoing expansion of existing services and the foundation of new projects where necessary. Funding for GYDPs has increased every year since 2015. &euro;15.3 million was provided in 2019 and at least &euro;15.6 million was provided for 2020. &euro;18 million funding has been provided for 2021 with a further allocation of &euro;3m for the Greentown pilots, Bail Supervision Scheme and Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice (REPPP). </p>  <p>  The Strategy also provides that, where necessary, GYDPs can provide a broader range of services, including family support and engagement with children aged 8-12 years, as well as developing enhanced approaches to engaging with harder to reach children and young people who may have more entrenched patterns of offending.</p>  <p>  The Youth Justice Strategy provides a framework to:</p>  <p>  - prevent offending behaviour occurring;</p>  <p>  - divert children and young adults who commit a crime away from further offending and involvement with the criminal justice system; and</p>  <p>  - enhance criminal justice processes, detention and post-detention measures, to provide consistent support to encourage desistance from crime and promote positive personal development for young offenders.</p>  <p>  The Youth Justice Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2027 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This Act ensures that our regulatory framework keeps pace with the increasing integration of financial flows in the internal market, the evolving trends, technological developments and the prevention of organised crime. In line with international standards adopted by FATF, and the EU's legislative framework, Ireland has developed a solid regulatory framework for preventing money laundering.  </p>  <p>  This Act strengthens existing legislation and contains a renewed focus on gatekeepers of financial systems. It ensures that there is increasing transparency by bringing further institutions within the scope of the Irish anti-money laundering regulatory framework and by combatting the use of new trends and technologies employed by criminals. </p>  <p>  Virtual assets have created new opportunities for money launderers, terrorist financiers and other criminals to launder their proceeds or finance their illicit activities. The ability to transact in virtual assets rapidly across borders allows criminals to move and store assets digitally, often outside the regulated financial system.  </p>  <p>  Virtual assets also allow for greater anonymity when compared to other more traditional financial services.   This anonymity can help to disguise the origin or destination of the assets, which can prevent virtual asset transactions from being adequately monitored, thus making it harder for reporting entities to identify suspicious activity.  In turn this creates a barrier to the detection and investigation of criminal activity utilising virtual assets by law enforcement agencies.</p>  <p>  It is these Money Laundering / Terrorist Financing risks that the Virtual Asset Service Provider registration and supervision regime created by the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021 is intended to mitigate.  Money Laundering / Terrorist Financing is continuously evolving, as criminals seek new ways to launder funds/finance terrorism as more and more traditional avenues are closed off. </p>  <p>  However, this regime seeks to ensure that the &ldquo;gatekeepers&rdquo;, such as the legal profession, estate agents, accountancy bodies, who allow virtual assets to be moved, exchanged and stored, are subject to the same Anti Money Laundering and Countering Terrorist Financing obligations as banks and traditional financial service providers. In framing this regime, this legislation seeks to address our EU obligations, as well as the international obligations that arise from our membership of FATF.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act gives effect to EU Directive 2017/1371 on the fight against fraud to the European Union&rsquo;s financial interests by means of criminal law. The Directive establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions with regard to combatting fraud and other illegal activities (corruption and money laundering) affecting the EU&rsquo;s financial interests.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Justice Plan for 2021, the fight against organised crime stretches beyond our borders and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with their international colleagues to break the networks of serious criminals and prevent them from inflicting misery in our communities.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly liaises and cooperates with their international policing and security partners, such as EUROPOL and INTERPOL. </p>  <p>  Of great importance in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is the role of the Financial Intelligence Unit in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is responsible for receiving suspicious transaction reports from designated persons and analysing them, so that it can be used to combat crime.</p>  <p>  International collaboration is also central to further developing our capacity to combat the exploitation of technology for cybercrime. As the Deputy may appreciate, cybercrime and cyber attacks know no borders and evolve at a rapid pace.  In the wake of the easing of travel restrictions across Europe, the recently published EU Strategy to tackle Organised Crime 2021-2025 and the 2022-2025 EU priorities for the fight against serious and organised crime through the European multi-disciplinary platform against criminal threats (EMPACT) are timely strategies as they set out the priorities, actions and targets to be achieved in the coming five years to put the EU on a stronger footing in the fight against organised crime.</p>  <p>  A number of commitments with regard to cyber security are included in the Programme for Government in order to take the necessary actions to protect Ireland against hacking, cybercrime, crypto-jacking, hacktivism, and cyber espionage. This includes building the capacity of the National Centre for Cyber Security, under the remit of my colleague, Minister Ryan, to protect the public and private sectors against cybercrime on foot of the capacity review currently underway. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is supporting the Centre through ongoing engagement at a senior level, as well as the secondment of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been significantly stepping up its dedicated resources in the cyber area in recent years, as is recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The Garda Commissioner established a dedicated National Bureau last summer, led by a Detective Chief Superintendent. The Bureau is expanding with planned increases of nearly 80 additional staff between this year and 2022, 25 of whom are already in place. This expansion will include recruitment of 20 civilian expert posts at engineer grade.  In addition, four regional cybercrime hubs in Galway, Cork, Mullingar and Wexford were established earlier this month. The bureau&rsquo;s own IT capability is also increasing with a new decryption suite procured earlier this year.  This work is also resourced through a team in the National Crime and Security Intelligence Service. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are liaising and co-operating with their international law enforcement partners &ndash; Interpol, Europol, the FBI and National Crime Agency.</p></reply>

Shane's death was a dreadful tragedy and a huge loss for his family and for his community.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a highly respected retired Judge, Gerard Haughton, has been conducting a scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding Shane O'Farrell's death.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of this exercise is to advise as to whether any further investigation or inquiry beyond those already carried out is necessary and if so to advise on the form of such investigation or inquiry and its terms of reference.</p>  <p>  Judge Haughton furnished an interim report to the then Minister for Justice in November 2019. In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  I am awaiting the final report and I expect to receive this from the Judge shortly. </p>  <p>  The Judge is naturally completely independent in his work, and I can neither intervene in nor seek to influence the outcome of  the scoping exercise. My Department continues to provide all necessary assistance to the Judge to enable him to complete his work. The previous extensions to the timescale requested by the Judge have, as he has stated to the family, been necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Judge's desire to be as comprehensive as possible in conducting the scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret that this process has taken significantly longer than any of us would like, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible. I understand that Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise. </p></reply>

The Bill will provide for a key principle from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone.  It will be best achieved as a &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; responsibility with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda&iacute; and the wider community working together.</p>  <p>  The new Bill will achieve this by establishing innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships to develop local safety plans tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves.  The Local Community Safety Partnerships will replace and build upon the existing joint policing committees and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns. </p>  <p>  Each Partnership will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, which will be informed by the community itself. Membership of the Partnerships will include: residents; community reps (including youth, new communities and voluntary sector); business and education reps; relevant public services including HSE, Tusla, Garda&iacute; and the local authority; and local councillors. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in November 2020, Minister McEntee announced the establishment of three new Local Community Safety Partnerships on a pilot basis in the north inner city of Dublin, Waterford and Longford. The locations of the pilots, which will run for 24 months, were chosen based on a number of factors including population density, crime rates and deprivation. An independent Chairperson will chair each Partnership pilot.</p>  <p>  As the pilots progress, they will be carefully evaluated and any necessary changes made to ensure the Partnerships work as effectively as possible for the communities involved. The pilots will inform the further development of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which will facilitate the rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area.</p></reply>

In line with this approach, Deportation Orders are being enforced only in circumstances where an individual may be a threat to national security or whose presence in Ireland would be contrary to the public interest.  </p>  <p>  With regard to legal proceedings, it is the case that individual immigration applicants may decide to seek a judicial review of an adverse decision made in their case.  Where such an application for judicial review is lodged, the Minister for Justice will typically be the respondent and will reserve the right to defend a lawfully made decision.  It will then be a matter for the courts to adjudicate on the lawfulness of the decision, which is the subject of the legal proceedings. </p>  <p>  The judicial review process is an important mechanism through which legal clarity and certainty can be brought to a particular immigration process or decision-making mechanism, and also through which important legal and administrative principles can be established, and reinforced, to guide future decision-making. </p>  <p>  In the context of the international protection process, the statutory provisions in this area are well defined and are clearly set out in the International Protection Act 2015. Any person seeking international protection status will have all aspects of their case considered in detail before a decision is made. Such a decision would involve the granting of international protection status, or the refusal of international protection status but the granting of a permission to remain, or the refusal of both international protection status and permission to remain. </p>  <p>  The issuing of letters recommending the refusal of international protection and permission to remain have been suspended since December and for the duration of Level 5 restrictions. The question of recommencing issuing these decisions will be kept under review in the coming weeks as the situation regarding international travel eases. </p>  <p>  Any person who has been refused international protection and permission to remain will be made aware of their right to exercise the option of voluntary return; where they fail to do so, a Deportation Order will be made. Any such decision to make a Deportation Order will only be made after a fair and comprehensive examination of the facts and circumstances of the individual case has been conducted, including in relation to their right to a private and a family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).</p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is open to a person subject to a Deportation Order to make a request, under section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), to have that order revoked. Any such request will need to be founded on new information or materially changed circumstances which have arisen since the decision to make the Deportation Order was taken. Any request will be considered on its individual merits.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, processing rates have been negatively impacted by the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed and we have been unable to hold in-person citizenship ceremonies since March 2020. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Covid-19 disruption, a High Court case, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, also resulted in significant delays and the loss of over six months&rsquo; processing time.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are just over 24,600 applications on hand. These applications are at various stages within the system, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made but it is not possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony. </p>  <p>  On 18 January 2021, we opened a temporary system that enables applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. Approximately 2,428 people have received their Irish citizenship since then.  A further 1,853 people have returned their signed statutory declarations and we will be sending them their certificates of naturalisation in the coming weeks.  By the end of this month, we will have communicated with 6,500 applicants, offering them the opportunity to complete their citizenship through the statutory declaration process. </p>  <p>  To further address the volume of applications on hand, we are assigning additional staff to the citizenship team; and we have introduced a number of measures to increase the digitisation of the process. This includes the introduction of eTax clearance and eVetting; rolling out online payments; revising our website to make it more user-friendly for customers; and launching our first chatbot &lsquo;Tara&rsquo;, which has answered more than 12,000 customer queries since November. </p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up additional resources to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  Under normal circumstances, passports are returned approximately 10 days after their receipt.  However, the current limits on staff attendance in the office due to COVID-19 restrictions, has resulted in delays in the return of some passports. </p>  <p>  Applicants are advised not to send in their application during the pandemic if they anticipate that they may have to travel at short notice. However, I fully appreciate that people may have to travel at short notice for emergency reasons.  The citizenship website advises that in these circumstances, applicants should email the citizenship helpdesk (citizenshipinfo@justice.ie) with the relevant details including postal tracking reference if available. The request must be accompanied by appropriate scanned supporting material detailing the reasons for travel. Any request of this nature is dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions. Furthermore, the scheduling of individual court cases and the allocation of court business are matters for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. </p>  <p>  Last year, the Courts Service adopted a Modernisation Programme aimed at improving access to justice in a modern, digital Ireland.  This programme sets the agenda for reform over the coming years with a digital first user-centric approach at its core, and is overseen by a dedicated Modernisation Programme sub-committee of the Courts Service Board. As part of the initial phase of the programme, a framework is being developed which will track and measure progress throughout the programme&rsquo;s implementation.</p>  <p>  I particularly welcome the goal of the Courts Service, as set out in its recently published Corporate Strategic Plan 2021 &ndash; 2023, to maximise the use of digital technologies to provide an improved and user-centred service. </p>  <p>The Courts Service and the judiciary have adapted with innovation and speed during the pandemic and many of the practices introduced due to Covid-19, such as the increased use of video links and e-filing, point the way towards a Digital First future for the Courts Service. </p>  <p>  Remote court hearings have been an innovative feature of the response by the judiciary, County Registrars and the Courts Service to the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service recently announced a programme of courtroom technology expansion. This programme will deliver 49 new or upgraded video courtrooms throughout 2021, at a cost in excess of &euro;2.2 million, with 18 delivered to date. In 2015, there were just 26 video link enabled courtrooms. Since then, this number expanded to 65 last year, and will reach 104 courtrooms by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Between April 2020 and April 2021, a total of 4,917 remote court sessions were held. Over the same period, there were 16,995 Irish Prison Service remote video-link courtroom appearances by prisoners compared to 3,798 in 2019. </p>  <p>  This progress has been supported by the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring adequate resources for the courts and maintaining access to justice for all citizens. This year the Government agreed the highest ever budgetary allocation for the justice sector including &euro;158.8 million for the Courts Service. This included &euro;8 million for the Courts Modernisation Programme along with an additional provision of &euro;5.7m for COVID measures to enable court sittings take place in a socially distanced and safe environment.</p></reply>

Like him and many others, I would also hold the view that the perpetrators of this appalling atrocity should be brought to justice.</p>  <p>  Nearly 50 years ago, on 28 December 1972, bombs exploded in three border towns, Clones, Co. Monaghan, Belturbet, Co. Cavan and Pettigo, Co. Donegal. The perpetrators of these bombings demonstrated a callous disregard for human life with many injured and the lives of two innocent young people taken in the Belturbet bombing.</p>  <p>  I am assured that these bombings were comprehensively investigated at the time by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The investigation pursued various lines of inquiry; however it was not possible to acquire sufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed to me that the investigation remains open and their work has continued in the intervening period.  The Garda&iacute; also liaise with the families in relation to any developments.  Very regrettably, we have yet to see the perpetrators brought to justice. </p>  <p>  I would emphasise however that any new information will be assessed by the Garda authorities. In this regard, the content of the new material from recent academic and media sources has been brought to the attention of the Garda Commissioner for consideration and any appropriate action. This includes the academic article referred to by the Deputy in Parliamentary Question No. 464 of 15 December 2020.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain committed to working closely with the PSNI as necessary, where that could advance the investigation.   I can also tell the Deputy that last month I took the opportunity to raise this bombing with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during my first week as Minister for Justice.  </p>  <p>  I would ask that anyone with information in relation to these appalling acts to please contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is never too late to do the right thing by these families who have suffered so much.  </p></reply>

This has enabled sustained, ongoing recruitment. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the general management and administration of the Garda organisation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. This includes the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State.

These Garda members are supported by 45 Garda staff.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, Garda numbers can be affected by a number of factors, including retirements, medical discharges and resignations. The impact of policing measures and other steps to support the public health restrictions has also, exceptionally, had an impact over the past year. As such, there has been a decrease in the numbers of Garda&iacute; assigned to Bandon District from 113 in April 2020 to 104 in April 2021 and to Bantry Distict from 56 in April 2020 to 54 in April 2021.   There has been an increase in the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Clonakilty District over the same time period from 67 to 72.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note, however, that recruitment, which had been paused, has now recommenced in 2021 with 150 Garda trainees entering the Garda College on 24 May, the first of four intakes and a revised planned total of 450 for the year.  This forms an important component in the unprecedented and sustained level of investment being made in Garda resources in recent years, and is equipping the organisation to meet community needs throughout the country.</p></reply>

Interviews for personal applications, however, resumed early last month with additional resources being allocated to facilitating these interviews.  The staff of the Probate Office are committed to clearing the backlogs that had developed while personal applicant interviews were not possible and are working hard to achieve this. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that all such personal application interviews are required to be conducted in line with current Public Health Guidelines, which must be factored into the scheduling of interview appointments. </p><p>The waiting time for solicitor applications in the Dublin Office is at its lowest point for many years.

Shane's death was a dreadful tragedy and a huge loss for his family and for his community.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a highly respected retired Judge, Gerard Haughton, has been conducting a scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding Shane O'Farrell's death.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of this exercise is to advise as to whether any further investigation or inquiry beyond those already carried out is necessary and if so to advise on the form of such investigation or inquiry and its terms of reference.</p>  <p>  Judge Haughton furnished an interim report to the then Minister for Justice in November 2019. In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  I am awaiting the final report and I expect to receive this from the Judge shortly. </p>  <p>  The Judge is naturally completely independent in his work, and I can neither intervene in nor seek to influence the outcome of  the scoping exercise. My Department continues to provide all necessary assistance to the Judge to enable him to complete his work. The previous extensions to the timescale requested by the Judge have, as he has stated to the family, been necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Judge's desire to be as comprehensive as possible in conducting the scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret that this process has taken significantly longer than any of us would like, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible. I understand that Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise. </p></reply>

I am further informed that the OPW has adopted a very thorough approach to this project and a great deal of background work has been undertaken by the OPW, including technical appraisals, investigations and experimental repairs. Due to the size, complexity and anticipated high cost of the project, the actual restoration work will be undertaken in stages and as funding allows. The first phase of the restoration works will see ten of the 66 bays/sections restored. </p><p>The Courts Service further advises me that the OPW is managing a competitive procurement process to select a contractor with the necessary expertise and skills to undertake the phase 1 restoration. An invitation to tender for the restoration of the initial ten sections issued earlier in the year with a closing date of 26 March 2021. I understand that responses received are being evaluated at present and it is expected that a contract will be awarded shortly. Funding has been allocated in 2021 to cover the anticipated cost of the phase 1 restoration of the initial ten sections.

As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has significantly stepped up its dedicated resources in the cyber area in recent years and is continuing to grow its capabilities in this area. The Garda Commissioner established a dedicated Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB) last summer, led by a Detective Chief Superintendent. </p><p>GNCCB is responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of cybercrime incidents in the State. Cybercrime generally involves incidents where the internet, information and communication technology (ICT) systems or digital devices play a significant role in the commission of a criminal offence. GNCCB works collaboratively with local and national Garda units along with national and international stakeholders to reduce the threat and impact of cybercrime on individuals and organisations.</p><p>GNCCB is now in expansion phase, with increases of nearly 80 additional staff planned between this year and 2022, with 25 of these already in place. I am advised that this expansion of GNCCB will include the recruitment of 20 civilian expert posts at engineer grade.  </p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that on 12 April 2021, 25 additional sworn Garda members were allocated to GNCCB, comprising 4 Detective Sergeants and 21 Detective Garda&iacute;. 15 of these Garda members were allocated to Cyber Satellite Hubs based in Cork, Galway, Mullingar &amp;amp; Wexford, whilst the remaining 9 were allocated to the National Cybercrime Unit based in Harcourt Square. </p><p>I am advised by Garda authorities that total staffing levels in GNCCB stand at 45 Garda members and 6 Garda staff. I am advised that it is anticipated that a further allocation of staff to GNCCB will occur in the near future.</p><p>I am also advised that GNCCB&rsquo;s own IT capability is also increasing, with a new decryption suite procured earlier this year. This work is also resourced through a smaller expert team in the National Crime and Security Intelligence Service.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains strong international links and is liaising and co-operating with international law enforcement and security partners &ndash; Interpol, Europol, the FBI and the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency.</p><p>A breakdown of the number of Garda members assigned to the unit is provided in the table below.</p><p><b>The current staffing levels at the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>2021 </th>       <th>D/Chief Supt</th>       <th>D/Supt</th>       <th>D/Insp</th>       <th>D/Sgt</th>       <th>D/Garda</th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Harcourt Square</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>29</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork Hub</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>1</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford Hub</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mullingar Hub</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway Hub</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>45</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This has enabled sustained, ongoing recruitment. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the general management and administration of the Garda organisation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. This includes the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State.  As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions. </p>  <p>  As of 30 April 2021 there were 123 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Midleton District, which represents an increase of 7.9% since 2015. As of the same date, there were 103 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Fermoy District, which represents an increase of 21.2% since 2015.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Fermoy District from 98 Garda&iacute; in April 2020 to 103 in April 2021, which is an overall increase of 5.1%.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, Garda numbers can be affected by a number of factors, including retirements, medical discharges and resignations.  The impact of policing measures and other steps to support the public health restrictions has also, exceptionally, had an impact over the past year. There has been a decrease in the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Midleton District from 134 Garda&iacute; in April 2020 to 123 in April 2021. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note, however, that recruitment, which had been paused, has now recommenced in 2021 with 150 Garda trainees entering the Garda College on 24 May, the first of four intakes and a revised planned total of 450 for the year.  This continuing recruitment forms an important component in the unprecedented and sustained level of investment being made in Garda resources in recent years, and is equipping the organisation to meet community needs throughout the country.</p></reply>

I am informed that there is ongoing liaison with community leaders and schools to discourage anti-social behaviour, along with engagement with residents associations and communities to drive a partnership response to issues. </p><p>My Department's Justice Plan 2021 contains a number of commitments with regard to tackling anti-social behaviour.  </p><p>In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have established a special expert forum on antisocial behaviour. A subgroup of this forum has already helped inform a new scheme to tackle the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes and similar sub groups can also be established for other issues where appropriate.</p><p>On 15 April last, Minister McEntee and I also launched the new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This new strategy will respond collaboratively to the situation of vulnerable children and young people, with a strong focus on diverting them away from offending, and building supports to provide prevention and early intervention.</p><p>The Strategy will seek to increase the range and quality of supports available to support positive personal development and behavioural change to lead to positive outcomes for the young people involved and their families.</p><p>This will be achieved through strengthening and enhancing the supports provided through the existing network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) around the country. The geographical coverage of the service will be expanded so that, within two years, it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from it. In particular, GYDP services will be enhanced to provide:</p><p>- early intervention and engagement with more challenging children and young people whose needs may be too complex for the existing GYDP services;</p><p>- family support;</p><p>- engagement with younger children (8-11 years); and</p><p>- support to schools in relation to the retention of young people with challenging behaviour in the education system.</p><p>While Garda Youth Diversion Projects primarily receive referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they may receive referrals from other sources including schools, parents or self-referrals.</p><p>Anti-social behaviour will also be considered by the local community safety partnerships which are to be set up in every local authority under my Department&rsquo;s new community safety policy. Three pilot partnerships are currently being established in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, Longford and Waterford and will run for the next two years, ahead of the nationwide rollout.</p></reply>

As a result of this work, I have recently approved the following measures.</p>  <p>  My officials will write to each coroner to ask them what cases of unidentified remains they have dealt with since 2019. </p>  <p>  Additionally, a new question on unidentified remains will be added to the annual statistical return from coroners, as provided for under Section 55 of the Coroners Act 1962.</p>  <p>  The results of the number of cases identified in each coronial district will be shared with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in particular their Missing Persons Unit.  This will provide an overview of the current situation since 2019 across the country along with an ongoing annual update on any new cases each year to permit An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to follow up with the individual coroners.  </p>  <p>  Forensic Science Ireland assists in the identification of human remains through the National DNA Database. Forensic Science Ireland and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have worked in partnership over the past number of years to deliver a DNA testing facility for families of missing persons at the national Missing Persons Day ceremony. This partnership has served to enhance the ceremony from that of a largely commemorative event to one which has contributed to raising awareness of the significant contribution made by DNA testing to the conclusion of a considerable number of missing persons cases over recent years. </p>  <p>  I hope that the promotion of the proposed work on recording unidentified remains, and in particular the annual return from coroners, will encourage more family members of missing persons to participate in DNA testing and database matching. To encourage this greater engagement, my officials will develop a targeted communications and outreach campaign, in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Forensic Science Ireland, to build on the success of National Missing Persons Day and encourage families to participate in this process.</p></reply>

The National Planning Framework sets out in detail our vision for our rural areas, towns and cities. The revised National Development Plan that the Government is currently developing is a further opportunity to deliver on this vision. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the development of a &lsquo;Town Centre First&rsquo; policy focused on regeneration of rural towns and villages, and my Department&rsquo;s Retail Forum developed a Framework for Town Centre Renewal which is a useful tool to assist Town Teams in how to improve footfall and customer experience in their towns. We are implementing a strategic approach to town centre regeneration, with the aim of utilising existing buildings and unused lands for new development and promoting residential occupancy in our rural towns and villages, using the National Planning Framework as our guide.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department published the National Remote Work Strategy in January 2021. The Strategy aims to ensure remote work is a permanent feature in our workplaces in a way that maximises economic, social, and environmental benefits across regions. We are aware that the impacts of remote work can be substantial and can fundamentally change the nature of where, how, when, and why we work. Earlier this week the Government launched 'ConnectedHubs.ie'. This shared remote working platform will offer a booking system for employees, entrepreneurs and enterprises. It will provide people with the opportunity to reserve facilities, including hot desks and meeting rooms, at hubs across Ireland. </p>  <p>  Overseen by my Department, nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 are currently being developed by regional stakeholders which will identify growth opportunities, recognise vulnerabilities, and enable job creation across the regions.  These plans reinforce and build on the core activities of the IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) and the wider range of State bodies involved in supporting regional enterprise development. Each Plan is overseen by a Regional Steering Committee chaired by a senior level businessperson. My Departmental colleagues, Minister Robert Troy and Minister Damien English are driving the delivery of the new Plans nationally. The new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 are expected to be completed in Quarter 3 this year.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided funding to assist regional enterprise development and jobs growth. For example, my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund and Border Fund have allocated over &euro;117 million across 79 enterprise strengthening projects in every region over a series of competitive calls since 2017 through Enterprise Ireland. These Funds are supporting significant collaborative and innovative regional projects that, when complete, will provide a timely impetus to job creation in regional locations.</p>  <p>  Looking at employment growth, almost two thirds of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2020 were in regions outside of Dublin while IDA Ireland created 10,082 new jobs outside of Dublin. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy 2021-2024 targets half of FDI investments overall as going to regions outside of Dublin. </p></reply>

The report is built on three pillars which are bolstered by underpinning conditions. These pillars are:</p><p>1. Create a Conducive Environment </p><p>2. Develop and Leverage a Remote Work Infrastructure</p><p>3. Build a Remote Work Policy and Guidance Framework </p><p>Under these pillars and the underpinning conditions there are 15 actions to progress remote working into the future. The Strategy outlines the Departments and State Agencies responsible for the delivery of each of the actions. Each of these actions has a deadline of Q1, 3, or 4 of this year. </p><p>My Department is leading on the implementation of the Strategy. Lead actors report the progress on their actions to the Interdepartmental Group on Remote Work. This Group has met twice to date this year, with the most recent meeting taking place last week, on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  At this meeting it was established that actions to date have been met and that progress is underway to achieving the remaining actions by the end of the year. The Group will continue to meet as the year progresses to drive the implementation of the Strategy. </p></reply>

This commitment is being given effect under Action 19 of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Insurance Reform. </p>  <p>  PIAB offers the most cost-effective and efficient settlement channel for personal injury claims. However, the number of cases being finalised through PIAB has fallen in recent years. </p>  <p>  As Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, I have met regularly with PIAB and a range of representative bodies to assess the role of PIAB and develop proposals for the reform of the agency. I have undertaken a public consultation seeking views on the matter from all interested parties. There has been very good engagement with the consultation and we are now concluding the examination of the responses with a view to introducing legislation to enhance and reform PIAB. The overarching objective of the proposed reforms is to bring more cases within PIAB&rsquo;s ambit and reduce the number of cases that PIAB release to litigation.</p>  <p>  We have already seen significant changes in the operations of PIAB during this year which are intended to enhance its role. Following adoption by the Judicial Council, new Personal Injuries Guidelines came into effect in Ireland on the 24th April and these Guidelines apply to all cases assessed by PIAB from that date.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Minister for Justice and I, published the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Bill 2021 in April 2021. This Bill will bring Garda compensation claims within the PIAB process. This will benefit both claimants, in terms of quicker resolution of claims with an objective assessment of quantum, and the State as the respondent, in terms of lower legal and administrative costs.</p>  <p>  I am confident that through the reform and enhancement of PIAB we will help to reduce the cost of personal injury claims and increase the affordability and availability of insurance.</p></reply>

This strategy positions IDA to respond to the emerging trends that are accelerating as a result of the Covid-19 global pandemic. The new strategy will be delivered through a focus on five pillars: Growth, Transformation, Regions, Sustainability and Impact.</p><p>Regional development is at the centre of IDA&rsquo;s new strategy. IDA is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. We will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country.</p><p>There are 211 IDA client companies in the South-West region, employing 46,009 people. The FDI performance in the region has been strong over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing by 30%. IDA will target 118 investments<b></b>for the South-West region in the period 2021-2024.</p><p>Counties in the South-West also benefit hugely from the direct and indirect employment generated by IDA client companies located in the South West.  The South-West has a significant ecosystem of well-established companies across Technology, Life Sciences, International Financial Services and Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies.</p><p>A key driver of FDI in the South-West is the city of Cork, the development of which the NPF recognises as critical to enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s metropolitan profile. MNCs across the region are supported by industry focused third level institutions and internationally renowned research centres including University College Cork, Cork Institute of Technology (CIT), IT Tralee (ITT), the Tyndall Institute and a number of SFI Research Centres. The establishment of Munster Technological University (MTU) on January 1st 2021, through the merger of CIT and ITT, will further strengthen the South West&rsquo;s value proposition to FDI. The presence of Cork Airport in the South-West is a key asset to the region in attracting and maintaining FDI. </p><p>During the period of the last strategy, IDA delivered an Advanced Building Solution in Tralee, and undertook significant upgrade work on our Business &amp;amp; Technology Parks in Cork, Killarney, Carrigtwohill and Mallow. IDA also invested in strategic infrastructure at Ringaskiddy in Cork.</p><p>IDA will deliver an Advanced Building Solution in Tralee over 2021-2024, while continuing to work closely with the private sector in the South-West to secure the provision of appropriate and cost-effective building and property solutions for client companies. Additional upgrade works, and investment are planned for IDA Parks in the region to ensure a robust value proposition for clients, and IDA plans to acquire additional strategic sites for future development.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to facilitate additional liquidity to SMEs, primary producers and Small Mid-Caps (i.e. companies with fewer than 500 employees). It has given certainty to the lending market that funding is available and operates in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary Framework for State Aid. This Framework has facilitated the speedy introduction of the CCGS but it also has eligibility criteria for the loans that must be met. These include the basis of the size of the loan based on turnover or staff wages and the requirement that the business must show potential future viability.</p>  <p>The CCGS was launched on the 7th of September last with AIB, BOI and Ulster Bank being the initial finance providers. All finance providers are required to demonstrate reduced interest rates to the participating business and there is no requirement for collateral or personal guarantees for loans up to &euro;250,000. Finance providers utilise their own credit departments to assess future viability. They have the widest branch networks in the country and are closest to the businesses to determine this. </p>  <p>  While there is a normal processing time between applications and drawdown, figures from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, who operate the CCGS on behalf of the government, show a steady increase in the number of loans and total weekly lending. Furthermore, new lenders have been successful in their application to operate loans under the CCGS, including a range of Credit Unions who are at the final stages of their legal agreements and operational set up. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Microfinance Ireland, it operates its own loan book and is not a participant in any credit guarantee scheme. Owners of micro businesses with less than 10 employees can go directly to Microfinance Ireland or access their loans through the 32 Local Enterprise Offices. Currently, Microfinance Ireland are offering a COVID Business Loan, A Brexit Business Loan and their standard loans. </p>  <p>  Finally, the CCGS is part of a suite of loans available to Irish businesses which includes the Brexit Loan Scheme and the Future Growth Loan Scheme. More widely, government has provided grants, rebates and employee assistances available to Irish business owners. </p></reply>

There are 85 IDA supported companies in the sector in Ireland employing over 37,000 people.</p>  <p>  Pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in Ireland play a key role in the global supply chain of numerous innovative medicines used to treat a wide range of illnesses. The continued necessity and demand for these medicines remains critical to patient care, and sites in Ireland have remained focused on maintaining operations and supply of these vital medicines. The capabilities of each site are specifically developed for the production of those medicines while ensuring regulatory and safety performance. </p>  <p>  The manufacture of medicinal products, including vaccines, is a complex activity that involves multiple production stages and manufacturing processes, specialist expertise, specific technology solutions and associated infrastructure and a well-coordinated global supply chain. The bulk of global manufacturing to date has been in dedicated vaccine production sites. Modification of an existing facility to manufacture a new product such as a vaccine, would require significant time and capital expenditure and a comprehensive regulatory assessment and is therefore not practical to meet the demands of speed and scale that are required to tackle the pandemic.</p>  <p>  We have an ongoing commitment to this critical sector and support innovative companies that are developing the new products and processes that will further develop the industry here in Ireland and help us in the fight against COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Products Scheme launched in June 2020 allows additional aid to companies that are developing or producing medicinal products and equipment used in the fight against COVID-19. To date, proposals in response to the fight against COVID-19 have included investments in the area of ventilators, PPE, diagnostics test kits and building capacity for testing and scaling of therapeutics. To-date IDA has approved seven proposals with a combined capital expenditure of &euro;2 million and related grant approval of &euro;7.1 million. Grant draw down in 2020 was in the amount of &euro;2 million.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, a global client of IDA announced plans to manufacture a COVID -19 vaccine drug substance at its facility in Dublin. Expansion plans at this site will allow for the extra production that will be part of the global vaccine supply chain network, contributing to the worldwide supply of the vaccine. This represents a vote of confidence in the Irish life-sciences sector.</p></reply>

Since the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into force, there has been some short-term disruption arising from the new requirements around customs and SPS checks and controls. Businesses are however gradually adjusting to the new trading realities, finding alternative supply chains and are being encouraged to find new markets for their products. </p>  <p>  The most recent CSO statistical data release indicates that the value of goods exports to Great Britain in the first quarter of 2021 was &euro;3,033 million, a decrease of &euro;82 million (-3%) on the first quarter of 2020. However, exports to Great Britain increased by &euro;139 million (+13%) to &euro;1,216 million in March 2021 compared with March 2020. Exports to Great Britain accounted for 8% of total exports. The value of goods imports from Great Britain for January to March 2021 was &euro;2,204 million, a decrease of &euro;2,002 million (-48%) compared with January to March 2020.</p>  <p>  It is too early, based on statistics for the first quarter of 2021, to get a real sense of the impact that Brexit will have on longer term trade flows as there are other contributory factors, not least COVID-19 that has also had a chilling economic effect. Analysis of trade flows over a longer period of time would be required to allow for sound conclusions to be drawn. </p>  <p>  Since January 2021, Enterprise Ireland has engaged with client companies through surveys and focus groups to understand the impacts for companies on the new trading relationship with the UK. Companies across all sectors identified common challenges such as the potential disruption from Import Checks which are set to begin in October; supplier issues and transport and logistics; and  general competitiveness of businesses because Brexit &ndash; related customs procedures and added supply chain costs have increased the costs to businesses.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the new business challenges, the UK continues to be a strategic market of importance for Irish companies. A recent survey of Enterprise Ireland clients currently operating in the UK market reported that 89 percent see future opportunities in the UK while 83 percent report that their strategy is to grow exports to the UK.</p>  <p>  While Enterprise Ireland clients are continuing to diversify their export markets, the UK market remains the largest export market for Enterprise Ireland clients. In 2019, Enterprise Ireland clients reported &euro;7.9 billion in exports to the UK, representing 31 per cent of total client exports.  Enterprise Ireland remains committed to working with client companies to assist them sustain and grow their business, both in the UK, and through market diversification. This will be delivered through a comprehensive programme of funding, advice and in-market supports to get customs ready, remain competitive in the UK and identify future growth opportunities. </p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to ensuring that the most Brexit impacted sectors of the economy will be supported and assisted. The Deputy will be aware that economic analysis carried out in 2018, updated in January 2020, on the economic impacts of Brexit on the Irish economy, identified the Agri-Food sector as the one most likely to be most seriously impacted. In that respect, the &euro;100 million Capital Investment Scheme for the Processing and Marketing of Agricultural Products, managed by Enterprise Ireland, is just one of the ways the Government is helping the Agri-Food sector manage the fallout from Brexit.</p>  <p>  The EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve and the proposed significant allocation of funding to Ireland under this fund is strong recognition of the fact that Ireland is one of the most impacted Member States by Brexit. The fund will be used to mitigate the worst impacts of Brexit for the most impacted sectors in the economy.</p></reply>

The introduction of travel restrictions has disrupted the way in which IDA Ireland engages with investors, resulting in fewer site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.  Nevertheless, IDA Ireland's results for 2020 demonstrated the ongoing resilience of our FDI base. IDA Ireland secured 246 investments in 2020, 128 of which were outside Dublin. 95 new name companies invested in Ireland for the first time. </p>  <p>  The second significant challenge which we have faced is Brexit. IDA Ireland has been working hard with its client base to help mitigate Brexit-related risks that could impact on foreign direct investment in Ireland.  The Agency has consistently sought out opportunities to attract further Brexit-related investment to Ireland, resulting in 95 Brexit-related investments with an associated jobs potential of 5,900. Furthermore, IDA Ireland has taken steps to diversify its source markets for foreign direct investment, restructuring its European operations to treat the UK as a separate market. It will also deploy additional resources in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.</p>  <p>  We recognise that the global competition for FDI is intensifying and that we will have to fight, harder than ever before, for new investment projects. IDA Ireland's new strategy will guide its response to these challenges. The Strategy is built on the five pillars of Regions, Growth, Transformation, Sustainability and Impact, and it has an ambitious set of targets including 800 investments and 50,000 new jobs. </p>  <p>  Overseas companies continue to value our FDI strengths. These include our talented and flexible work-force, a track record as a successful home to global businesses, and a hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction. Our continued commitment to the European Union, the single market and Eurozone, as well as to free trade and multilateralism, are other key selling points that help us convince multinational companies to establish operations and create jobs here.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that multinationals will continue to locate or expand further in Ireland in the years ahead.</p></reply>

From time-to-time IDA seeks to expand its global network of offices and teams. Many firms are looking to expand into new markets and Ireland is a proven location for global companies to grow and serve their customer base in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has decided to tender for a part-time Israel based Business Development Consultant.  This person will represent IDA to support its efforts to win new investment. This is a model used across many territories. The Business Development Consultant will be expected to identify Israeli-headquartered target companies with potential for investing in Ireland, engage with senior decision-makers in these companies and present Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition as an investment location.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is represented on the Implementation Group for the National Plan on Business and Human Rights; this is a multi-stakeholder group, comprising government, business and civil society representatives. The Implementation Group has drawn up Guidance on Business and Human Rights for Business Enterprises which was formally launched by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in April. IDA Ireland has advised my Department that they will be guided by all aspects of this guidance when appointing a business development consultant in any territory. </p>  <p>  As an Agency of my Department, I expect IDA Ireland to align with Ireland's well-known position on the illegality of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, which informs our engagement with the State of Israel across a range of bilateral issues, including trade. Ireland distinguishes between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967. </p>  <p>  UN Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted on 23 December 2016, calls on all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967. This Resolution reflected the position already held by Ireland, the EU and the UN for many years.</p>  <p>  Ireland consistently raises human rights issues in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory at the highest international levels, including most recently at the 46th session of the UN Human Rights Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains steadfast in its support for a comprehensive two state solution which protects the future of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.</p></reply>

This suspension has recently been extended to 30th September 2021.</p>  <p>  This was a difficult decision, and I am aware that many employees are experiencing uncertainty and want their employment position regularised.</p>  <p>  However, the public health situation is not yet resolved and restrictions are being eased on a gradual basis. Many businesses will continue to be impacted by restrictions for some period of time as the economy re-opens.</p>  <p>  Reinstating the entitlement for employees to claim redundancy before the end of September 2021 would have a serious impact on the potential for a business to recover and push many into insolvency situations, exacerbate employment losses and delay economic recovery.</p>  <p>  This further extension to 30th September 2021 will afford businesses some time to recover and provide them with some breathing space to consider their financial position and assess their future staffing requirements as the economy gradually re-opens.</p>  <p>  The extension is also important for employees to ensure that they have a continued link to their job and a pathway to return. The Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme have also been extended from the end of June to support affected employees.</p>  <p>  All other redundancy provisions remain unchanged and in force. If an employer is going to make an employee redundant, protections such as notice periods for redundancy and the payment of a redundancy lump-sum to the affected employee still apply and the existing suite of employment rights legislation remains in place. </p></reply>

The system is managed through the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists, which are subject to twice yearly evidence-based review. </p>  <p>  The Critical Skills Employment Permit (CSEP) is Ireland&rsquo;s premium permit. It is designed to attract highly skilled people into the labour market in roles identified as being in critical short supply (on the critical skilled occupation list) with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence and employment in the State.  As a result, it attracts a number of additional benefits over other permit types. These include an option to apply for long term residency permission after two years on a CSEP, immediate family reunification and for broad access to the labour market for dependents, spouses/partners of CSEP holders. </p>  <p>  The General Employment Permit (GEP) is the main permit used by the State to attract non-EEA nationals in occupations of a more general nature. It requires a range of criteria be met including a labour market needs test (LMNT) demonstrating that the employer was unable to fill the position from the Irish and EEA labour markets. After one year on a GEP the permit holder may apply for family reunification and after five years, long term residency permission from the Department of Justice.  In addition, non EEA nationals who have resided in the State for five years are eligible to apply for citizenship. </p>  <p>  All employment permit holders have exactly the same protections under Irish employment law as any other worker in the State and many of the criteria associated with the employment permits system are aimed at ensuring that migrant employees are treated in line with Irish labour laws.  </p>  <p>  The additional benefits attached to the CSEP are designed to attract workers in possession of skills of critical importance to the economy and to encourage them to apply for long term residency.</p>  <p>  Extending these additonal benefits to other employment permit holders would require consideration of the potential impacts, including on the domestic labour market, our community preference obligations to the EU and on broader immigration policies. My officials continue to engage on an ongoing basis on range of matters where economic migration polices and immigraton polices intersect including those issues raised by the deputy. </p></reply>

I am aware of the genuine concerns of social media content moderators both from meeting directly with them and from their recent presentation to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>  <p>  Ireland has in place a strong and robust legislative regime to protect all workers in terms of their working conditions, including work-related health and safety, as well as their terms and conditions of employment. The work of a social media moderator involves exposure to potentially harmful material the impact of which is a potential hazard to the worker. It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to identify, control and reduce impact of workplace hazards. </p>  <p>  Social media content moderators should be treated by an employer in the same way as any other worker potentially exposed to work related hazards. The employer must carry out a robust risk assessment with a particular focus on the potential hazards arising from work activities and must provide appropriate training. Where a particular hazard is identified that requires subsequent monitoring it must be included in the written Safety Statement, and the relevant worker must be made aware of the hazard and the associated monitoring that is in place.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the independent regulator for workplace safety. I am aware that the HSA is engaging with the Social Media sector to establish and assess the control measures in place to address the risks arising from specific nature of the work of content moderators. The HSA will be able to determine whether further advice or guidance is necessary for employers to ensure compliance with their duties under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that there is provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, to ensure that an employer cannot penalise, or threaten to penalise, an employee who makes a complaint or a representation on any matter relating to health and safety at work. Any worker concerned for their health and safety can contact the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s Workplace Contact Unit in confidence at wcu@hsa.ie.</p>  <p>  In addition, the services of the Workplace Relations Commission are available to anyone with a concern about their employment rights. In Ireland, we have a full suite of employment rights legislation which protects all workers legally employed on a contract of service basis. The WRC can be contacted at www.workplacerelations.ie.</p>  <p>  Separately, I would add that my colleague, Catherine Martin TD, Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, is currently advancing a regulatory framework which will deal with on-line safety and which will include the establishment of an Online Safety Commissioner.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides &euro;2 billion in lending, for terms between three months and five-and-a-half years and offers a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million including working capital and term loan facilities. Loans of up to &euro;250,000 are unsecured.  As a result of the high level of the State guarantee, loans are being provided at interest rates lower than the current market rate for similar loans.</p>  <p>  - The COVID-19 Business Loan provides up to &euro;25,000 to eligible micro-enterprises through Microfinance Ireland with zero repayments and zero interest for the first six months and the equivalent of an additional six months interest-free, subject to certain terms and conditions.  Microfinance Ireland also provides start-up business loans and loans for established businesses for up to &euro;25,000 with interest rates of between 6.8% and 7.8%.</p>  <p>  - The COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme makes lending available from participating lenders to eligible businesses. Loans available under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million and are for terms of up to three years. Loans are offered at favourable terms, including a maximum interest rate of 4% and no security on loans of up to &euro;500,000.</p>  <p>  - The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme is a new scheme which is being introduced in recognition of the additional effects of COVID-19 on Brexit impacted businesses. The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme will provide loans with terms of up to six years with loans to be made available for liquidity/working capital and investment purposes. Loans will range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available unsecured. The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme will be launched in summer 2021 and will replace the existing Brexit Loan Scheme.</p>  <p>  While the State provides funding or guarantees on these loans, the Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process in relation to loans offered under these schemes, which is fully delegated to the participating lenders.</p>  <p>  Where an applicant has had a loan application refused, they may wish to appeal the decision through the individual lender&rsquo;s appeals system. An appeal to the Credit Review Office (CRO) is a further option if the lender is a participating bank. The CRO helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the CRO and the bank.</p>  <p>  I can assure the deputy that officials from my Department are in regular contact with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Microfinance Ireland, the operators of these schemes, to ensure the effective implementation of these schemes.</p></reply>

Applicant companies must be an indigenous retailer, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (eg website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. The Scheme was launched with an initial fund size of &euro;2m. Due to significant levels of interest for the Scheme from eligible retailers and the particular challenges facing the retail sector during the pandemic, the funding available for Call 1 was increased. Under the first call 185 retailers were approved &euro;6.6m in funding and under the second call 145 retailers were approved &euro;5.3m in funding. </p><p>On 4 May this year, Minister of State English launched a new round of the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme. Under this call &euro;5 million will be made available to help Irish businesses to upgrade their websites and improve their competitiveness in online retail. The call closed on the 25 May. </p><p>I understand Minister English will be examining the future role of the Online Retail Scheme in the coming weeks, including whether its scope can be expanded.</p><p>For retailers starting on the digital journey, Enterprise Ireland have put together a Starter Guide outlining the broad range of considerations to be addressed. A copy of the guide can be found on </p><p>For retail businesses that fall outside the criteria of the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme, there are many other financial and non-financial supports available. These include services offered through the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). </p><p>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme, administered by the LEOs, offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 with co-funding of 50% from the business along with training and advice to help businesses trade online. </p><p>Businesses that have already received a Trading Online Voucher can now apply for a second voucher, where upgrades are required. Funding can be used towards adding payment facilities or booking systems to websites or developing new apps for customers. The voucher can also be used towards subscriptions to low-cost online retail platform solutions, to help companies quickly establish a retailing presence online. </p><p>The vouchers are targeted at businesses with the following profile:</p><p>- Limited or no e-commerce presence;</p><p>- 10 or less employees;</p><p>- Turnover less than &euro;2m;</p><p>- Applicant business must be trading for at least 6 Months**;</p><p>- Business must be located in the area covered by the LEO to whom they make their application i.e. LEOs cannot accept applications from businesses located outside theirjurisdiction.</p><p>**applicant business must provide clear proof of trading for a minimum of 6 months to their Local Enterprise Office</p><p>I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector, through the Retail Forum, which is chaired by my colleague, Minister of State English, in developing their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness. </p><p>The wide range of supports to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website </p></reply>

The Government has been working to prepare for Brexit for several years &ndash; with intensive effort across many Departments and Agencies, including legislation, supports for business and other sectors, stakeholder outreach and widespread public communications to promote readiness. My Department and the Enterprise Agencies provide a significant number of Brexit supports including planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, the Enterprise Ireland Ready for Customs Grant of up to &euro;9,000, as well as financial supports for adapting and restructuring business models and grants for research into new markets to assist companies respond to the new trading environment.</p><p>The long-term response to Brexit is for companies across all sectors to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more international markets.  My Department&rsquo;s 2021 budget allocation of &euro;1.13bn represents an increase of &euro;154 million or 15.9% on the 2020 allocation. This is in addition to &euro;100 million earmarked from the Recovery Fund for Brexit. This is a record allocation and will significantly bolster the capability of our enterprise and regulatory agencies to help businesses examine their Brexit exposure, seek advice, avail of customs training and make plans to protect their business.</p><p>Since January 2021, Enterprise Ireland has engaged with client companies through surveys and focus groups to understand the impacts for companies on the new trading relationship with the UK. Companies across all sectors identified common challenges such as the potential disruption from Import Checks which are set to begin in October; supplier issues and transport and logistics; and  general competitiveness of businesses because Brexit &ndash; related customs procedures and added supply chain costs have increased the costs to businesses. Businesses are however gradually adjusting to the new trading realities, finding alternative supply chains and are being encouraged to find new markets for their products.</p><p>While Enterprise Ireland clients are continuing to diversify their export markets, the UK market remains their largest export market. In 2019, Enterprise Ireland clients reported &euro;7.9 billion in exports to the UK, representing 31 per cent of total client exports. Enterprise Ireland remains committed to working with client companies to assist them sustain and grow their business, both in the UK, and through market diversification. This will be delivered through a comprehensive programme of funding, advice and in-market supports to get customs ready, remain competitive in the UK and identify future growth opportunities.</p></reply>

One of the aims of the new Shared Island Unit, established in the Department of the Taoiseach, is further developing our shared island economy. This involves working to deepen our cooperation and investing together for the benefit of the North West and border regions. As part of Budget 2021, the Government announced the Shared Island Fund, with &euro;500m to be made available over the next 5 years to 2025, ring-fenced for Shared Island projects.</p><p>InterTradeIreland (ITI), who are one of the six North/South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, have an important role in helping grow businesses on the island. The body is jointly funded by my Department and its Northern Ireland counterpart, the Department for the Economy. ITI&rsquo;s objective is to support businesses, through innovation and trade initiatives, to take advantage of North South co-operative opportunities, driving competitiveness, jobs and growth. ITI helps small businesses explore new cross-border markets, develop new products and services and become investor ready.</p><p>ITI has been in operation just over 20 years. During that time, the body has assisted over 42,000 businesses, supported the creation of 16,000 jobs and has generated more than &euro;1.3billion in business development value through its programmes and initiatives. Cross border trade now stands at an all-time high. We are now facing new challenges and a different trading landscape, but the promotion and development of cross border trade will continue to be a priority in the period ahead.</p><p>ITI has also had an important role to play in protecting North-South trade in the context of Brexit, as the body is uniquely well-positioned when it comes to understanding the needs of businesses on both sides of the border. We are determined to ensure that ITI is equipped with the funding it requires to continue this important work. My Department has been steadily increasing the funding for ITI over recent years, and their budget allocation for 2021 is over &euro;11million.

The number of individuals from the construction sector claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) rose steadily in the early weeks of the year and reached a high of 62,902 claimants on the 9th February this year.</p>  <p>  The phased reopening of the construction sector, beginning on 12th April with the recommencement of all residential construction projects, saw a sizeable decline in the number of PUP claimants. The full reopening of all construction on 4th May saw further improvements and the number of PUP claimants from the construction sector has now more than halved, with only 28,758 claims related to the construction sector on the 25th May and a further decline of 2,278 on the 1st June.</p>  <p>  This shows that more and more construction workers have returned to work as employment opportunities appeared due to the reduction of public health restrictions on the construction sector. Based on this trend it is likely that the number of individuals from the construction sector claiming PUP will continue to decline over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) has been an important measure that has helped maintain employment in the sector during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  As was the case with PUP, the number of employees in the construction sector that were supported by the EWSS increased sharply in January 2021. This vital scheme continues to provide valuable financial assistance to employers and has helped ensure employees remain within the sector, with almost 37,600 employees participating in April 2021.</p></reply>

Brexit has fundamentally changed the trading relationship between Ireland and the UK and will continue to impact that trading relationship.</p>  <p>  The long-term response to Brexit is for companies across all sectors to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more international markets.  My Department&rsquo;s 2021 budget allocation of &euro;1.13bn represents an increase of &euro;154 million or 15.9% on the 2020 allocation. This is in addition to &euro;100 million earmarked from the Recovery Fund for Brexit. This is a record allocation and will significantly bolster the capability of our enterprise and regulatory agencies to help businesses examine their Brexit exposure, seek advice, avail of customs training and make plans to protect their business.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition for 2021 is to sustain Irish jobs and exports and increase the resilience of the enterprise base with a view to ensuring global exports retain their pre-pandemic, pre-Brexit value of &euro;25.6 bn. The agency&rsquo;s focus will be on supporting clients to adapt and succeed in a post-Brexit environment, sustaining existing export sales and accelerating the diversification of Irish exports. While the UK will remain a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export market in markets beyond the UK will continue to be a priority.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges posed by the double impact of both Brexit and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the CSO&rsquo;s preliminary statistical data for 2020 shows that goods exports were valued at &euro;160,814 million in 2020, the highest total on record. This is an increase of &euro;8,280 million (+5%) over 2019.</p>  <p>  It is too early, based on statistics for the first quarter of 2021, to get a real sense of the impact that Brexit will have on longer term trade flows as there are other contributory factors, not least COVID-19 that has also had a chilling economic effect. Analysis of trade flows over a longer period of time would be required to allow for sound conclusions to be drawn about future trade volumes.</p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success in growing exports has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets will be essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p></reply>

As this continues and as we emerge from the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, Government will support people and businesses to make a full return to work. Our ambition as set out in the Economic Recovery Plan, published this week, is to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by reaching 2.5 million people in work by 2024.</p>  <p>  Since the start of this pandemic, Government has provided unprecedented levels of support to businesses aimed at ensuring that viable businesses will survive this pandemic. The Economic Recovery Plan sets out a new package of enterprise supports and extensions for the most impacted sectors, reaffirming the Government&rsquo;s commitment to taper supports off gradually and to help industries prepare for a return to work.</p>  <p>  From the point of view of both supporting businesses and returning people to work, the future of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme is significant. The EWSS will be crucial for businesses as they re-open as it subsidises a portion of labour costs which gives businesses the opportunity to trade profitably even when operating under public health guidelines which may constrain demand. The enhanced restart payment under the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme for businesses re-opening in June and July and the extension of the commercial rates holiday and tax warehousing will also help industries to re-open.</p>  <p>  Over the longer term, the Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile and supporting people to transition to new jobs in growing sectors of the economy. This will be achieved through a combination of upskilling and reskilling with substantially accelerated training and skills opportunities and investing in areas for long-term growth and increased activation capacity through Pathways to Work 2021-2025.</p></reply>

The overall ambition of the plan is to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by reaching 2.5 million people in work by 2024.</p>  <p>  From the point of view of both supporting businesses and providing employment, the extension of the EWSS until 31 December 2021 is of most significance. The EWSS will be crucial for businesses as they re-open as it subsidises a portion of labour costs which gives businesses the opportunity to trade profitably even when operating under public health guidelines which may constrain demand.</p>  <p>  The enhanced restart payment under the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) to support businesses in meeting the costs of reopening as they exit the scheme will support businesses to reopen and support people returning to work.</p>  <p>  Extension of the CRSS to the end of the year, the new Business Resumption Scheme and phase 2 of the SBASC grant which sees the grant extended to those businesses without a rateable premises with the introduction of a smaller grant for those micro enterprises who are not eligible for SBASC, all reinforce the awareness that Government has of the needs of business and the importance of restoring employment as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Continued deferral of the &euro;2.3 Billion in tax liabilities owing to the Exchequer and the fact that liabilities incurred for a short period after trading resumes can continue to be warehoused will provide additional liquidity and assurances for business that Government is doing everything it can to aid their survival and return them to profitability which will ultimately aid in restoring employment.</p>  <p>  Over the longer term, the Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile and supporting people to transition to new jobs in growing sectors of the economy.

The forthcoming Pathways to Work 2021-2025, will involve intensive work with young people at greater risk of long-term unemployment, in recognition of the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on young people. </p>  <p>  The gradual easing of restrictions has already seen the number of people in receipt of the PUP decrease across the worst affected sectors and the economy as a whole in 2021. On 25 May 2021, there were 333,993 people in receipt of the PUP, down from 598,000 on 5 May 2020, with steady declines recorded throughout the months of March, April and May.</p>  <p>  PUP recipients in the Construction sector have decreased by more than half, falling from 62,902 in February to 28,758 in May. Over the month of May, PUP recipients in the Wholesale and Retail Sector fell from 65,984 to 54,391 as outlets reopened. The sector including hairdressing and beauty salons has also seen PUP claimants fall from 33,609 on the 27 April to 20,031 on 25th May as outlets re-opened. </p>  <p>  The PUP has been extended to the autumn but will be gradually phased out from September. As we enter a recovery phase, we must target resources to re-building our economy. The Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile, by increasing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, and through a focus on expanding sectors. The Economic Recovery Plan also commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework and architecture to ensure the skills of young people are aligned with the needs of enterprise.</p></reply>

This commitment is referred to as the &lsquo;no debit rule&rsquo;. For example, if a Member State converts forests to other land uses (deforestation), it must compensate for the resulting emissions by planting new forest (afforestation) or by improving the sustainable management of existing forest, croplands, grasslands or wetlands. In this way the &lsquo;no-debit&rsquo; commitment incentivises Member States to take actions that increase the absorption of CO₂ in agricultural soils, forests and re-wetting organic soils. The current Climate Action Plan identifies several measures for Ireland to achieve a 26.8Mt CO2eq of abatement over the period 2021-2030 which includes the re-wetting of bogs and better management of peatlands. However, it important to note that there are also activities that could prevent these removals from being realised.</p><p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021, when enacted, will introduce a number of new obligations to help ensure good governance in respect of climate action. The Climate Change Advisory Council will propose a programme of three successive 5-year carbon budgets in a carbon budget programme. Once these economy-wide budgets are approved, I will prepare sectoral emissions ceilings taking into account how land-use emissions are treated, for each relevant sector in consultation with other Ministers. These sectoral emissions ceilings must also be approved by the Government. </p></reply>

The annual management advice of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IF) is supported by the annual assessment of individual stocks by, and scientific advice of, the Technical Expert Group on Salmon (TEGOS).  </p><p>I am advised by IFI that fish counters are one component of the assessment process and TEGOS<b></b>draws<b></b>on a number of data sets including rod catch, commercial catch and catchment wide electro-fishing in its assessments.  </p><p>These assessments also take account of 5 years of the most recent data across all data sets. This is done to assess multi-annual trends, and so that data from a single year does not disproportionately affect the scientific assessments based on the established precautionary principle.  </p><p>The Maine counter differentiates between salmon and sea trout based on signal size and run timings. A large sea trout can be mistaken for a salmon. However, IFI installed cameras on the Maine counter in 2009 and in 2020 the cameras were upgraded and new high definition cameras were installed. The information from the HD cameras is that the numbers of large sea trout in the system are not significant. IFI has plans to upgrade the weir further, subject to environmental and other assessments. </p><p>I attach a comprehensive IFI briefing note on the setting of the available surplus on the river for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for support, applicants must own and live in their home which was built and occupied before 2006 and must be in receipt of certain social welfare payments.  </p>  <p>  To date, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme. In 2020 the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was over &euro;14,800.</p>  <p>  Individual applications to the Warmer Homes Scheme are an operational matter for the SEAI and as Minister I have no role in such matters. However in reference to the case raised by the Deputy, I have been informed by the SEAI that the home in question received works in 2016 under the Warmer Homes Scheme and was not suitable for wall insulation at the time.</p>  <p>  There are nearly 8,000 homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. These homes have not previously received any free upgrades under the scheme and for that reason are the priority to receive upgrades.  Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need are being developed and I anticipate that they will be finalised shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that I have secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. Funding for the energy poverty retrofit schemes has also increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation. In addition, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.</p></reply>

For future RESS auctions this will rise to a 100% REC ownership requirement for entry to the community category.  </p>  <p>  The REC definition employed in RESS was largely derived from the REC definition provided through the EU&rsquo;s Clean Energy Package, with particular reference to Article 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Accordingly, under the definition adopted in RESS a REC must to be open to all potential local members based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria and must be effectively controlled by shareholders or members that are located in the proximity of the project, which underlines the key role of local participation and decision making in the energy projects.</p>  <p>  Proximity is not defined in the recast Renewable Energy Directive, which is currently in the process of being transposed into Irish law. I am not inclined to define proximity through the transposition process underway in recognition of the fact that no two communities are alike. Flexibility as regards proximity will allow local communities to define their own boundaries as appropriate to them.</p>  <p>  Similarly, there is no defined minimum requirement in respect of the number of members a REC can have, as long as the primary purpose of the REC is to provide environmental, economic or social community benefits for its shareholders or members or for the local areas where it operates, rather than financial profits. </p></reply>

This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>The project is due to be completed in 2022.  </p><p>Further details on ESB charge points nationwide can be found at </p><p>In light of the ESB eCars responsibility in the matter of the number of charge points provided by county, I have forwarded the Deputies' questions to the ESB for direct response.  Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days. </p><p>While several private operators such as Tesla, Ionity &amp;amp; EasyGO are involved in providing charging infrastructure, my Department does not hold information on the location of charging infrastructure which has been installed without government support. I am aware, however, that ESB has partnered with Tesco Ireland to install 22kW Standard AC Chargers at a number of Tesco locations around the country. More than 50 of these are planned in total. My Department is also making &euro;2 million available this year through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p><p>In addition to the ESB project, the Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place since September 2019 and will continue to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do</p><p>not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs. Applications are currently being assessed for approval. </p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the SEAI, on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.</p><p>Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. However, there are a number of complex planning issues to address before we can expand the grant in an appropriate manner so as to include the required categories of shared parking. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address the issues.</p><p>On new builds, it should be noted that the EU energy performance and buildings directive requires member states to ensure that appropriate infrastructure is installed in all new residential and non-residential buildings as well as those buildings with more than ten car parking spaces for the purpose of enabling the installation of a larger stage of charging points for electric vehicles. This is currently being transposed into Irish law.</p></reply>

The modal hierarchy seeks to promote sustainable transport modes while the intervention hierarchy seeks to ensure we invest in a manner that is proportional to the issue at hand. However, the hierarchies are not rigid tools and their application will be flexible and pragmatic at the project-level. Investment will remain principles-based and objectives-led. Where solutions that are high on either hierarchy are infeasible or inappropriate to meet the objectives of a given investment, solutions from further down the hierarchy will be considered.</p><p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and securing exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme. Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<b></b>This is also subject to the requirements of the Public Spending Code Guidelines which examine the rationale, objectives, scope, options, costs and benefits of projects and the necessary statutory approvals.  In this context, TII is best placed to advise on the current status and funding of the proposed projects in County Donegal, pending also the Government's review of the NDP.  </p><p>The planning and implementation of the proposed A5 upgrade project is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland authorities. The funding arrangements in relation to the scheme are governed by the commitments in the Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan and in the New Decade, New Approach document. In this context the Irish Government is committed to providing funding of &pound;75 million (sterling) towards the cost of Phase 1a of the A5 upgrade scheme once the statutory planning process in Northern Ireland is concluded and construction commences.  </p><p>Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply.

MiFID II was transposed into Irish law via Statutory Instrument 375 of 2017.</p>  <p>  MiFID II established a position limit and position management regime for all commodity derivative contracts traded on trading venues and economically equivalent over-the-counter contracts. Position limits set a ceiling for the number of shares or derivative contracts that a trader, or any affiliated group of traders and investors may own, so as to prevent market abuse and support orderly pricing and settlement conditions. </p>  <p>  MiFID II also establishes position reporting obligations to enable monitoring of compliance with the position limit regime and mandates the publication of weekly reports by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) detailing aggregate positions held by different categories of market participants. </p>  <p>  Amendments were made to the MiFID position limit regime under the EU Capital Markets Recovery Package that was agreed in December 2020 and published in the Official Journal of the EU in February 2021. The changes were made to make the regime more efficient and to help develop euro denominated commodity markets. Commodity derivatives deemed to be critical or significant as well as agricultural derivatives will remain subject to the position limit regime.  </p>  <p>  The MiFID regulations concerning commodity derivatives is supported by a suite of other financial services regulation. The European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) introduces central clearing, risk mitigation and reporting requirements for over-the-counter commodity and other derivatives in order to make these markets safer and more transparent. The EU Markets Abuse Regulation (MAR) also increases the regulation of commodity derivative markets by, among other things, extending the regime&rsquo;s scope to cover certain related OTC traded instruments which can have an effect on the covered underlying market including inside information for spot commodity contracts within the definition of 'inside information' and extending the market manipulation offence to include, in some circumstances, spot commodities. The EU Benchmarks Regulation further increases the regulation of commodity derivatives by providing a framework for the regulation of commodity benchmarks and their administrators.   </p>  <p>  The totality of financial services regulation of commodity derivative markets, including commodity futures markets, represents a comprehensive set of regulations designed to ensure the proper functioning and integrity of these markets as well as addressing specific concerns regarding the potential impacts of commodity derivative markets on underlying commodity markets. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would also note that the EU Commission, the various EU supervisory and regulatory intitutions along with the EU member States regularly consider the overall framework that operates in the EU in this respect.</p></reply>

The EWSS replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme which ceased on 31 August 2020. </p>  <p>  The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3.2 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;540 million have been granted to 49,500 employers in respect of 570,000 workers.</p>  <p>  To be eligible for EWSS, an employer must have tax clearance for the duration of the scheme and be able to demonstrate that turnover or customer orders have declined by at least 30% due to the disruption caused by COVID-19.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question commenced trading in June 2019 and as such was required to confirm the minimum 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders in respect of 2020 pay dates when compared with the period 1 July 2019 to December 2019 and in respect of 2021 pay dates by comparison with projected calculations for 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  The information provided by the business to Revenue in respect of 2020 confirmed a reduction in turnover of 19%, thereby rendering it ineligible for the EWSS for this period. The information provided in respect of 2021 is incomplete, so Revenue is unable to confirm the employer&rsquo;s eligibility for the EWSS for this period. Revenue will review the position once the required information is provided and is in discussions with the business&rsquo; tax advisor regarding the matter. </p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan, Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

While I recognise the concerns felt by many voluntary and community groups, including the one highlighted by the Deputy, around the cost and availability of insurance cover, he will appreciate that, as Minister for Finance, I am not in a position to comment on individual cases.</p>  <p>  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU Solvency II Directive insurance framework.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that this Government is fully committed to improving the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups. In this regard, the Action Plan for Insurance Reform sets out 66 actions across a number of policy areas. Work is already underway to deliver these enabling reforms. Recent achievements include the adoption of new Personal Injuries Guidelines by the Judicial Council, and the creation of an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance. Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to work with colleagues and stakeholders to drive implementation of the Action Plan and deliver further key reforms in this area.</p>  <p>  With respect to the issue highlighted by the Deputy, it may interest the organisation involved to know that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover. This can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu. I would also note that where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

The Exchequer yield from PRD in the years 2009 to 2018 is set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>PRD Yield</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Year </td>       <td>Amount </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2009 </td>       <td>&euro;837,419,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010 </td>       <td>&euro;948,605,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>&euro;960,224,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>&euro;934,739,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>&euro;925,986,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>&euro;877,800,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>&euro;875,985,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>&euro;705,998,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>&euro;478,617,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>&euro;522,499,000 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Note: The years 2009 to 2016 do not include Local Government PRD yields. The yearS 2017 and 2018 do not include the HSE PRD yield.</p><p>Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, PRD was replaced by the Additional Superannuation Contribution (ASC) with effect from 1 January 2019.  As with PRD, ASC only applies to serving public service employees who have a public service pension entitlement and does not apply to pensioners. ASC forms a significant additional contribution from public servants towards the sustainability of public service pensions. The yield in the years 2019 and 2020 is set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>ASC Yield</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Year </td>       <td>Amount </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;439,440,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;412,243,000 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Note: Figures do not include the HSE ASC yield which can be obtained directly from the Department of Health.</p><p>PRD and PSPR were adopted as part of the suite of financial emergency measures necessary to secure and stabilise the public finances. These measures applied to all relevant serving or retired public servants, as appropriate, and a distinction was not made based on pension scheme membership.</p><p>The ASC was introduced as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020 as a permanent contribution towards the cost of Public Service pensions, relating specifically to pension scheme membership and the costs of the benefits arising from those schemes.</p><p>I  am not aware of any other cost saving measures involving the collection of additional contributions from other public service occupational pension schemes to which the Deputy may be referring. In relation to employee pension contributions more generally, the authorities responsible for the administration and oversight of the other range of schemes operating in the various sectors of the Irish public service are, in general, the relevant employers and Ministers in those sectors. It would be a matter for those sectoral authorities, including relevant Ministers, to supply any specific information which may be requested in respect of queries on employee contributions for individual schemes.</p></reply>

Local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, population distribution, public service demands, infrastructure and other income sources, all factors which should be taken into account when comparing levels of funding in different local authority areas. </p>  <p>  Most of the funding from Central Government must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport. Across all schemes and funding sources, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provided &euro;135.3m and &euro;167.5m to Cork County Council in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The increase between 2019 and 2020 is due to an increase in housing funding, as well as funding in respect of the Covid-19 rates waiver and other Covid related expenses that occurred in 2020. No report concerning funding specific to Cork County Council has been referred to my Department.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to consider how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process. Local authority members may decide, as part of that process, to vary the ARV and LPT in order to increase the revenue available to them.  I note that for 2020 and 2021 Cork County Council raised the LPT rate by +5% and +7.5% respectively. </p>  <p>  The power to vary LPT is a reserved function and local authorities must balance expenditure priorities against available resources. To achieve that balance, the elected members must make necessary choices to balance the level of service provision with the available income. For 2021, 22 of the local authorities throughout the country opted to vary their local property tax upwards while only three have opted to vary it downwards. Arising from these variation decisions, the local authority sector will gain an additional &euro;11.5 million from LPT when compared with 2020. </p>  <p>  LPT funding for all local authorities will be kept under review in the context of the recently announced LPT revaluation process.   </p></reply>

From 1 August 2020, the blanket ban on rent increases inside or outside of a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) was lifted. Despite the lifting of the ban, the standardised average rent rose by just 2.5% to &euro;1,256 from Q2 2020 to Q3 2020 and remained at that level in Q4 2020.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 (RTVA) provided that rent increases were not permitted to take effect during an emergency period, from 1 August 2020 until 10 January 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration.  This ban on rent increases was targeted at the most vulnerable of tenants inside and outside of RPZs.</p>  <p>  The Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (PDRTA) provides that a rent increase is not permitted to take effect during an emergency period from 11 January 2021 until 12 July 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration. This ban on rent increases is also targeted at the most vulnerable of tenants inside and outside of RPZs. The delimiting of landlords&rsquo; constitutionally protected property rights has been carefully and effectively targeted in this regard.</p>  <p>  Rent reviews could be carried out at all times during the pandemic and rent decreases could, and can, take effect. A rent increase is not payable by relevant tenants in respect of the emergency periods identified above. It is payable by relevant tenants from the end of the given emergency period. </p>  <p>  The maximum rent increase is 4% per annum in RPZs, irrespective of the emergency legislation. Where a rent increase cannot be given effect for certain tenants during an emergency period, a total increase of greater than 4% can apply where the necessary rent review notice(s) have been served. In all cases, a tenant must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice before a rent increase takes effect.</p>  <p>  The targeted ban on rent increases under the PDRTA is due to expire on 12 July 2021. A further extension of the PDRTA protections is currently under consideration, to afford more time to the most vulnerable tenants to recover their financial stability. </p>  <p>  The emergency protections against rent increases and evictions for the most vulnerable tenants has meant that they could remain in their home and not face higher rent during the pandemic.  The annual 4% rent increase restriction in RPZs is the maximum allowable increase and landlords are encouraged to consider their tenants&rsquo; situation in the context of any rent review.</p>  <p>  My Department, the Housing Agency and the RTB keep the operation of the rental market under review. Comprehensive rental legislation is planned for the Autumn, with provisions to help provide long term security of tenure for tenants at affordable rents.  </p></reply>

The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is set out in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. </p>  <p>  HAP tenants are required to a sign rent contribution agreement, to pay a weekly rental contribution to the relevant local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme.  As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme.</p></reply>

Accompanying the COVAX payment was an additional &euro;1 million to the WHO to oversee the process of vaccine procurement and distribution. Further contributions to COVAX are under active consideration.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s support to COVAX sits within the broader EU response. So far, the EU and Member States have committed &euro;2.5 billion to COVAX. COVAX is beginning to show some real results; shipping over 81 million vaccines to 127 participant countries as of May 30th. With this donor funding, COVAX has secured options on a total of 3.86 billion doses of vaccines. </p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment leads on Intellectual Property Rights and World Trade Organisation (WTO) matters, including on the current discussion on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement. They are working with the European Commission and other EU Member States on the EU response to the calls for a TRIPS waiver. They are also giving consideration to Ireland&rsquo;s potential participation in technology-pooling mechanisms such as the Covid Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) initiative. My Department continues to liaise with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this and a number of related matters, on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

The evidence to date from a public health perspective is that transmission rates of Covid-19 in schools are low. This is a result of the effectiveness of the public health infection prevention and control guidelines for schools and the successful implementation and adherence of all in the school community to the guidelines. Funding of almost &euro;650 million has been put in place by the Government to support the implementation of these COVID-19 related measures, including funding for PPE, sanitation and additional cleaning.  </p>  <p>  The Department is part of the Testing Pathways Working Group, which is examining the use of antigen testing in educational facilities. The use of antigen testing in educational settings is under review by this group. </p>  <p>  The current policy of the HSE is to continue to use the more accurate PCR tests for testing all index cases and close contacts within the school community and to continue to prioritise the mass swift queue PCR testing for schools which has proven highly effective to date.</p></reply>

The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum.

The review of the current Junior Cycle SPHE course has been completed and will be considered by the NCCA Council this month. This review contains a brief which will inform the work of the subject development groups in formulating an updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification, which will begin in September. A draft of the updated specification will be available for public consultation in Q1 of 2022.</p>  <p>   My Department continues to work closely with the NCCA to determine the approach to best give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

Each school should use their COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with the public health advice. This guidance is focused on the practical steps school must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 996,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  Extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

This process was established to support dialogue with survivors and their representatives while the statutory Commission of Investigation was conducting its examination of related matters.  This important context was recognised in the published Charter, which set out the general functions of the Forum and provided a blueprint for its methodology and programme of work.</p>  <p>  Our learnings from the Forum process primarily centre on the fundamental importance and value of structured engagement and consistent communication with survivors. I recognise that many survivors want to contribute to the development of solutions to the issues of concern to them and their families. As the Deputy will be aware, I have personally engaged with survivors and advocacy groups since my appointment and will continue to engage with those most centrally involved with these matters.</p>  <p>  For these reason, I am committed to ongoing engagement with survivors and their advocates in the context of the 22 actions approved by Government in responding to the findings of the Commission. These measures, which take account of the Commission's recommendations and those of the Collaborative Forum, are intended to respond to the priority needs and concerns of former residents and their families. </p>  <p>  Notably, several hundred survivors have contacted my Department since the Commission&rsquo;s report was published in January.  Many of these individuals had never been in contact with my Department before. This increased level of engagement is also evident from the consultation process established to inform development of a Restorative Recognition Scheme, with approximately 450 written submissions received and 159 participants in 17 online meetings. </p>  <p>  As I have previously outlined, our experience to date tells us that stakeholder engagement at this level requires additional dedicated structures, processes and resources to ensure it can be inclusive, effective and sustainable. I held two virtual meetings with members of the Collaborative Forum in February during which future arrangements for stakeholder engagement was a specific agenda item. The Facilitator to the Forum has engaged in detailed discussions with individual members in relation to a preliminary proposal in this regard. I understand this process is nearing completion and look forward to hearing their feedback. The experience of Forum members, and other stakeholders with whom I have engaged, will assist the development of a new and enhanced model of engagement. </p>  <p>  As I have acknowledged previously, the Collaborative Forum process, including the initiated formative evaluation, was unfortunately interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. After its meeting in December 2019, it was considered necessary to postpone plenary meetings in 2020 in the context of the public health restrictions. A number of members travel from outside the jurisdiction and some were in the at-risk groups identified by public health authorities.  </p>  <p>  The formative evaluation into the Collaborative Forum was commissioned by the then Minister with a view to informing decisions on operation of that model and identifying priority issues for further consideration. In this regard, the outcome of the process can equally contribute to current deliberations on the design and implementation of an appropriate model to support engagement.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the arrangements being advanced to facilitate publication of the Forum&rsquo;s report, I expect to be able to share the outcome of the evaluation with Forum members in the coming weeks.  My Department will engage directly will Forum members in this regard.  </p></reply>

This scheme will include a restorative recognition payment and a form of enhanced medical card. </p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Group (IDG) was established to develop detailed proposals for the Restorative Recognition Scheme, which must then be brought to Government for approval. </p>  <p>To support and inform the work of the IDG, a public consultation process took place during March and April. This public consultation was undertaken by OAK on behalf of my Department. The input from survivors to that consultation is invaluable in order to develop a scheme that will have their needs at its core. I was delighted with the strong response to the consultation process. Approximately 450 written submissions were received and 17 online meetings were held, with one of these meetings specifically arranged for members of the Collaborative Forum. OAK submitted their final report on the consultation process to the IDG on 17th May.</p>  <p>  The development of this scheme is a priority for me and I am aware that the IDG are working extremely hard to ensure that they deliver their report to me very soon. Following this, I will submit recommendations to Government for a decision on the Scheme. The consultation report prepared by OAK and submitted to the IDG will be published after Government has concluded its deliberations. </p></reply>

The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025 across all sectors of the economy including construction. Measures to support employer engagement in apprenticeship, particularly within the SME sector, will be integral to the delivery of that target. </p>  <p>  As a demand driven programme, the number of apprentice placements is determined by employers within the construction sector. In recent years, annual intake in construction related apprenticeships has steadily been increasing, from a low of 650 in 2010 to 3,499 in 2019. The impact of Covid-19 and the closure of the construction sector in March 2020 impacted heavily on apprentice registrations in the first half of 2020. Registrations recovered in the second half of the year with the support of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme, which provides an employer grant of &euro;3,000 payable over two years to support employers who take on and retain apprentices, reaching a total of 3,104 registrations on construction related apprenticeships by year end.</p>  <p>  Work has begun on the implementation of the Action Plan.  Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967 seek to expand the definition of an "activity of industry" to widen the potential scope of new apprenticeship programmes (Action 5.2) has been included under the General Scheme of Higher Education Authority Bill which was published on the 6th May 2021. The Bill also provides for the recognition of a shared office between SOLAS and HEA to facilitate collaboration on the national-level development, monitoring, review and management of the apprenticeship system (Action 12.6)</p>  <p>  Progress towards baseline actions will be reviewed on an annual basis and a report delivered to Government, outlining progress and learnings and setting out detailed areas for action in the next phase of delivery.</p>  <p>  Education and training relevant to skills needs in the construction sector is delivered through ongoing apprenticeship and non-apprenticeship further and higher education and training as well as through specific activation programmes such as Springboard, the Human Capital Initiative and Skillnet Ireland. </p>  <p>  Among the 60 apprenticeships currently available at levels 5-10 on the National Framework of qualifications, the 25 traditional craft apprenticeships at level 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications have been supplemented by new apprenticeships in geo-drilling (Level 6), with programmes in scaffolding (level 5), roofing and cladding (level 5) and advanced quantity surveying (Level 9) due to launch in 2021. </p></reply>

Employment rights legislation protects all employees, including apprentices who are legally employed on a contract of service basis. </p>  <p>  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court. WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches. Complaints can be made on a single online complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website www.workplacerelations.ie. </p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Customer Service Section can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or via its website www.workplacerelations.ie.  </p>  <p>  Generally, apprentices who are employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship are entitled to the same employment rights protection as all other employees employed under a contract of service. However, there are a few exceptions in relation to apprentices:</p>  <p>  -  In the case of statutory apprentices, the Unfair Dismissals Acts do not apply if the dismissal takes place within six months after the commencement of the apprenticeship or within one month after the completion of the apprenticeship. (Section 4 of the UD Act)</p>  <p>  -  An employer of an apprentice is not obliged to pay a redundancy lump sum under the Redundancy Payments Acts if the dismissal takes place within one month after the completion of the apprenticeship. (Section 7(4) of the RP Act)</p>  <p>  -  Apprenticeships are excluded from the remit of the National Minimum Wage.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this it is important to note that it is a central principle of the apprenticeship system in Ireland that both apprentices and their employers are assured of a high-quality apprenticeship experience leading to recognised awards. There are a number of processes in place to support this, underpinned by statute under the Industrial Training Act 1967 and the Quality Assurance and Qualifications Act 2012, including:</p>  <p>  -  &lsquo;The Apprenticeship Code of Practice&rsquo;, published by SOLAS, covers the key obligations of employers and apprentices participating in apprenticeship. Employers are required to sign up to this code prior to engaging apprentices. Companies seeking to recruit apprentices are also required to undertake the SOLAS &lsquo;Suitability to Train Assessment&rsquo; prior to being admitted onto the register of approved employers. </p>  <p>  -  The network of Authorised Officers (AOs) of the Education and Training Boards (ETBs), working on behalf of SOLAS, continually engage with employers and individual apprentices throughout their apprenticeship programme, ensuring adherence to the Code of Practice as well as providing ongoing supports. </p>  <p>  -  All SOLAS approved training organisations and tutors are subject to independent scheduled process monitoring and/or unscheduled assessment event monitoring to ensure adherence with both Quality Qualifications Ireland (QQI) accreditation and SOLAS requirements. </p>  <p>  -  A comprehensive quality assurance process for apprenticeships covers the quality of delivery on and off the job training and is overseen by QQI through co-ordinating providers. </p>  <p>  -  The employer is the provider of &lsquo;on-the-job&rsquo; elements of the Apprenticeship Programme and is responsible for apprentice direction, observation, supervision, and, if applicable, assessment. Employers are required to: </p>  <p>  -  Ensure that the apprentice is released to attend the mandatory apprenticeship induction presentation.</p>  <p>  -  Release the apprentice for the off-the-job training elements of the Apprenticeship Programme on the dates and to the location as notified.</p>  <p>  -  Regularly communicate with the apprentice and his/her workplace mentor and/or assessor/verifier to monitor how the apprentice is progressing.</p>  <p>  -  Be proactive in reviewing the apprentice's progress and provide support, advice and encouragement to the apprentice throughout the apprenticeship.</p>  <p>  -  The trade union movement are an integral part of the delivery of the apprenticeship system in Ireland. This is achieved through membership of the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee (NAAC), a subcommittee of SOLAS, as well as the Apprenticeship Council which has overseen the expansion of apprenticeship over the last five year period to reach a total of 60 programmes across all sectors of the economy. </p></reply>

My Department will also be represented on a Programme Board to be established and chaired by Minister O'Gorman, which will set performance indicators for the new model and monitor progress against those indicators. </p>  <p>  The White Paper proposes that the new system should be phased in and operational by 2023 and that the intervening period should provide an opportunity to progress improvements in the overall processing times for international protection.</p>  <p>  Work is under way in my Department towards identifying mechanisms which will assist with this. For example, additional ICT resources have been secured for this year, and detailed work including an end-to-end review of processes to guide enhanced processing times is under way.

This improved infrastructure, in addition to the continued success of the Cycle to Work scheme and other initiatives, have led to a significant increase in the number of cyclists and bikes on our roads in recent years. </p>  <p>  Inevitably this has also attracted thieves and unfortunately many cyclists have experienced the theft of very valuable bicycles. It is vital that steps are taken to stop this kind of theft and that cyclists know they can trust that their bike is safe. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that there are a number of initiatives being taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle bike theft, including the &lsquo;Lock it or Lose it&rsquo; initiative which was announced on 13 May, which focuses on reminding the public to take extra precautions to keep their bikes safe by locking them in the most secure way possible.</p>  <p>  The Blue Bike scheme has also been designed to highlight bike theft hotspots by placing an end of life bike, painted blue, in such areas with a large sign warning members of the public to lock their bikes and be aware of bike theft.

Other responses that will be pursued by Garda&iacute; include surveillance of known offenders, the monitoring of any offenders&rsquo; current bail conditions and where necessary the appropriate action of any breach of their bail with the relevant courts, and proactive policing, both overt and covert, of hotspot areas. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that theft is an offence under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. Anyone convicted of theft is liable to a penalty of a fine or up to 10 years imprisonment.

As the Deputy will appreciate, the sentence in any individual case is a matter for the relevant Judge.</p>  <p>  In instances where children may be involved in this type of theft, work will also continue under the recently published Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 to prevent offending behaviour from occurring and diverting children and young adults who commit a crime away from further offending and involvement with the criminal justice system. The immediate priority within the new Strategy will be to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects across the State.  </p></reply>

We are working to expand our video conferencing programme with a view to making interviews by video conference a significant element of international protection operations.</p><p>According to IPO records, just under 2,700 section 35 interviews were scheduled during 2020 of which just over 1,100 proceeded.  Just over 1,000 interviews were postponed due to Covid-19.  This figure includes applicants who, unfortunately, had interviews postponed more than once as the situation evolved over the course of the year.  The comparable figure for 2019 is approximately 4,500 interviews scheduled of which 3,200 proceeded. </p><p>In general, the scheduling of interviews by the IPO is done in accordance with the prioritisation policy agreed with the UNHCR and published on the IPO website <i>www.ipo.gov.ie</i>. This prioritisation, provided for under section 73 of the International Protection Act 2015, is subject to the need for fairness and efficiency in dealing with applications for international protection. Scheduling of cases will primarily be done on the basis of the date of application (oldest cases first). </p></reply>

This vital work is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.</p>  <p>  From its establishment in March 2016 to the end of 2020, GNDOCB has been responsible for the seizure of in excess of 133 firearms, &euro;209 million worth of illicit drugs, 5,500 rounds of ammunition and &euro;21.7 million in cash. In 2020 alone, GNDOCB seized &euro;36.7 million worth of illicit drugs, 23 firearms, 2,131 rounds of ammunition, &euro;8 million in cash and made 228 arrests</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, together with Divisional Drugs Units, and Revenue and Customs, have had considerable further success in the first quarter of 2021 in seizures of illegal drugs. The total drugs seized by the GNDOCB in the first 4 months of the year is valued at &euro;28.2m. This represents an increase of 392% over the same period last year, when drugs valued at &euro;5.7m were seized. In addition, approximately &euro;3.8m in cash has been seized in the same period, an increase of 183% over the same period in 2020, when &euro;1.3m was seized.</p>  <p>  More recently, there have been further significant seizures of note. On 28 May last, as part of ongoing investigations targeting persons suspected to be involved in organised crime, GNDOCB carried out an operation in the Meath area, where a vehicle and one premises were searched. As part of this operation, 67.5kg of suspected cannabis herb valued at &euro;1.35 million was seized and two arrests were made.  </p>  <p>  Also on 28 May, Garda&iacute; carried out an operation targeting the sale, supply and distribution of illegal drugs in the Limerick area. A number of premises across Limerick city were searched as part of this operation which resulted in the seizure of suspected cannabis herb worth &euro;900,000 as well as approximately &euro;45,000 in cash. Eight arrests have been made following this operation.</p>  <p>  While public health restrictions have contributed to the increased detection rates, much of the recent achievements can be attributed to the professionalism and cooperation of Garda units, the Criminal Assets Bureau and Revenue and Customs.  </p></reply>

A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been in place since 2009 to conduct investigations into human trafficking. It also provides advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also active in relation to trafficking gangs through work targeting organised crime - targeting their finances, their use of the internet and by working closely with other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  A High Level Group established in November 2019, which includes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department and the Office of the DPP,  meets regularly and keeps the legislative and operational framework for investigation and prosecution of trafficking under review.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to addressing human trafficking in all forms, including through the provision of supports for victims of human trafficking and by educating the public to recognise the signs of trafficking.  We have partnered with the United Nations International Organisation for Migration (IOM) office in Dublin on a campaign to raise awareness that victims of trafficking can be found anywhere and can be hidden in plain sight. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with the US Embassy here on human trafficking issues, and we are currently working on our contribution to the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the Government recently approved plans for a revised National Referral Mechanism (NRM) to make it easier for victims of human trafficking to come forward and be supported.

The Unit also analyses and disseminates STRs and intelligence gained to other national units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Garda&iacute; throughout the country for investigation and potential further action.</p>  <p>  The MLIU supports the FIU within GNECB and it investigates complex money laundering cases and/or cases which have cross-jurisdictional links. It extracts information from the analysis of STRs allowing for the instigation of criminal investigations. Suspected terrorist financing can also be investigated by the MLIU. The Unit also provides advice and assistance to other members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are investigating cases of suspected complex money laundering and/or suspected terrorist financing. </p>  <p>  In addition, I wish to assure the Deputy that Ireland has a robust Anti-Money Laundering/ Countering the Financing of Terrorism framework. Ireland&rsquo;s anti-money laundering framework was assessed by the global standard-setter, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Ireland was found to have &ldquo;a generally sound legislative and institutional AML/CFT framework&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I welcomed the passage through the D&aacute;il of two important pieces of criminal legislation to help combat money laundering and tackle white collar crime. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021 will strengthen existing anti-money laundering legislation and will give effect to provisions of the Fifth EU Money Laundering Directive. This Act ensures that our regulatory framework keeps pace with the increasing integration of financial flows in the internal market, the evolving trends, technological developments and the prevention of organised crime. </p>  <p>  In line with international standards adopted by the FATF, and the EU's legislative framework, Ireland has developed a solid regulatory framework for preventing money laundering. This Act strengthens existing anti-money laundering legislation and contains a renewed focus on gatekeepers of financial systems. It ensures that there is increasing transparency by bringing further institutions within the scope of the Irish anti-money laundering regulatory framework and by combatting the use of new trends and technologies employed by criminals. It also ensures that our regulatory framework keeps pace with the increasing integration of financial flows in the internal market, the evolving trends, technological developments and the prevention of organised crime.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act gives effect to EU Directive 2017/1371 on the fight against fraud to the European Union&rsquo;s financial interests by means of criminal law. The Directive establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions with regard to combatting fraud and other illegal activities (corruption and money laundering) affecting the EU&rsquo;s financial interests.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out to the Deputy that, as outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, the fight against organised crime stretches beyond our borders and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with their international colleagues to break the networks of serious criminals and prevent them from inflicting misery on our communities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly liaises and cooperates with their international policing and security partners, such as EUROPOL and INTERPOL, and the FIU&rsquo;s work makes an important contribution to the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. </p></reply>

However, cyber security issues also pose risks for national security, whether from malign cyber-attacks on critical national infrastructure or in the context of the hostile-state hybrid threats. My Department is focused on the development and implementation of relevant legislation and ensuring that Ireland is meeting its international obligations in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has significantly stepped up its dedicated resources in the cybercrime area in recent years, and is continuing to grow its capabilities in this area. The Garda Commissioner established a dedicated Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB) last summer, led by a Detective Chief Superintendent. </p>  <p>  GNCCB is responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of cybercrime incidents in the State. GNCCB works collaboratively with local and national Garda units along with national and international stakeholders to reduce the threat and impact of cybercrime on individuals and organisations. As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains strong international links and is liaising and co-operating with international law enforcement and security partners such as Interpol, Europol, the FBI and the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency. </p>  <p>  GNCCB is now in an expansion phase, with increases of nearly 80 additional staff planned between this year and 2022, with 25 of these already in place. I am advised that this expansion of GNCCB will include the recruitment of 20 civilian expert posts at engineer grade. Cyber Satellite Hubs have also recently been established in Cork, Galway, Mullingar and Wexford.</p>  <p>  GNCCB&rsquo;s IT capability is also increasing, with a new decryption suite procured earlier this year. This work is also resourced through a smaller expert team in the National Crime and Security Intelligence Service.  </p></reply>

These include increasing access to addiction treatment, employment opportunities and increased use of community funded organisations. A range of objectives and actions have been outlined for progression of this throughout this year as outlined in Goal 3 of the Justice Plan 2021, including the forthcoming publication of a Review on Penal Policy, which will set out actions to be taken going forward in order to reduce the rate of reoffending. </p>  <p>  A number of initiatives have been introduced over the past decade to reduce reoffending including Community Return and Community Support Schemes and the Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC). </p>  <p>  Community Return and Community Support Schemes were introduced in 2011 and aim to increase support for prisoners prior to their release from prison, upon their release, and then for a period after their release in order to break the cycle of offending. </p>  <p>  The J-ARC is a multi-agency response to the supervision and rehabilitation of offenders which commenced in 2014. The programme aims to target prolific offenders who are responsible for large amounts of crime. These offenders are managed through the integration of policy and practice between the J-ARC agencies.</p>  <p>  We have some statistical evidence available to suggest that the initiatives introduced to date to reduce prison re-offending have contributed to a decline in recidivism. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) use data from the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop comprehensive prison re-offending indicators. The latest figures for Probation Re-offending Statistics, published by the CSO in November 2020, is a detailed study of recidivism among offenders placed under Probation Service supervision, including those on Community Service Orders. The Report is based on Reoffending statistics for 2014 and 2015 and in particular the 2016 cohort. </p>  <p>  Overall almost 69% of offenders did not reoffend within a one year period of being placed under the supervision of the Service. The Report also showed that 71.7% of offenders on Community Service Orders did not reoffend within that period and 84.1% for those under Post Release Supervision Order did not reoffend.</p>  <p>  We know that reoffending rates are decreasing over time, with 31.1% of 2016 probationers reoffending within one year, compared to almost 36% of 2008 probationers who reoffended in one year. A similar trend is also observed in the three year study: re-offending by those sentenced to probation supervision in 2014 was 47.2% after a 3 year period, compared to a figure of 54.6% after 3 years for the 2008 cohort. The reoffending rates reflect improvements in Probation Service supervision, and indicates that the Service is continuing to perform well. Reoffending by persons subject to post release supervision is encouragingly low which confirms our belief that supervision and support in the community after release improves positive resettlement and reduces harmful behaviour.</p>  <p>  Last year my Department launched the findings from an international evidence review on recidivism and policy responses. This report, which is the third in a series of releases to be commissioned and disseminated by the Research and Data Analytics unit in my Department,  was prepared by Prof. Ian O&rsquo;Donnell from the Institute of Criminology and Criminal Justice, School of Law, UCD. The review constitutes a valuable resource for researchers and acts as a springboard for future empirical research on best practice in this area.   </p></reply>

It undertakes very limited direct procurement, with the exception of the procurement of transport services for the Islands. All procurement takes place in line with national and EU guidance and requirements, and it is Department policy to utilise Office of Government Procurement framework agreements wherever possible. Where other bodies are provided grant funding by my Department, and this grant funding is to be used for the procurement of goods or services, the grantee is also obliged to follow national and EU guidance where the grant funding constitutes the main funding source.</p>  <p>  The LEADER programme would be the most significant programme in terms of grantees undertaking procurement with tenders for projects under &euro;200,000. In line with the EU Regulations by which it is governed, that programme stipulates that national procurement guidelines must be followed before funding is awarded by the Local Action Groups (LAGs). In cases where the total public funding awarded represents more than 50% of the project costs, the national public procurement requirements developed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) apply. However, where the public funding awarded represents 50% or less of the project costs, the project applicant can follow more flexible LEADER specific procurement rules developed by my Department. In circumstances such as these, written quotations must be sought on the various threshold amounts and there is no requirement to follow national procurement guidelines. My Department&rsquo;s officials have previously engaged with the OGP with a view to simplifying the procurement process for community applicant type projects, which are grant aided through programmes such as LEADER. My Department will continue to explore this matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the OGP, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The agencies under the remit of my Department are Water Safety Ireland, the Western Development Commission, the Charities Regulator and POBAL who are obliged to follow EU and National public procurement rules and procedures. In the case of Pobal the vast majority of their tenders are above &euro;200,000. Where a tender process is below this value Pobal complies with OGP guidelines. To reduce any bureaucracy associated with a below threshold tender Pobal only require a single document for tender responses. This document clearly outlines where tenderers are required to input. Proof of qualifying criteria is only required for the successful tenderer. For procurement processes below &euro;25,000 Pobal uses a simplified quote document. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there are a number of guidance documents and model form contracts aimed at facilitating public bodies in carrying out public works contracts. This information can be found on the construction procurement website www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie. These new public procurement guidelines will be kept under review in light of the impact on operational efficiency, value for money and accessibility to business opportunities.</p></reply>
