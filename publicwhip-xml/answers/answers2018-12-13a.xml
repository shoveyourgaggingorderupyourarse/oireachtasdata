As such, the Early Years Forum which I chair, includes membership from two Irish language organisations.</p>  <p>  While my Department does not currently provide dedicated funding to any specific Irish language groups, it does support Irish in many other ways and has committed to a number of significant actions within the Action Plan for the Irish Language 2018-2022. These actions aim to build and improve on existing measures, supports and partnerships that are provided through, for example, Better Start, the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate and local City and Country Childcare Committees. </p>  <p>  Key among these actions will be the appointment of two dedicated posts to co-ordinate Irish language supports in early years. My Department is currently working on specifying these posts with colleagues in the Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with a view to recruitment in 2019.</p>  <p>  In all, my Department funds some 228 services which identify themselves as Na&iacute;onra&iacute;, both within and outside the Gaeltacht areas.  Total funding of some &euro;16m was provided to such services over the past four years and the many supports which are available from my Department are offered to all early years services and na&iacute;onra&iacute;, both inside and outside the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, I will shortly be commissioning an independent review of structures that support the Early Years Sector. While I cannot pre-empt any of the findings of any such review, I would expect that a key component will be a process of engagement with all of the early years stakeholder groups, including Irish language organisations such as that referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Roll out is expected to begin early in 2019, for completion by 1st June 2020. June 2020 is the date after which Tusla will require every service to meet the new standard.</p>  <p>During 2019 and the first half of 2020, my Department will provide funding to allow one free place on a First Aid Response training course for every service provider in the country. The training will be organised through the  City and County   Childcare Committees.</p>  <p>  Early learning and care providers are all familiar with their City and County Childcare Committee and should be in regular contact with them. In early 2019, the City and County Childcare Committee will be in contact with each service in their area to ensure that they have the opportunity to access the first aid training.</p>  <p>The training will be organised and paid for by the City and County Childcare Committees, through funding provided by my Department. The training will be free at the point of delivery for the staff attending. As a result, no money will be disbursed to early learning and care service providers.</p>  <p>  There are currently 4,519 early learning and care service providers in contract with my Department. Initially, City and County Childcare Committees will be asked to prioritise services who do not have First Aid Response training already and who have other first aid training that is due to expire soon, but they will ensure that all service providers are given the opportunity to have a staff member attend the training.</p></reply>

The figure in the earlier years of ECCE stood at approximately 67,000 children. The increase in participation for this programme year is explained by the extension of the ECCE programme to a full two year provision. </p><p>All children meeting the minimum age requirement of 2 years and 8 months are now eligible for a full two programme years on ECCE. This measure increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from the original entitlement of 38 weeks to a potential duration now of 76 weeks (two programme years). </p><p>This delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Learning and Care providers.  </p><p>Now that we have a full two-year programme, we reduced the number of entry points from three to one in September this year. One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year helps to streamline the administration process and makes it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year.</p><p>It also makes it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children. ECCE now mirrors school entry, with one enrolment point.</p><p>The minimum and maximum ages for ECCE were chosen based on a number of considerations. These were:</p><p>- national experience,</p><p>- a review of international practice, </p><p>- the regulatory environment for early learning and care, </p><p>- issues such as child development readiness, </p><p>- adult-child ratios and the policy of the Department of Education and Skills with regard to school start age.</p><p>I believe that the new system is right for children and helps ensure that parents and providers can plan with clarity for the needs of children.</p></reply>

The Council of Ministers with responsibility for youth policy in each Member State meet twice a year towards the end of each presidency.</p>  <p>  Among the issues discussed at the Council was the European Solidarity Corps which brings a number of opportunities for young people to enhance their personal, educational, social and civic development. It is made up of two strands, the volunteering strand and occupational strand.</p>  <p>  The volunteering strand consists of a full-time voluntary unpaid solidarity activity for a period from 2 to 12 months. It gives young people the chance to take part in the daily work of organisations. </p>  <p>  Activities can take place either in a country other than the country of residence of the participant (cross-border) or in the country of residence of the participant (in-country).</p>  <p>  In the occupational strand, traineeships and jobs provide young people with opportunities for work practice or employment, helping them to enhance their skills and experience thus facilitating their employability and transition into the labour market.  </p>  <p>  Full-time learning and work practice of between 2 to 6 months is remunerated by the organisation responsible for the traineeship of the Corps participant. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I am excited about the opportunities for Irish young people that the European Solidarity Corps will open up and I welcome the fact that the European Solidarity Corps gives special attention to young people with fewer opportunities as Irish youth policy is particularly concerned with inclusion.</p></reply>

The group is co-chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The group is made up of senior officials from both Departments with representatives from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency and the Health Service Executive. </p>  <p>  The key objective of the working group is to examine psychological and mental health services for children and young people with the aim of agreeing a clear continuum of provision and strengthening alignment between providers.</p>  <p>  In order to secure the best possible output it is essential to establish complete and up-to-date information on current provision. My officials have been working with Tusla to establish greater clarity around existing service availability and provision, with a view to ensuring that all respective inputs from the agencies provide a comprehensive overview of provision in this area. </p>  <p>  Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013 Tusla has responsibility for services relating to the psychological welfare of children and families but not for more acute services focusing on complex developmental issues and disabilities and more severe mental health problems. Community-based psychological services are delivered by the HSE with financial support from Tusla. </p>  <p>  Tusla also deliver specific psychological services through the Assessment Consultation Therapy Service (ACTS). ACTS provides multidisciplinary consultation, assessment and focused interventions to young people with complex needs.</p>  <p>  Tusla and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration among the two organisations. Discussions are ongoing between the two organisations to ensure collaboration is effective and sustained.</p>  <p>  A key initiative that will further inform the work of the group is the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project, being established by the Department of Health. Progress in this area, aligned to a clear overview of existing provision and proposed plans from the agencies will identify gaps in provision, areas for alignment and areas for further development. </p>  <p>  My Department will, in conjunction with the Department of Health, and with colleagues in our respective agencies, continue to collaborate with the aim of ensuring aligned and accessible service provision.</p></reply>

These allowed for the creation of new early years places, the creation of new school age places, the essential maintenance and repair of community services and the creation of new natural outdoor play areas in early years services.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Early Years Capital funding may be used to create either 0-3 places or ECCE places, while School Age Capital funding may be used to create school age childcare places.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that this year's funding saw applications approved for the creation of 2,757 new childcare places nationwide. This included the approval of 85 applications for 1,950 new early years places, 697 places for children under 3, and 1,253 ECCE places, and 45 applications for the creation of 807 new school age places.</p>  <p>  Pobal has indicated that for Cork county, 4 applications were approved for the creation of 46 new childcare places: 13 ECCE places and 33 school age places.

I hope to announce my plans for 2019 capital funding very early in the new year.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the capital programmes have not yet fully concluded and thus the figures mentioned are provisional, based on approved funding.</p></reply>

I do not have a role in the family reunification process. Family reunification falls under the policy remit of my Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  A separated child seeking asylum may make an application for  reunification with  family members, depending on the circumstances of their arrival and their status in Ireland. Where the family are already in Ireland, the UK or EU, Tusla will work with the separated child seeking asylum, where it is deemed in their interest, to reunify that child with their family as soon as possible.   Children arriving through the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, and who have their status approved prior to, or within a short period of arrival, are in a position to apply for their family to come to Ireland.  Decisions about such applications are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  A child seeking asylum who arrives at a point of entry unaccompanied by parents or guardians is taken into the care of Tusla and it is required that their leave to remain status is established  before they can apply for family to join them in Ireland. The possibility of family reunification is considered as part of a detailed needs assessment process carried out when a child comes into the care of Tusla.   Not all young persons are in a position to make an informed application for international protection on arrival; some are deeply traumatised from their experiences. They need a period of stability and care before being supported in making their application for residency. Some young people may need medical or psychological supports on arrival, and some may need educational supports and intensive social work support in order to prepare them for making the application.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the process of applying for asylum, and applying for family reunification where eligible, can be difficult, and in some cases stressful. Every separated child seeking asylum has an allocated social worker, who works with the child to prepare them for the application process, and to secure supports for the child in line with their needs and best interests.</p>  <p>  All factors, including potential for family reunification, and reunification with a guardian, are considered by the social worker when evaluating the right time to make an application with a young person. Child-centred practice requires that the individual needs and circumstances of the child/young person, as well as their opinion, are taken into account. In the main, it  is on this basis that decisions about the timing of applications is made.</p></reply>

The scheme will open to applications in October 2019, with payments flowing from November 2019.  Its launch will mark a milestone in our quest to transform Ireland's childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world into one of the best.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to report that good progress continues to be made in the development of the legislative, administrative and ICT infrastructure for the scheme.  </p>  <p>  As you know, earlier this year, with wide cross party support, the Childcare Support Act 2018 was signed into law.  Detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines are now being prepared under the auspices of the Act.  </p>  <p>  I also hope to sign regulations in the coming weeks which will provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services.  This will allow these services to participate in the new scheme from the start.  It also represents an important first step on the path to full regulation for school-age childcare services.  </p>  <p>  Our IT development contractor, Codec, is busy working with officials from DCYA and Pobal to develop the scheme's supporting IT system on schedule and in advance of the scheme's October launch.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive awareness campaign for parents and the public will commence in the spring, alongside training and information supports for childcare providers and other key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  I was delighted in Budget 2019 to have been able to enhance the originally proposed Affordable Childcare Scheme by raising the upper and lower income thresholds. More families will benefit as a result of these revised thresholds. The increase to the lower threshold to &euro;26,000 now poverty proofs the scheme and the increase to the upper threshold to &euro;60,000 net income also ensures that families earning up to &euro;100,000 gross income may benefit from targeted subsidies. </p>  <p>  Registration with Tusla will be a requirement for any childminder wishing to take part in the Affordable Childcare Scheme and, therefore, the widening of registration to more childminders will be necessary if parents who use childminders are to benefit from childcare subsidies.</p>  <p>  I am committed to publishing a Childminding Action Plan in the near future.  The Plan will contain short, medium and long term goals for the sector, setting out steps to move towards the wider regulation, support and professional development of childminders.  In the short term, it will include actions to support already eligible childminders to register and participate in the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 allocated &euro;0.5m to create a team of Childminding Development Officers to support the registration of childminders with Tusla and to help them upskill to the required regulatory standards to be introduced in the coming years.  </p>  <p>  Recent developments for childminders include the opening of a bursary fund under the DCYA Learner Fund to support childminders to obtain a relevant NFQ Level 5 qualification, which is currently required for childminders to register with Tusla. It is anticipated that this financial support will incentivise more childminders eligible to register with Tusla to do so in advance of the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  DCYA also currently provide childminding development grants of up to &euro;1,000 for childminders who provide a home based childminding service.  This grant can be applied for every 2 years to make modifications to the service or to purchase toys, educational material or equipment.  To be eligible for the grant, a childminder must have completed the Quality Awareness Programme or Children First: Child Protection and Welfare training, and be voluntarily notified to their local City/County Childcare Committee or registered with Tusla.</p></reply>

Some 114,000 children are expected to benefit, many of whom will be children of stay-at-home parents.</p>  <p>  Furthermore the current targeted early learning and care subsidy schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, medical cards, or GP Visit cards, again many of whom are stay-at-home parents.</p>  <p>  A universal subsidy is available to all parents of children under the age of three, or whenever the child becomes eligible for the universal preschool programme, regardless of whether parents are working outside the home or not. The Affordable Childcare Scheme, ACS, which is under development will make early learning and care subsidies available on the basis of family income and will be available to stay-at-home parents. This is underpinned by the Childcare Support Act 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for local parent and toddler groups to organise activities for parents and young children in the community to support their development through play. Both working parents and stay-at-home parents participate.  </p>  <p>  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents. A child benefit payment of &euro;140 per child per month is available for all children. Budget 2019 announced an increase to the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,500 per year.</p>  <p>  There has also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016. In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely.  Budget 2019 also announced the introduction of a new parental leave scheme which will be available to both fathers and mothers.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently led the development and publication of First 5: A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families. The Strategy includes a range of measures to support families given the fundamental importance they play in shaping children&rsquo;s outcomes. A copy of First 5 was recently circulated to all Deputies.</p></reply>

However, it should be noted that all HSCL staff are employees of their schools and any extension of the HSCL scheme is a matter for the Minister of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Education and Skills on such issues.

I appreciate that the Deputy is anxious to know the findings of this report. I am also conscious that the matter is the subject of significant public interest.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that the NRP has completed the report.

However, my Department has begun an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991, and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review. This will have regard to income support measures available to foster families generally.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge foster carers as the backbone of our child care services. Foster care is the preferred option in Ireland for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians, and approximately 92% of children in care in Ireland are looked after by foster carers. More than a quarter of these children are placed with relative foster carers. </p>  <p>  The Foster Care Allowance is currently &euro;325 per week per child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week per child aged 12 and over. This payment was protected during recent economic hardships, and it is tax free. It is paid in respect of the child and is provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sporting activities. The allowance is not considered as means for Social Welfare purposes.</p>  <p>  Foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. It is important that foster carers have access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs. Respite care for children may be arranged, if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training is compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high-quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association, which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a phone advice service.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to conduct reviews of child deaths and serious incidents and produce reports that are factually based and identify points of learning with a view to improving the quality of services provided to children and families. The panel consists of independent professionals from a range of disciplines who are engaged for their professional expertise. Reviews are carried out independently by the NRP.  The panel has its own independent legal advisors and its Chair reports directly to the Chair of the Board of Tusla. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has no role in commissioning or overseeing these reports. </p>  <p>  Completed reviews are submitted to the Chair of Tusla. The decision on whether and how much of the report is to be published rests with Tusla.</p>  <p>  The focus of publication is to ensure that the reports are available to the public; the dissemination of learning to staff and to ensure that progress in relation to recommendations made are monitored and reported upon to the Board of Tusla.  The decision to publish is underpinned by  a number of principles including, transparency and accountability, the wishes of the family/individuals involved and consideration of the wishes and best interest of other children from the family who may be in care or living at home.  A decision not to publish a report, or elements of it, is only taken where there are compelling reasons not to do. Such reasons might include ongoing legal/criminal proceedings or where it is considered that the report will adversely affect the well-being of those involved, most notably the family of the young person in question.</p></reply>

All urgent and emergency cases receive immediate attention by the local duty social work team. Other cases are screened as they arrive into Tusla and are referred to family support services or dealt with by child protection teams, as needed.</p>  <p>  Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by Tusla, and often both agencies work together in such cases.  Tusla, when alerted to a child at immediate risk, for instance a young child left alone at home or abandoned, will contact AGS if the child needs to be removed from that situation.</p>  <p>Cases of neglect or risk are managed in line with Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.   I am happy to add that HIQA, in their inspections of Tusla child protection services, verify that Tusla act appropriately in cases where it becomes known that a child is at immediate risk. </p>  <p>  Tusla has also introduced an international evidenced practice methodology called &ldquo;Signs of Safety&rdquo; which should help to improve the depth and quality of the screening and assessments of referrals. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that there are oversight mechanisms in place to ensure that the service provided by Tusla meets the high standards that we expect.</p>  <p>  Tusla provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers. This information provides statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers.</p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority conducts regular inspections against National Standards of  the child protection, foster care and residential care services provided by Tusla.  Inspection reports are submitted to me prior to publication.  Each report includes an agreed action plan to improve the service which has been inspected. My officials  review the issues being raised by HIQA in inspection reports,  including the recommendations made to address any failings or shortcoming in practice and  meet regularly with HIQA to explore how the process can be improved.</p></reply>

I would like to take this opportunity to note that children who arrive with their family and seek asylum remain in the care and custody of their parents.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that a minority  of the referrals made to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency,  in respect of separated children seeking asylum  are  either found to be young people over the age of 18, or they are reunited with their parent/guardian who is already in the country. Where a young person is under 18 years of age, they taken into the care of Tusla.</p>  <p>   The Tusla Separated Children Seeking Asylum Team have developed an effective model of working with these children to identify the supports they need. I am satisfied that the care provided to separated children seeking asylum is of a high standard. The report notes that the standard of treatment separated children receive in Ireland compares very favourably to the services provided in many European jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  All separated children seeking asylum see a social worker on the day of referral, and are placed in the care of Tusla. The children, mainly in the age group 15-17 years are placed initially in a specialist residential unit where they receive supports and undergo a needs assessment which   includes an assessment of medical and educational needs. They may move to a foster care placement, supported lodgings, or remain in residential care, depending on their needs.</p>  <p>  All separated children  have an allocated social worker from the specialist team and have  written care plan, which looks at all aspects of a child's health and development. This includes the provision of language, educational, medical and psychological supports, and a clinical assessment and  decision  on the most appropriate time to support the child in making an to application for asylum.</p></reply>

In that regard, my Department has participated proactively with colleagues in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Education and Skills in agreeing a comprehensive set of actions to be implemented under the Action Plan for the Irish Language 2018 to 2022, launched by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in June 2018.  This five year action plan sets out a range of agreed actions, with associated timeframes, to be implemented in support of the overarching 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 to 2030.  </p>  <p>  My Department has committed to a range of actions designed to affirm the importance of the role that early years settings can play in fostering Irish language proficiency.  The aim of these actions is to build on existing measures, supports and partnerships in the area of Irish-medium early years education and further improve supports and services.  The agreed actions include the creation of two Irish language early years posts to co-ordinate the development of Irish language provision in the early years sector in non Gaeltacht areas, and the establishment of a baseline of supports for na&iacute;onra&iacute; that will inform future policy plans.</p>  <p>  Efforts are also being made within my Department to ensure improved communication with Irish speaking childcare services, in particular in the context of the major national childcare schemes that my Department funds.  For example, in relation to the forthcoming Affordable Childcare Scheme, the website currently in development will be available in Irish, as will the parent application portal.  Communications in relation to the launch of the new Scheme will also be available in Irish.  The contact support centre will have Irish speakers on staff.  Training for the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) that helps children with a disability to participate in the ECCE scheme has been made available through Irish for Gaeltacht pre-school settings, and the AIM website and materials are available in the Irish language.  These are just some examples of the ways in which my Department is engaging with, and ensuring that, Irish medium childcare services are facilitated to provide their services through the Irish language.</p>  <p>  A Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families was launched on 19th November. This ambitious ten year plan contains two actions specifically aimed at supporting the development of the Irish language within the early learning and care sector.  These actions are as follows:</p>  <p>  - Introduce measures to ensure that children in Gaeltacht areas have access to Irish-medium ELC provision;</p>  <p>  - Develop mechanisms to provide Irish-language supports to ELC provision where there are high proportions of children who are learning through the medium of Irish.</p>  <p>   An implementation plan for the actions contained within that Strategy will be published within six months.</p></reply>

In the letter, I noted the failures in the management of the referral made in respect of Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe. </p><p>I asked the Board to consider what steps it would take in terms of a management response (including training, performance management and leadership) and in terms of changing the culture of the organisation to ensure it learns from previous mistakes.

A new <i>One House</i>model will be piloted in 2019, and this represents a joint approach across three Government Departments and three statutory agencies.</p><p>Throughout the country I have seen at first hand the work of Family Resource Centres in transforming lives. I secured additional funding for Family Resources Centres in 2018 and I am pleased to be able to provide further support again with an increase of &euro;1.5 million in funding in 2019.</p><p>I am satisfied that the significant additional resources secured for 2019 will enable my Department and its agencies build on the good work achieved to date. The extra funding continues this Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide high quality services for children and young people.</p></reply>

On December 11 2017, I commenced the remaining provisions of the Children First Act, 2015. This saw the introduction of mandatory reporting of child protection concerns. The Children First Act 2015 places a statutory obligation on persons, who have been identified by virtue of their position, training, qualifications and experience, to make reports of concerns of harm, above a defined threshold, to Tusla, The Child and Family Agency. All institutions providing services to children  who are not in the company of their parents  are now legislatively bound to undertake a risk assessment which should inform their Child Safeguarding Statement.</p><p>The additional resources secured for Tusla in 2019 will assist in meeting key priorities. The additional investment allows Tusla to recruit a range of additional staff to respond to areas of key  risk, and to meet increased demand for services. The Deputy will be aware that referrals to Tusla are increasing on a year on year basis. This increase in funding is also enabling the further management of unallocated cases. To improve the overall functioning of Child Protection Teams, Tusla is in the process of recruiting more administrative staff as well as social work practitioners.</p><p>Tusla has  introduced an international evidenced practice methodology called &ldquo;Signs of Safety&rdquo; which aims to provide a greater depth and quality of the screening and assessments of referrals. </p><p>The first consideration when receiving a referral is the immediate safety of the child. All referrals to Tusla  Social Work Services are screened on the day they are received, irrespective of the source.</p><p>The criteria for a member of the public or a mandated person to consider a referral of a child protection or welfare concern is also detailed in Children First National Guidance and in Tusla's Children First Guide for the Reporting of Child Welfare and Protection Concerns  . </p><p>While the number of cases waiting allocation has risen by 13% compared to Q3 last year, the number of High Priority cases awaiting allocation fell by 14% to 829 at the end of Q3 2108. All cases waiting the allocation of a dedicated social worker are held on the social work duty team who review all cases regularly to identify any changes in a child's circumstances and who will respond accordingly.</p><p>The table below provides a breakdown of cases awaiting allocation by priority level and time waiting. These figures are published on the Tusla website on a quarterly basis.</p><p>Cases Awaiting Allocation by Priority Level and Waiting Time</p><p><table><tr><th>High Priority / Time Waiting</th><th>Q4   2017*</th><th>Q1   2018*</th><th>Q2   2018</th><th>Q3   2018</th></tr><tr><td>&amp;lt;1 month</td><td>196</td><td>250</td><td>421</td><td>259</td></tr><tr><td>1-3   months</td><td>189</td><td>158</td><td>249</td><td>244</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;3   months</td><td>346</td><td>274</td><td>317</td><td>326</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>731</td><td>682</td><td>987</td><td>829</td></tr></table></p><p>*Based on incomplete returns (15/17 areas)<table><tr><th>Medium Priority / Time Waiting</th><th>Q4   2017*</th><th>Q1 2018*</th><th>Q2 2018</th><th>Q3 2018</th></tr><tr><td>&amp;lt;1 month</td><td>623</td><td>923</td><td>958</td><td>560</td></tr><tr><td>1-3   months</td><td>717</td><td>607</td><td>999</td><td>947</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;3   months</td><td>1,248</td><td>1,126</td><td>1,323</td><td>1,606</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2,588</td><td>2,656</td><td>3,280</td><td>3,113</td></tr></table></p><p>*Based on incomplete returns (15/17 areas)<table><tr><th>Low Priority / Time Waiting</th><th>Q3   2017*</th><th>Q1   2018*</th><th>Q2   2018</th><th>Q3   2018</th></tr><tr><td>&amp;lt;1 month</td><td>167</td><td>187</td><td>394</td><td>579</td></tr><tr><td>1-3   months</td><td>355</td><td>164</td><td>624</td><td>624</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;3   months</td><td>519</td><td>496</td><td>571</td><td>835</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,041</td><td>847</td><td>1,589</td><td>2,038</td></tr></table></p><p>*Based on incomplete returns (15/17 areas)</p></reply>

I am attaching a document containing the information in relation to the number of EWO's for 2015 to 2018 per county as requested by the Deputy. </p>  <p>   I am also advised by Tusla EWS that seven further EWOs are in the process of being recruited, four of whom will be allocated to work with the Traveller and Roma communities, on a pilot programme aimed at improving the retention and participation of Traveller and Roma children in schools.

I therefore propose to answer the question in general terms.</p>  <p>  The decision to remove a child from the care of their parents is not one that is taken lightly, particularly at a young age. In all cases, the safety, well-being and best interests of the child must be the primary concern. Situations where a child is taken into care generally take place with the agreement of all concerned and do not give rise to controversy or traumatic circumstances for the child or parent.</p>  <p>  In some situations, such as when a parent resists attempts for a child to come into care, or there is an assessed high risk of violence or risk of harm to the child or adult, the assistance of the Garda&iacute; may be called on. In situations where the Garda&iacute; are involved they make an assessment of the risk and the most appropriate steps to be taken. </p>  <p>  I have been advised that, in these cases social work staff follow Garda instructions, while at all times trying to minimise the difficulties for the child and parent. Taking a child into care is an extraordinary event, and transparency and planning are important. In situations where a child may be at immediate or serious risk, it may not  always be appropriate to communicate plans to parents in advance.</p></reply>

In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented. </p><p>In 2016, the Government established the Public Service Pay Commission to provide objective advice to Government in relation to Public Service pay policy.  Following the publication of the Public Service Pay Commission report in May 2017, the Government initiated negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  </p><p>The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The increases due from 1 January 2018 and 1 October 2018 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2019 and 2020.  </p><p>By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the pay of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p><p>New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, will also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to interventions at points 4 and 8 of the relevant pay scales for all such new entrants to the public service. This measure, should it be accepted by the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, will be effective from 1 March 2019.  </p><p>In accordance with the provisions of Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a more comprehensive examination of the specific recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Forces, which the Commission identified in Chapter 6 of its report in May 2017. </p><p>The Commission's work is on-going.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations that arise from the work of the Commission.</p></reply>

On 10 December, I met with Jeremy Hunt, in Brussels, in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council, prior to Prime Minister May&rsquo;s decision to postpone the meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons and I have been in contact with David Lidington since. The Government, together with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, have made it very clear that the Agreement cannot be renegotiated. This includes the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement and which includes the backstop provisions.    The Withdrawal Agreement, which was endorsed by the EU and agreed with the UK Government, is the best possible deal to protect UK and EU interests and to ensure an orderly withdrawal.</p>  <p>  As President Tusk has stated, the European Council is ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement. It may be possible to provide the UK with reassurances or statements of clarification, but the EU, and the Government, have made it clear that these can in no way contradict or change the meaning of the legal text agreed in the Withdrawal Agreement.</p></reply>

The Online Passport Renewal Service was launched on 30 March 2017. From January 1 to November 29 this year 193,724 passports were issued on foot of applications made through the online service. This figure represented over half of eligible applicants.   The Online Passport Renewal Service has recently expanded to include the online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, to introduce a passport card for children and to expand the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. The service brings significant benefits for citizens with faster turnaround times of 10 working days for all online applications, excluding postage. In addition, the cost of renewing a passport online is significantly cheaper than alternative methods, with fees for all online applications being reduced by &euro;5 across all application types.

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to building on the progress made to establish the comprehensive institutional framework for dealing with the past that is provided for under the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, maintaining the needs of the victims and survivors at the core of our approach.Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland to deal with the legacy of the Troubles.  Successive efforts over the last ten years, from the commencement of the Eames-Bradley process in June 2007, have sought to address legacy issues, in particular to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-13a.121.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121300060#WRC03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</p>  <p>  South Sudan continues to endure a terrible humanitarian crisis, primarily the consequence of conflict. I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.</p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. It is estimated that almost 400,000 people have died, and 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place in November.</p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as Head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.</p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.</p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.</p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the sectors to which the 9% VAT rate applies remains strong.  </p>  <p>  Given the impact of an increase in the VAT rate on the hospitality sector has only recently been reviewed by the Department, there does not seem to be a case for reviewing the impact of the increase three months after its implementation.</p></reply>

It may be applied on a voluntary basis by any institution involved in mortgage credit.  </p>  <p>  The Code of Practice applies to a loan secured by the mortgage of a residential property.  For the purposes of this Code of Practice, a residential property is not limited to a principal private residence.  </p>  <p>  This Code of Practice remains in place, but as it is a voluntary code, it does not have a legislative basis and is not subject to the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s administrative sanctions process.  In relation to written consent being given when the mortgage contract is signed, the Central Bank has informed me that it cannot comment on individual mortgage contract terms.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) is a statutory Code which must be complied with by all regulated financial services providers providing financial services within the State.  This Code requires that, where a regulated lender intends to transfer all or part of its loan book, it must provide advance notification to both the Central Bank and affected consumers.  I would draw Deputies' attention to Provision 3.11 of the Code which states:  &ldquo;Where a regulated entity intends to cease operating, merge with another, or to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated entity it must: a) notify the Central Bank immediately; b) provide at least two months notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements; c) ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to the transfer, merger or cessation of operations or, alternatively in the case of a transfer or merger, inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided following the transfer or merger; and d) in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform the consumer that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case.&rdquo; Where the transferee is an unregulated entity, the Code requires that the regulated lender also notify the consumer of the regulated entity that will be &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; the loan for the unregulated entity. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 ensures that borrowers whose loans are transferred retain the same protections which they had prior to the transfer, including protections under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code. I do not have to remind the Deputy of his own Private Member's bill which will require the regulation of loan owners. Therefore I do not have any plans to put the Code onto a statutory footing at present.</p></reply>

I have therefore consulted with the Central Bank on the matters raised by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that the Solvency II Directive represented a substantial overhaul of European insurance regulation. It set out new, more comprehensive EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection. The Directive entered into force on 1 January 2016, and is transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (SI 485 of 2015).   All insurance undertakings across the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Directive (with certain limited exceptions). Failure to comply with its duties and obligations can result in the withdrawal of an insurance company&rsquo;s authorisation under Article 144 of the Directive. Further detailed provisions are also in place around their capital requirements and what happens should they breach them (Articles 136 to 143).</p>  <p>  A central element of Solvency II Directive is that it allows an insurance undertaking authorised in one member state to conduct business in another EU/EEA state either through:</p>  <p>  - establishing a branch operation in the host country and thus conducting business on a &lsquo;freedom of establishment&rsquo; (FOE) basis; or</p>  <p>  - writing business from the home country (i.e. where authorised) into the host country on a &lsquo;freedom of services&rsquo; (FOS) basis.</p>  <p>  Where an insurer conducts business in this State either through FOE or FOS, the supervisory authority who has authorised the company (Home supervisor) is responsible for the prudential supervision and regulation of the Irish business of such undertakings.  However, I have been informed that the Central Bank actively engages with the National Supervisory Authorities of all entities writing material levels of business in Ireland in order to keep itself up to date on developments. In this regard, I understand that the Bank has developed close working relations and established regular contact with relevant Home supervisors to discuss concerns, issues and market changes and challenges.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that as a Host Supervisory authority, the Bank is empowered under Article 155 of Solvency II to take steps in the event an insurance undertaking is not complying with legal provisions applicable to it when operating here.  This Article therefore facilitates  the Bank's  supervision of undertakings authorised in another Member State in relation to how they conduct their business in this country.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, while the provision of cross-border insurance is an essential part of the Single market, it is acknowledged that there are obvious difficulties which arise when an insurer fails. It is important therefore that EU supervisors properly and consistently supervise the insurers that they authorise, and that there is greater communications between supervisors across the EU about their respective companies conducting cross-border business. It should be noted that as part of the ongoing review of the European Supervisory architecture, there is a proposal to further improve cross-border co-operation and communication through the strengthening of Cross-Border Collaboration Platforms. These already operate on an ad-hoc basis, however this proposal would ensure a more formal structure is put in place where an insurer is doing a lot of cross border business. This would therefore give the supervisors of countries into which insurance is written a greater insight into how the business is being conducted.</p></reply>

Solvency II was designed to modernise supervision, deepen market integration and increase the competitiveness of European insurers. </p>  <p>  EIOPA is part of the European System of Financial Supervision which is an integrated network of national and European supervisory authorities that provides the necessary links between the macro and micro prudential levels, leaving day-to-day supervision to the national level. </p>  <p>  EIOPA&rsquo;s core responsibilities are to support the stability of the financial system, transparency of markets and financial products as well as the protection of policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries. EIOPA is commissioned to monitor and identify trends, potential risks and vulnerabilities stemming from the micro-prudential level, across borders and across sectors.</p>  <p>  EIOPA, where necessary, provides for non-legally binding guidelines and recommendations concerning the implementation of the provisions of the Solvency II Directive and its implementing measures in order to enhance the convergence of supervisory practices. </p>  <p>  EIOPA and the supervisory authorities of the Member States collaborate closely with each other to facilitate the supervision of insurance and reinsurance within the EU and including the  examination of any difficulties, which may arise in the application of the Solvency II Directive.</p>  <p>  National Supervisory authorities are required to inform EIOPA of any major difficulties in the application of the Solvency II Directive and both EIOPA and the supervisory authorities of the Member States concerned in such situation shall examine those difficulties as quickly as possible in order to find an appropriate solution. </p>  <p>  In accordance with their founding EU Regulation (1094/2010 EU) ,EIOPA may investigate non-application by national supervisory authorities of the Solvency II Regulations, or their application in a way, which appears to be a breach of Union law, resulting in a written recommendation to that supervisory authority.  Where the competent national authority does not follow the recommendation, the EU Commission may issue a formal opinion taking into account the EIOPA recommendation, requiring the competent authority to take the actions necessary to ensure compliance with Union law.   Finally, in exceptional situations of persistent inaction by the competent authority concerned, EIOPA may, as a last resort, adopt decisions addressed to individual financial institutions.   In addition, EIOPA is required to report regularly and at least every two years to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the progress of the supervisory convergence in the EU.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that it fully participates, endorses and supports EIOPA&rsquo;s mandate to contribute to the establishment of high quality common regulatory and supervisory standards and procedures and regularly contributes and provides feedback to enhance such convergence. </p>  <p>  In February 2017, EIOPA developed a cross-border platform of cooperation between National Supervisory Authorities, and the Central Bank of Ireland has advised me that they participate fully in these platforms with other relevant supervisory authorities. These platforms provide all National Supervisory Authorities with the opportunity to discuss concerns in relation to specific undertakings, local markets and share general market developments.  It should be noted that as part of the ongoing review of the European Supervisory architecture, there is a proposal to further improve cross-border co-operation and communication through the strengthening of these Cross-Border Collaboration Platforms in order to give supervisors of countries into which insurance is written a greater insight into how the business is being conducted.</p>  <p>  Finally, I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland was also part of the EIOPA working group set up to amend the General Protocol to increase the level of information shared between National Supervisory Authorities. In January 2017, EIOPA revised the General Protocol now called EIOPA Decision on the collaboration of the insurance supervisory authorities. The new Decision addresses new flows of information and increased collaboration between supervisory authorities and strengthens EIOPA&rsquo;s role as the central hub for information collection and sharing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-13a.153.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121300060#WRC07000"><p>At the outset I would like to say that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and have no role in the day to day supervision of insurance companies. I have therefore consulted with the Central Bank on the matters raised by the Deputy.</p><p>The Central Bank has advised that under European law, the Home supervisory authority is responsible for the prudential supervision and regulation of undertakings operating in Ireland on a freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment basis. In the case of freedom of service business the role of a managing general agent (MGA) is in general terms, to provide access to the market for the cross border insurer. In carrying out this function it must comply with the relevant domestic insurance distribution legislation and the conduct of business rules. While an MGA has a responsibility to its consumers to treat them in a fair and transparent way, and it is in their interests to be selling products from a financially sound insurer, it has no insight into the underlying financial health of such companies other than  any publically available information. In addition the overarching prudential framework (Solvency II) is designed to provide them with the necessary certainty that any insurer they act on behalf of is financially sound </p><p>Despite the many safeguards in the solvency framework which are designed to minimise the likelihood of insurance failure and the costs to policyholders in the event of failure, it should be noted that Solvency II is not a 'no-failure' regime. It is not possible to build a viable system that provides a cast iron guarantee that no insurer will ever fail. Solvency II is a risk based approach and it is not feasible for insurers to hold sufficient capital to cover every possible event. Instead, it provides that sufficient capital be held in order to ensure that insurers will be in a position, with a probability of 99.5%, to meet their obligations to policyholders and beneficiaries over the following 12 months.  In the design of any regulatory system, it must be kept in mind that protection comes at a cost, in other words the higher the level of the guarantee, the higher the cost to policyholders and the economy as a whole. A balance has to be struck in order that insurers can offer affordable, yet sufficiently safe insurance products.</p><p>The Deputy should also note that the Central Bank actively engages with the National Supervisory Authorities of all entities writing material levels of business into the Irish market. I understand that it has developed close working relations and established regular contact with the Home Authorities to discuss concerns, issues and market changes and challenges.</p><p>In relation to the regulation of MGA&rsquo;s the Central Bank is the competent authority in Ireland for the authorisation and supervision of insurance intermediaries under the European Communities (Insurance Distribution) Regulations 2018 (IDR).  The supervision process for an insurance intermediary mirrors the general supervision approach of the Central Bank.  This general supervision approach seeks to ensure that all regulated financial services providers meet their responsibilities to have strong management, internal control and compliance procedures in place, and have people of integrity and competence at all levels in their organisations.</p><p>The Central Bank recently published the findings from a thematic inspection of Retail Intermediaries acting as Managing General Agents (MGAs).  The report can be found here:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The Central Bank maintains a register of Insurance Intermediaries that is publically available on its website.  As MGAs are authorised under the IDR they are included in this register. The register can be found here: <i>.</i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-13a.156.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121300060#WRC07300"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that I am very conscious of the problems caused in recent years by a number of non-life companies passporting into the Irish market particularly on the motor side.  I am very unhappy that supervisors in the authorising countries in question have not done their job adequately, and as a result the Irish Compensation Fund and by extension, Irish policyholders have had to pay the price for these failures. On the other hand, however, Ireland is a major beneficiary of the cross border passporting regime particularly on the Life insurance side. In addition, as you are aware all interested observers of the Irish motor insurance market in recent years have been signalling the need to make it more competitive by encouraging new entrants. Generally because of the relatively small scale of the Irish market most new entrants will be freedom of service operators. Consequently, whilst there are undoubtedly some problems with the passporting model, it is likely that consumers would have greater difficulty getting competitively priced cover in its absence.</p><p>In relation to engaging at European level, my officials attend the Commission Expert Group on Insurance issues which is held at least three times per year (e.g. 6 February, 29 May and 20 September 2018 this year).  This Group provides a forum to discuss issues such as the consistent application of Solvency II as well as proposals for any amendments to the Directive including Commission Delegated Regulations. As it has been some time since the Council has discussed insurance matters I have not to date directly raised with my European counterparts issues regarding insurance regulation, consistent enforcement of European insurance regulation and the need for compensation mechanisms to be put in place across the EU.  However, the Deputy can be assured that as and when appropriate I will do so.</p><p>At present, there is no harmonisation of insurance guarantee schemes across Europe. However, there have been a number of reports and initiatives in this area in recent years including:</p><p>- A 2010 Commission white paper on the introduction of an EU wide framework of Insurance Guarantee Systems. No significant progress was made on this framework subsequently as the development of Solvency II was the priority piece of work.</p><p>- A 2015 Commission discussion paper on the possibility of introducing a recovery and resolution regime for insurance undertakings which could include an Insurance guarantee Scheme.</p><p>- In 2017 the Commission issued a questionnaire to all Member States seeking information on Recovery and Resolution including experiences with failures and near-failures of insurers.</p><p>- The European Systemic Risk Board published a report &ldquo;Recovery and Resolution for the EU insurance sector: a macro prudential perspective&rdquo; in August 2017. The Central Bank of Ireland was represented on the drafting team.</p><p>- EIOPA published an Opinion to Institutions of the European Union on the Harmonisation of Recovery and Resolution Frameworks for (Re) Insurers (July 2017).</p><p>- Work is also underway at an EIOPA level, where a project group has been set up to examine more broadly recovery and resolution within insurance and in relation to Insurance Guarantee Schemes, a discussion paper was published on this topic:</p><p><i></i></p><p>Recently, in May 2018 the European Commission proposed an amendment to the Motor Insurance Directive which would oblige member states to set up Insurance Guarantee Schemes to cover the cost of insolvent motor insurers. This is still subject to negotiation  so the technical details are being worked out, but you can rest assure that my Department and the Central Bank are continuing to work closely with their European counterparts on this issue.</p><p>Finally, while the provision of cross-border insurance is an essential part of the Single Market, it is acknowledged that there are obvious difficulties which arise when an insurer fails. It is important that EU supervisors properly and consistently supervise the insurers that they authorise, and that there is greater communications between supervisors across the EU about their respective companies conducting cross-border business. It should be noted that as part of the ongoing review of the European Supervisory architecture, there is a proposal to further improve cross-border co-operation and communication through the strengthening of Cross-Border Collaboration Platforms. These already operate on an ad-hoc basis, however this proposal would ensure a more formal structure is put in place where an insurer is doing a lot of cross border business. This would therefore give the supervisors of countries into which insurance is written a greater insight into how the business is being conducted.</p></reply>

Immediately converting the Global Portfolio into cash is not a preferred option, as interest rates on cash are negative. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the overall objective of ISIF&rsquo;s Global Portfolio is to preserve capital by limiting downside valuation exposure and ensuring that capital is available for investment in Ireland as required over the transition period, while also making a positive contribution towards ISIF&rsquo;s investment return objective. This requires ISIF, through its investment managers, who are procured on a competitive basis, to implement a dynamic, diversified, highly liquid, low-risk global portfolio that includes a mix of asset classes including cash, debt instruments, equities, property and alternative investments such as absolute return funds. ISIF&rsquo;s absolute return strategies, by design, have (i) low correlation to global markets, thereby delivering diversification benefits, and (ii) much lower volatility than equity markets. </p>  <p>  As part of the wider Global Portfolio strategy, absolute return strategies comprise &euro;1.8bn (27%) of the Global Portfolio as at end September 2018.  ISIF publicly discloses the investment performance of its Discretionary Portfolio and of the Global and Irish sub-portfolios. Performance numbers for 2018 will be published in early February 2019.</p></reply>

Further study is required to identify the most financially, environmentally, and technically viable measures, and the OPW and WCC are working together in considering this. </p>  <p>  Flood defence works in New Ross are substantially completed by WCC. The OPW is currently considering potential funding support for the WCC scheme in the town.</p>  <p>  There are currently no applications on hand from Wexford County Council under the OPW's Minor Flood Works and Coastal Protection Scheme</p>  <p>  A coastal minor works project at Arthurstown was completed in 2018, and funding of &euro;126,000 was approved for a project at Wexford Racecourse in 2018. </p>  <p>  Minor Works projects at Donaghmore Graveyard &amp;amp; Ballyhack were completed in 2016.</p></reply>

The rules are transposed into Irish law and apply to tenders for public contracts whose monetary value exceeds certain thresholds. </p>  <p>  The National Public Procurement Policy Framework sets out the overarching policy for public procurement in Ireland.  It sets out the procurement procedures to be followed by Government Departments and public bodies under national and EU rules. The Framework covers contracting authorities including individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and private entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, when awarding contracts for goods and services.  </p>  <p>  However, it is a matter for individual contracting authorities to ensure that their public procurement function is discharged in line with their governance and accountability arrangements including procurement rules and procedures.   While the OGP's policy framework and public procurement guidelines facilitate and enable compliance with public procurement rules, it is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure they adhere to these rules.</p></reply>

Of these, 3 are ASD early intervention classes, 35 are primary ASD classes and 22 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Galway has increased from 17 in 2011/2012 to 60 in 2018/2019. </p><p>While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in the child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed the Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand in Galway.</p><p>Special classes for students with ASD are staffed with a pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level (including early intervention classes) and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have a minimum of two SNAs for every class of 6 children. </p><p>My Department's policy is to provide for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs, including Autism (ASD), in mainstream school settings, unless such a placement would not be in the best interests of the child concerned, or the children with whom they will be educated.</p><p>ASD Early Intervention special classes are available for children aged 3-5 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Early intervention classes are intended to provide early support for children with ASD before they start school. Following early intervention, children will attend a mainstream class unless there is professional guidance that they require a special class or a placement in a special school.</p><p>The greater proportion of children with ASD attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. </p><p>Some students with ASD, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there and placement in an ASD special class should be considered. </p><p>Special classes are part of a continuum of educational provision that enables students with more complex special educational needs to be educated, in smaller class groups, within their local mainstream schools. They offer a supportive learning environment to students who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day. </p><p>Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.</p><p>Special school placements are provided for other students with ASD and very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week. Enrolment of a child in a special school is based on a professional assessment in consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p><p>The Department is aware that the establishment of special provision in some schools and communities can be challenging. The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p><p>Section 8 of the Act, which commenced Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

The relationship between teachers and private providers of education is based on a private contract and issues relating to working conditions including payment are a matter between the two parties and do not come under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  I understand that a liquidator is being appointed to the school in question.  I regret that this situation has arisen for the teachers and students of this school. My colleague Minister Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor and I have separately met with some of the affected teachers. </p>  <p>  There is an extensive range of legislation in Ireland which protects the employment rights of workers in relation to equality, employment contracts, payment of wages and related matters. It is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to ensure that their employees receive their employment rights. Where an employee considers that their rights have been breached, the individual can bring a claim under the appropriate legislation to the Workplace Relations Commission. In addition, the WRC is responsible for monitoring a range of employment rights through its Inspection Service.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is currently progressing a new piece of legislation through the Oireachtas which will further strengthen the regulatory framework in this area. The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 includes requirements that employers provide employees with certain terms of employment within a certain period after commencing employment; to impose sanctions for certain offences; to further provide for a minimum payment due to employees in certain circumstances; to prohibit contracts specifying zero as the contract hours in certain circumstances and to provide for the introduction of banded contract hours; to further provide for prohibition of penalisation and for those purposes to amend the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997; to amend the Workplace Relations Act 2015.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy may be aware that legislation is also being progressed by my Department which will strengthen the regulation of the English language sector. The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018 is currently before the Seanad.  This new Bill will establish the International Education Mark (IEM).  The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector and will provide a full quality framework for the provision of education to international learners in the future.  Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) will be allowed to carry the Mark. </p>  <p>  The Bill also contains provisions to provide QQI with additional statutory powers to examine a provider&rsquo;s financial sustainability and to evaluate a provider&rsquo;s corporate fitness.  These provisions will enable QQI to examine the bona fides of a provider in addition to assessing that the provider has the capacity and capability to implement the quality assurance processes and provide programmes of education and training consistent with the requirements of the Act.  All providers, including English language providers, will have to satisfy QQI in relation to issues such as the legal personality, ownership and corporate governance arrangements in addition to examining that adequate financial resources are in place to ensure the viability of these businesses. </p>  <p>At Committee Stage reading of the Bill which was initiated on 5th   December 2018 Minister Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor announced her intention to appoint an experienced mediator to meet with bodies representing employers and employees in the English language education sector to explore the potential for a Registered Employment Agreement to be developed for workers in the English language sector.  The necessary arrangements for the appointment of this mediator are being progressed by my Department.</p></reply>

Youthreach provides up to two years integrated education, training and work experience for unemployed early school leavers without qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age.   It includes a considerable amount of personal development and exploration, where participants needs, interests and capacities are fully taken into account. There is a strong emphasis on personal development, on the core skills or literacy/numeracy, communications and IT, along with a choice of vocational options and a work experience programme.  The programme offers participants the opportunity to identify and pursue viable options within adult life, and provides them with opportunities to acquire certification. Youthreach includes a work experience element to prepare participants for progression on to further study, further training or working life.</p>  <p>  Youthreach participants can receive an allowance of &euro;40 for attending the programme, based on their age. There is also a small meals allowance and, where applicable, a travel allowance.</p>  <p>  The treatment of child dependents who are not attending school for the purposes of social welfare payments is a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

There are a number of reasons why it might be necessary to take a minor into wardship, with some being discharged from wardship when they turn 18. The most common reason is that the child has been awarded substantial damages by the Court and has special housing or care needs. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that wardship is declared only where it is considered to be necessary for the protection and/or benefit of the child. In the cases where there are ongoing care and related needs, it is often more efficient and less costly to the child if such matters can be looked after by the Wards of Court Office in consultation with the child&rsquo;s guardians and under the direction of the President of the High Court. The guardians appointed by the President of the High Court are usually the child's parents. </p>  <p>  The Wards of Court Office appoints a case officer for each ward of court when he/she is brought into wardship. The case officer meets with the guardian(s) and will liaise with them throughout the wardship to ensure that the care and monetary needs of the child are met, taking into account the initial award. Any questions raised by family members regarding any issue or concern are dealt with by direct contact between the guardian(s) and the case officer. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, wardship funds are not public funds. The funds of a person who is taken into wardship move into the custody and supervision of the High Court which then holds and invests those funds as appropriate for the benefit of the ward. The Courts Service has advised that the management of court funds by the Courts Service is sensitive to, and takes full account of, the needs of the wards of court. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has informed me that a conservative investment policy is followed. When deciding where and how to invest court funds, the overriding objective is the achievement of an optimal total financial return having regard to the need for liquidity and capital security, taking account of income generation and capital growth requirements. Where there is a requirement to generate a higher return to sustain the value of the funds for the longest period possible, such funds are invested in longer term growth and income generating strategies. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I have signed the Commencement Order bringing Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 into operation with effect from 1 October 2018. The Act, which allows courts the power to award periodic payments rather than a lump sum payment in cases of catastrophic injury, will provide much needed financial security to persons requiring lifelong care and assistance following a catastrophic injury. I believe that the availability of a periodic payment to catastrophically injured persons will ensure that they will receive the care and assistance they require for the rest of their lives.</p>  <p>  In terms of other legislation, the Deputy will be aware the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. </p>  <p>  The Act provides for the repeal of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 and the Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811. The current Wards of Court system for adults will be phased out over a three year period from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act. The Act offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability. </p>  <p>  Each adult ward (a ward who has attained the age of 18 years by the date of commencement of Part 6 of the Act) will be reviewed in accordance with the new system. A ward who is found to have capacity will be discharged from wardship. A ward who continues to have capacity needs will be discharged from wardship and offered the support option most appropriate to his or her needs. </p>  <p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that no further legislative changes are anticipated at this time.</p></reply>

The scope for refurbishing and developing the existing courthouse on Ashe Street to provide the envisaged accommodation is extremely limited due to the nature of the building and the constrained nature of the site.</p><p>The Courts Service has also advised that it is currently considering a number of options for Tralee Courthouse, including the level of extension and refurbishment achievable within the confines of the existing courthouse site; whether it would be feasible to acquire an adjacent town centre site and the degree of extension and refurbishment this would allow. Previous efforts to acquire adjacent sites on Ashe Street have not been successful as the sites could not be acquired at a price that represented value for money. </p><p>A further option is to build a new modern courthouse on a greenfield/brownfield site and a number of potential sites are being considered in this regard.  </p><p>The Courts Service has further advised that the Chief Executive of the Courts Service has recently met with the Chief Executive of Kerry County Council in Tralee to discuss the future provision of court facilities there. The Courts Service has informed me that a decision has not yet been made and that all options are under review.</p><p>A number of developments in relation to Courts Service accommodation requirements are outlined in the Government's recent National Development Plan 2018 - 2027. They include: </p><p>-  Further new or refurbished courthouses in regional cities and county towns where facilities remain substandard (including Galway City, Wicklow Town, Portlaoise, <b>Tralee</b>and Roscommon) and further provincial locations such as An Clochan Liath (Dungloe) to serve as the Gaeltacht court for the region, and Tuam;</p><p>-  Regional Family Law Centres;</p><p>-  A nationwide condition survey of all court buildings in the estate will be undertaken to determine their condition and identify works required in relation to any issues identified and meet ongoing maintenance requirements.</p><p>The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period remains to be fully determined. It will be dependent on the outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs which will determine prioritisation of projects from a timing and budgetary perspective.</p></reply>

In order to succeed it must be proven: </p><p>(a) that the person alleged to exert the influence had the power or opportunity to do so; </p><p>(b) that undue influence was in fact exerted; and</p><p>(c) that the will was the product of influence. </p><p>In my view, the statutory provisions referred to above and relevant case law provide adequate safeguards for the making of valid wills. While I have no current plans to amend legislation in this area, the operation of the law in this area is kept under review in my Department. </p></reply>

In addition, 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes will be carried out, bringing to 9,000 the additional scope activity provided by the NTPF since the start of 2018. Furthermore, 40,000 Outpatient appointments will be arranged as part of 2019 activity. It is expected that a further 34,000 patients who no longer need treatment will be removed from the waiting lists by the NTPF Central Validation Unit. </p><p>As a result, the number of patients waiting for a hospital procedure is projected to fall to below 59,000 by the end of 2019. </p><p>My Department is working closely with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise a Scheduled Care Access Plan for inpatient/daycase and outpatients for 2019. </p><p>In 2019, the NTPF and HSE will continue to work closely with Hospital Groups, inviting proposals to improve access for patients waiting for either inpatient/daycase or outpatient procedures. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the attached tables.</p><p><b>IPDC Mayo University Hospital</b><table><tr><th></th><th>0-3 mths</th><th>3-6 mths</th><th>6-9 mths</th><th>9-12 mths</th><th>12-15 mths</th><th>15-18 mths</th><th>18-24 mths</th><th>24-36 mths</th><th>36-48 mths</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Latest</td><td>885</td><td>519</td><td>340</td><td>189</td><td>95</td><td>50</td><td>24</td><td>16</td><td>4</td><td>2122</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>900</td><td>478</td><td>250</td><td>98</td><td>68</td><td>37</td><td>23</td><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>1866</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Outpatient Mayo University Hospital</b><table><tr><th></th><th>0-3 mths</th><th>3-6 mths</th><th>6-9 mths</th><th>9-12 mths</th><th>12-15 mths</th><th>15-18 mths</th><th>18-21 mths</th><th>21-24 mths</th><th>24-36 mths</th><th>36-48 mths</th><th>48 +</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Latest</td><td>2755</td><td>1224</td><td>946</td><td>501</td><td>485</td><td>393</td><td>397</td><td>353</td><td>1037</td><td>522</td><td>109</td><td>8722</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2875</td><td>1000</td><td>702</td><td>606</td><td>635</td><td>526</td><td>477</td><td>306</td><td>918</td><td>200</td><td>3</td><td>8248</td></tr></table></p></reply>

All the information provided to parents about vaccination takes into account the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL).</p>  <p>  The Patient Information Leaflet provides information on the vaccine, its uses and on any precautions that require advice from a healthcare professional before it is administered.  Therefore, like other countries providing school immunisation programmes, the Patient Information Leaflet is replaced by an information leaflet which provides the same information on the potential side effects of the vaccine in a manner that ensures that it is easily understood.</p>  <p>  The information is presented in clear and simple language which has been approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency, ensuring that it can be understood by all adults. The Health Information and Quality Authority guide &lsquo;Communicating in plain English&rsquo; (2015), developed in partnership with NALA, states that &ldquo;one in six people find reading and understanding everyday texts difficult: for example, reading a health leaflet, bus timetable or medicine instructions&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Prior to all school immunisations, parents receive an information pack in a sealed package with an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter. The information packs for all immunisations are standardised nationally. The information booklets include information on all the known potential side effects that can occur after each vaccination (as is the case with the HPV vaccine, Gardasil). Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.</p>  <p>  It is not the case that parents are being denied the information on the Patient Information Leaflet.  In fact, the HSE parent information leaflet refers parents to the HPV website (hpv.ie) where links to additional information including the licensing documentation, the Summary of Products Characteristics and the Patient Information Leaflet for each vaccine can be found. The HPV website has been endorsed by the World Health Organisation.</p>  <p>  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised in September 2006 both nationally and at EU level.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland. The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions through this system. All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the European Medicines Agency's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities.</p>  <p>  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  Gardasil is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information. The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and /or swelling at the point of injection and fever. These are usually mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination. Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents. Mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination are not unusual.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that all medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product. Taking into account the totality of the available information, the benefits of the HPV vaccines continue to outweigh their risks. The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.</p>  <p>  I would also like to reassure anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.</p>  <p>  I would urge any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination to engage with your family doctor, or alternatively to visit the HPV website.</p></reply>

Since then the HSE established a Rehabilitation Medicine Programme which aims to ensure the optimal care pathway for different clinical needs.  </p>  <p>  This Programme provides a national, strategic, and coordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services and includes the standardisation of access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services nationally as well as better linkages with primary care services. The scope of the Programme covers the whole of the patient journey from self-management and prevention through to primary, secondary and tertiary care. </p>  <p>  The Model of Care for Neurology was launched by the HSE in late 2016. This was developed by the HSE&rsquo;s National Clinical Programme for Neurology in collaboration with consultants, nurses, health and social care professionals and patient support groups. It aims to address the need for strategic development of neurology services in the provision of better care for these patients.</p>  <p>  In 2018 a number of significant investments were made for the diagnosis and treatment of a number of neurology related conditions. This year, funding has been allocated by the HSE to commence development of peri- and post-operative services to support patients receiving Deep Brain Stimulation. Also, additional funding has been allocated to further develop the national narcolepsy services, in particular the transition of adolescents from Children's University Hospital to St. James's Hospital.</p>  <p>  Other improvements across neurology services include the development of nurse led clinics, condition specific outpatient clinics and the development of links across specialties including stroke, old age medicine and genetics.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for all people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in assessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives. This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government and is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  I have also asked the HSE to reply to you directly.</p></reply>

The union which is recognised by the HSE for ambulance grades is SIPTU.  </p>  <p>  The NAS are monitoring the situation closely and are currently working on contingency plans to be put in place to minimise any disruption that may arise in January to ensure that patient safety is not compromised.  I am clear that industrial action is never the solution to industrial relations issues. The interests of patients are always best served through negotiation and by avoiding any such action.</p></reply>

The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

The availability of these services helps ensure the delivery of an optimum, safe service, particularly for high risk mothers and babies. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan 2018-2027 provide capital funding to support implementation of the Maternity Strategy, including the relocation of the Rotunda. I have been advised that the Rotunda hospital has prepared a Design Brief for the new facility. In addition, a Development Control Plan for the Connolly campus has been commissioned to support the orderly development of future capital projects on that campus, including the Maternity Hospital. As the project is at an early development stage, it would be premature to provide any indicative time frames for completion at this point.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects. Under the Scheme, fishermen active in the fishery could opt to voluntarily cease fishing in the commercial drift net and draft net sectors and undertake not to seek a licence in the future.  Payments to individuals were based on verifiable track record and recorded catches in the five years prior to its introduction. The average payment under the Scheme was almost &euro;23,000.  The Scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008 and all funds were expended.</p></reply>

To date my Department had been identifying eligible areas using a range of socio economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture, and stocking density.</p><p>From 2019, eligible areas must instead be designated using the following list of bio-physical criteria:</p><p>- Low  temperature</p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope</p><p>It is a requirement of EU regulations that &quot;compliance with those conditions shall be ensured at the level of local administrative units (LAU 2 level)&quot;. In line with this requirement, designation was completed at townland level. In addition, the condition of proximity or the contiguous nature of a townland with reference to other eligible townlands is not set out in the relevant EU Regulation as a criterion for eligibility.</p><p>The designation process has now been completed and in recent weeks I have published details in relation to the outcome and have completed a series of consultation meetings with key stakeholders.  </p><p>An independent appeals process is now in place for any farmers who wish to appeal the status of a particular townland following this process.  Farmers who hold land in townlands that are no longer eligible in 2019 are being written to, and included in this letter is an application form to begin the process of an appeal should they wish to take up this option.  This form is also available on the Department's website.  The appeals committee is chaired independently, and also has an independent technical expert.</p></reply>

The Authority is a statutorily independent regulator established by the that Act and I have no role in relation to its operations.     </p>  <p>  The Deputy's question refers to a number of matters and policy areas which are outside my remit. I do not have responsibility for political advertising on any other medium other than those referred to above. Questions in relation to the procurement of State advertising services should be directed to the Office of Government Procurement.</p>  <p>  In relation to the regulation of online political advertising, in March 2018 the Department of the Taoiseach established an interdepartmental group chaired by that Department on the security of the electoral process and disinformation. The other members of that group are the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government; Business, Enterprise and Innovation; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Defence; Foreign Affairs and Trade; and my own Department, along with the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Group published its first report in July, which recommended that Government seek to regulate transparency in Online Political Advertising. The report noted that this should be pursued in the first instance through consultation with all stakeholders. The Department of the Taoiseach conducted a public consultation in recent months, which informed the organisation of the Open Policy Forum on the regulation of transparency in political advertising which was held on 6 December 2018.</p>  <p>  The forum focussed on identifying and discussing possible policy solutions that respect the right to freedom of expression and relevant EU law while promoting the transparency necessary in a democracy that will protect our electoral processes from hidden influences and disinformation.</p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental group will now consider the submissions received to the public consultation, and the discussions which took place at the Forum.</p></reply>

The motion referred to by the Deputy recognised the commitment to protect the post office network in the Programme for a Partnership Government and called on the Government to undertake a number of actions to act on this commitment.    The Programme for Government envisaged that An Post, the Irish League of Credit Unions and other interested stakeholders would be asked to investigate and propose a new model of community banking, such as the Kiwibank model in New Zealand. The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to investigate the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks.</p>  <p>  A project team comprising officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Finance was established to progress this commitment.  The final report was published by the Minister for Finance and Minister for Rural and Community Development on 4 July 2018. The final report indicates that the Department of Finance will continue to engage in dialogue with Irish Rural Link and other stakeholders and that it will commission an independent external evaluation of ways in which the local public banking concept could possibly be promoted in Ireland. The Department of Rural and Community Development will continue to focus on rural and regional development generally and will provide a coordinating role across Government in relation to this priority area.</p>  <p>  As a result of the actions taken by Government, An Post has been able to construct and begin implementing a strategic plan for a sustainable future. Government remains fully committed to a sustainable post office network which is a key piece of economic and social infrastructure for both rural and urban areas. Reflecting its commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mails service, the Government made &euro;30m available in State funding to An Post to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service.</p>  <p>  There is widespread acceptance that the post office network requires modernisation to build, maintain and protect a service that meets the needs of communities across the country. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is about getting communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.  </p>  <p>An Post is already in the process of diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products; local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products.  In addition, a partnership with Avantcard announced in September will see personal loan services available in every post office across the country.</p></reply>

A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involved examining how best to support the development of the electric vehicle charging. The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focused on electric vehicles, is now complete and the progress report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Arising out of the work of the Taskforce, a grant of up to &euro;600 was introduced to support the installation of electric vehicle home chargers. Charging at home is the primary method of charging for the majority of electric vehicles both internationally and in Ireland. In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the SEAI, is also working on how best to support the provision of greater levels of on-street public charging. Funding for public charging in local communities can also be accessed through the Better Energy Communities Scheme. The scheme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), supports community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area. </p><p>  I announced the successful projects under the first Call for Applications Assessment Stage under the Climate Action Fund on 28 November.  I am delighted to have approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to a project from ESB eCars that will develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging network capable of facilitating large-scale electric vehicle uptake over the next decade. Further details on this project, and the other projects approved from the fund, are available on my Department's website at <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

This is a key political priority for me and the Government. The Taoiseach has described tackling child poverty as a moral imperative and this is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently. Under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020), my Department and other relevant Departments, are taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.</p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty. It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed.  My officials are working closely with that Department on this important issue.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the higher risks and life-long consequences of child poverty, the Government set a child-specific poverty target in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two-thirds on 2011 levels by 2020.</p>  <p>  When we set ourselves this target in 2014, it was a challenging ambition.  It aimed to lift 70,000 children out of poverty by 2020.  The baseline target against 2011 means that today we need to lift 102,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020.</p>  <p>  Consistent poverty means that these children are living in households with incomes below 60% of the national average income and experience deprivation according to official Government indicators.  Consistent poverty involves a diverse cohort of children and it is an issue that we are determined to resolve.</p>  <p>  We have made some modest progress.  From a peak of 152,000 children in consistent poverty in 2014, we have seen a 9% decrease in 2015 of 13,680 children in consistent poverty. This downward trend continued with an 11.1% rate of consistent poverty in 2016, a further reduction of 6,320 or 4.5%, with a total of 132,000 children deemed to be in a consistent poverty.  I understand that updated child poverty data (Survey on Income and Living Conditions data) for 2017 will be released by the Central Statistics  Office next Monday, 17th December.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the target to reduce child poverty by more than 100,000 children, or two thirds of the 2011 rate, is unlikely to be met. However, there is nothing inevitable about child poverty, and there is clear evidence about what works in terms of reducing child poverty rates. Ireland&rsquo;s historical approach to tackling child poverty has focused on cash transfers, and this approach has resulted in Ireland consistently ranking as one of the top performing EU countries in the poverty reduction effect of social transfers.</p>  <p>  The paper on the Whole-of-Government Approach to Tackling Child Poverty, which was published in October 2017, outlines six key priorities including;</p>  <p>  - Providing universal access to GP care for under 18s</p>  <p>  - Reducing the cost of education</p>  <p>  - Housing</p>  <p>  - Affordable childcare</p>  <p>  - Labour activation</p>  <p>  - Provision of in-work benefits. </p>  <p>  These priority actions are being advanced by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Health, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills, through the Better Outcomes, Brighter Future implementation structures. While the targets are increasingly challenging, we will continue our work across government on these priority actions to try to ensure that those most impacted by child poverty experience real and positive progress.</p></reply>

The internet is an increasingly valuable resource for everyone, including children and young people, but it also exposes people to new risks including cyberbullying.</p>  <p>  A range of Government Departments and agencies have a role in relation to internet safety both inside and outside of educational environments. In recognition of the whole of government approach required, in July 2018, the Taoiseach launched the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-19. The Action Plan involves a wide range of actions, across six Government Departments - Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health and Business Enterprise and Innovation, recognising that online safety is not the responsibility of any one Department and signifying the range and breadth of the issues involved. A Sponsors Group, involving the six Departments and chaired by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills, has been established to drive implementation of the Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Children First operates on the premise that it is the responsibility of everyone in society to keep children and young people safe from harm. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan for Online Safety my Department has committed to amending the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the completion of a Child Safeguarding Statement. An addendum to the guidance, clarifying the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements, is currently being finalised and will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website in the new year.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Child and Family Agency - Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.</p></reply>

These provide for the welfare of the child, including their health, education, assessment of need, care planning, supervision of placement, contact with family, general care practices, care records, and safety precautions. </p>  <p>  A range of accommodation is available to meet the needs of children at risk. Children and young people, depending on their identified needs, may be placed  in foster care, either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, high support or special care or other placement types. The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care. </p>  <p>  A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child's care placement, whether foster or residential care and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.</p>  <p>  All foster care services and statutory residential centres are subject to inspection by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA). Private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against National Standards. Inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by Department officials. The overview of these reports provides the Department with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children who are at risk.</p>  <p>  Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection, and is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians.  As of the 30 September 2018, of the children in care, 92% were in foster care nationally; there were 4,005 children in general foster care, 1,595 in relative care and 374 children were in a residential care placement, with the remaining children in other care placements appropriate to their assessed needs.</p>  <p>  There are regular area recruitment campaigns to meet foster care demands. Fostering teams are responsible for the recruitment and assessment of foster carers. When an assessment is complete, a report is presented to the Foster Care Committee who decide whether or not to approve the applicant.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and retention of an appropriate range of foster carers is part of Tusla's business plan. Tusla are particularly interested in recruiting foster carers with the skills required to look after children with complex needs, or from a range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds.</p>  <p>  For children who cannot live either at home or in an alternative family environment such as foster care, there are a number of types of residential care settings that may be appropriate, of which secure care is one type.</p>  <p>  A very small number of children (1.6%) are in other care placements.  Such placements can include supported lodgings, at home under a care order, detention centre/prison, youth homeless facilities, other residential centres e.g. therapeutic, disability, residential assessment, designated mother and baby units.</p>  <p>  It is a fact that sometimes children are detained for their safety in order to provide the care they need.  It is used only where a young person's behaviour poses a real and substantial risk of harm to their life, health, safety, development or welfare.  </p>  <p>  New regulations were put in place earlier this year.  These place special care on a full statutory footing for the first time.  The legislation sets a clear time limited and short term period for the use of special care.</p>  <p>  Staff working in special care are trained in a range of behaviour management techniques and in de-escalation. As far as possible, staff use the least restrictive practices they can to keep the children safe.  However, situations can arise where there is a risk of significant harm to self or to others and, in line with policy, may need the assistance of the Garda&iacute;.</p></reply>

The table below refers:</p><p><table><tr><th>Care Type</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>Returned home/with family</td><td>1,140</td><td>959</td><td>677</td></tr><tr><td>Remained with foster carers</td><td>115</td><td>267</td><td>330</td></tr><tr><td>Independent living</td><td>22</td><td>42</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Supported lodgings</td><td>7</td><td>50</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>76</td><td>102</td><td>157</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,360</td><td>1,420</td><td>1,224</td></tr></table></p><p>The figures above show that between 1200 and 1400 (approximately) children left care in each of the three years 2014 to 2017. Around 500 of these children left State care by virtue of reaching their majority. As illustrated above, 330 young adult remained with their former foster carers on leaving care. Ninety two percent of the total number of  children in care are placed with foster carers while the majority of those in residential care are aged between 12 and 17 years. </p><p>Where a young person under 18 is remaining in care, and is moving from residential care to another type of care placement, Tusla take steps to ensure that this transition takes place in a planned way. The young person's Care Plan is reviewed and updated as necessary, and the young person's social worker works with service providers to ensure that the transition is as minimally disruptive as possible. The views of the young person are taken into consideration, in keeping with their age and level of understanding.</p><p>Young people turning 18 and leaving care have an  aftercare plan prepared which outlines supports they may need.  Aftercare workers engage with young adults leaving care  to support them access these supports and to help them in their transitioning to adulthood.  </p><p>Children who return home from a residential placement, either by way of a Care Plan outcome or as directed by the Courts, will have an allocated social worker to supervise their care and safety. In some instances a Supervision Order may be granted by the Courts to support this process. </p><p>Tusla provides equal supports to children in residential care, irrespective of the ownership or management of the residential centre in which they are placed.</p></reply>

Specifically, section 22(3) sets out how a person other than a husband may be registered as father of the child. </p>  <p>  In this particular case section 23(3)(a) applies, as there is no decree of divorce, deed of nullity, or deed of separation. Under these provisions the husband must sign a statutory declaration rebutting paternity in order for the mother to avail of this provision.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, it is open to the individual concerned to apply for a Court Order under Section 45 of the Status of Children Act 1987 naming the person other than the husband as the father of the child. Upon receipt of this court order, the birth will be registered with the named person as the father of the child in accordance with section 22(2)(d).</p>  <p>  The individual concerned also raised questions in relation to the appropriateness of the current legislation. In this context I can inform the Deputy of the following, although it would not have any application in this case as the provisions are not retrospective:</p>  <p>  Section 6 of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 amends Section 22 to make it possible, in certain circumstances, for a person other than the mother&rsquo;s husband to be registered as the father of the child without any of the decrees, deeds or court order mentioned above.  These provisions, however, remain to be commenced pending agreement from HSE to the roll-out of training to staff of the Civil Registration Service, who are employees of the HSE.</p>  <p>  The General Register Office (GRO) is in a position to provide this training as soon as the HSE notifies it of the dates and venues. Work has been ongoing to progress this matter and as a result an advance party attended a session over the summer. It is not possible, at present, to indicate a date for the full roll out of training but it is hoped that this can be commenced shortly. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, the GRO, the Department of Health, and the HSE are maintaining their best efforts to ensure that commencement of this legislation can be brought about as soon as possible.</p>  <p>   I will arrange for officials from my Department to contact the Deputy to follow up in relation to the circumstances outlined in this matter.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area, including Cavan and Monaghan, is underway.

Publication of the guidelines, which were called for widely in the wider planning and development sector, followed a period of public consultation and consideration of over 100 submissions and a thorough assessment by my Department.</p><p>The development of the guidelines specifically addressed their application to areas covered by Strategic Development Zone Planning Schemes, and therefore the SDZ aspects were fully considered. SDZs can be reviewed at any stage by their respective development agencies to reflect changing implementation and policy circumstances and development agencies frequently go through these review mechanisms.  </p><p>Accordingly, I do not anticipate significant delays in SDZ implementation as a result of these guidelines which are also focused on securing the best strategic planning outcomes for generations to come as well as addressing issues of a more immediate nature. </p><p>The guidelines build upon the strategic policy framework set out in Project Ireland 2040 and the National Planning Framework. In particular the guidelines:</p><p>- develop policy outlined in  the National Planning Framework, in particular National Policy Objectives 1 and 13;</p><p>- outline wider and strategic policy considerations and performance criteria that planning authorities should apply, alongside their statutory development plans, in assessing proposals for taller buildings; and</p><p>- support the accommodation of anticipated population growth and development needs, whether for housing, employment or other purposes, by building up and consolidating the development of our existing urban areas. </p><p>A copy of the Guidelines and associated Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Statement, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p>and </p><p>The SEA Statement has been prepared as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the Guidelines in accordance with the relevant national and EU legislation. This document provides information on the decision-making process and records how environmental considerations have been integrated into the Guidelines. Furthermore it summarises how the SEA environmental report and submissions and observations made by the public and designated statutory consultees have been taken into account during the preparation of the Guidelines.  </p><p>In determining planning policy and making planning decisions around appropriate building heights, the planning process has to strike a careful balance between on the one hand enabling long-term and strategic development of relevant areas, while ensuring the highest standards of urban design, architectural quality and place-making outcomes on the other.  I am satisfied that these guidelines are necessary and appropriate to give clear context and direction to the overall requirement to promote increased density and building height in appropriate locations within our urban centres.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-13a.624.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121300067#WRK04400"><p>In line with general practice for peat extraction, a rolling series of survey work, investigation and excavations have been carried out at Mayne Bog over a number of years.  In 2006, with the co-operation of the landowners, my Department commissioned a full survey of the then known togher (constructed of planks) followed by the excavation of a single cutting across the togher.  During the course of this excavation, a second togher (of brushwood construction) was identified slightly to the north of the plank togher and running parallel to it. This was also fully surveyed and recorded. </p>  <p>   In 2013, the landowners commissioned an environmental impact statement in connection with a peat extraction licence application to the Environmental Protection Agency. As part of the assessment process, the peatlands were fully examined by a qualified archaeological consultant and, aside from the plank togher, no further finds or features of archaeological significance were identified at that time. </p>  <p>  In 2014, at my Department&rsquo;s request, another inspection was commissioned by the landowners to assess the status of both toghers.  During 2015, and also at the request of my Department, the landowners commissioned a series of excavations which were carried out at three separate locations on both toghers.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, with the permission of the landowners, my Department commissioned an Induced Polarisation Survey (an advanced geophysical technique) to examine an area of high bog to the east of the open industrial bog at Mayne. This methodology was previously used successfully at Edercloon, County Longford, to identify wooden structures outside the road corridor where other parts of the structures were under excavation by the National Roads Authority.  Due to the heavily waterlogged nature of the high bog at Mayne, the geophysical survey was inconclusive in tracking the togher into the higher peatlands. During 2017, my Department commissioned a further survey using metal probes inserted through the peat, as developed and employed successfully in research at C&eacute;ide Fields in North Mayo.  The survey successfully identified that the togher continues to the east from the edge of the high bog for a minimum distance of 200 metres at depths from the surface varying from 1 to 2.4 metres. </p>  <p>  In the course of 2018 my Department licensed a further assessment by the landowners of the archaeological potential of the area of the bog that is subject to peat extraction.  The fieldwork component of this project has been completed and under the conditions of the licence, the archaeologist is obliged to submit a report to the Department's National Monuments Service which will be shared with the local authority. </p>  <p>  My Department also hopes to commission a further survey in 2019 of the area of Mayne Bog which has not been subject to peat extraction, with a view to further clarifying the location and state of preservation of the area of trackway in that part of the bog.  The Department is and will continue to engage with all stakeholders, including the local authority and the landowners, to progress the preservation of the togher in the high bog. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the measures being taken with regard to the protection of the toghers uncovered at Mayne represent the best approach to securing an optimal outcome. Unlike cases involving delivery of key infrastructure which are supported by the Codes of Practice agreed and in place between my Department and the various State utility providers, archeological discoveries arising from private development have to be dealt with on a case by case basis. In such instances the practice is to seek the co-operation of private landowners with the protection and recording of monuments in line, for example, with my Department&rsquo;s engagement with farmers under Glas, the current agri-environmental scheme.  Such engagement is undertaken in a collaborative and transparent manner and I am satisfied that it is proving to be the best mechanism for guaranteeing the survival of these monuments into the future.</p></reply>
