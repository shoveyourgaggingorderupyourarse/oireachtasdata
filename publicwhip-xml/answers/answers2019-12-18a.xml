Earlier this month I visited Israel and Palestine for the fourth time in the last two years. I have also consistently engaged on this issue at EU and UN level. In February at Farmleigh, I hosted important discussions on the MEPP with a small group of EU and Arab foreign ministers, with whom I continue to discuss how we can contribute to the process of delivering a lasting peace.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that Ireland will &ldquo;honour our commitment to recognise the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict.&rdquo; Successive Governments have seen recognition coming in the context of an overall peace agreement. In the context of widespread frustration at the lack of political progress towards an agreement, and not least in light of the views expressed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in 2014, we have discussed here in the Oireachtas the question of whether the formal recognition of Palestine, in advance of its full achievement on the ground, would be a helpful step in advancing a resolution of the Israel- Palestine conflict. </p>  <p>  One of the many factors bearing on this question is the importance of assessing whether recognition now would positively affect the peace process or merely be viewed as a symbolic gesture, swiftly overtaken and surpassed by events on the ground. Recognition by Ireland outside the context of an overall peace agreement would also undoubtedly affect Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing influence on the Middle East Peace Process at EU and international level, and it is imperative that such a step would not diminish Ireland&rsquo;s impact without delivering a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people. </p>  <p>  I have stated that I will be ready to recommend immediate recognition to the Government, if and when I believe it would be helpful in achieving our objective of a free and sovereign Palestinian State, or advancing the peace process in that direction. I have taken a conscious decision not to recommend recognition at this time, as I am aware of how it would negatively impact on the good access we have had to date with all parties, and on our capacity to influence the situation. I would ask the Deputy to trust my judgement, given my personal commitment on this issue.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-18a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800075#WRA01000"><p>The human rights situation in Bahrain remains a matter of concern. Although progress has been made in certain areas, there continue to be instances of violations of fundamental freedoms, including the targeting of human rights defenders.  </p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important and Ireland regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, both in national statements and in our support of EU Statements. </p>  <p>  Our principled stance on human rights feeds into our bilateral dialogue. When I met the Bahraini Foreign Minister at the UN General Assembly in New York in September, I made a point of raising the human rights situation directly with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. In addition, officials from my Department meet regularly with advocacy groups and Bahraini human rights defenders to discuss the situation in Bahrain. </p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has signed five joint statements at the Human Rights Council on the human rights situation in Bahrain, which expressed concern on a number of fronts including the mistreatment of detainees and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality without due process. No decision has yet been taken on national or EU interventions at the next session of the the Human Rights Council, which will commence in late February 2020.  When planning for this session, we will consider carefully which priorities to set, with a view to focusing the weight of Ireland's efforts, and the Council's attention, on the most grave and troubling situations globally.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, including at the Human Rights Council, whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

Citizens and their elected representatives should, of course, be free to work to change laws but this must be through the appropriate constitutional channels.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s position is that the constitutional and political arrangements in Spain are matters to be determined by their own citizens, through their own institutions and in keeping with the rule of law.</p><p>The balance between the freedom to demonstrate and the need for law and order must be protected so that people can go about their normal lives. That is why the Government continues to support a resolution to the current situation that is based on democracy and the rule of law.</p><p>We respect to the separation of powers in Spain, as we do in Ireland, and so it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the judicial process involving any individuals there.</p><p>The question of independence is deeply divisive in Catalonia.  It is important that the voices of all Catalans are fully heard and represented, including those who do not support independence.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach spoke with Prime Minister Johnson on Friday last and they will meet in person as soon as is possible.  For my part, I look forward to meeting with my counterpart, the UK Foreign Secretary, early in 2020, to discuss mutual interests and shared global challenges.  </p><p>I have been working very closely with one UK colleague - the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith - in the last number of days.  We are resolute in our determination to see the restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement but time is very short, and so we are working hard, with the political parties in Northern Ireland, to find agreement.  This is a matter of utmost urgency, and one on which Irish and British partnership is, and will continue to be, vital. </p><p>  The overall relationship with the newly elected UK Government is a top priority for both myself and the Taoiseach.  Given our joint stewardship of the peace process, our people-to-people relations, and our economic and trading relationship, it's clear that we will need to establish and maintain close, collaborative relationships with our UK counterparts now and for the coming years.  We need to ensure that the &ldquo;habit of cooperation&rdquo; that has developed through so many years working side by side as members of the European Union is maintained following the UK's departure.</p><p>Regular engagement, facilitated by existing structures like the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council, will be key in this regard.  We will also discuss with the UK as soon as is possible whether new structures for cooperation between Dublin and London will also be required.</p><p>I and my colleagues will also continue to engage closely with the devolved administrations in both Cardiff and Edinburgh in order to strengthen relationships between and within these islands at every level, in what will be a new and challenging context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-18a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800075#WRA01700"><p>The Government has been actively preparing for Brexit for more than two years to make sure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for all scenarios.  This has the highest priority across Government, and involves every Government Department and key Agencies, in tandem with the EU. </p>  <p>  Actions we took during this time included passing key legislation to protect our citizens and support the economy, enterprise and jobs, in key sectors. We held over 1,200 stakeholder preparedness events across the country.  The Government invested in the physical and ICT capacity at our ports and airports.  We contacted over 102,000 businesses that traded with the UK in 2018 and 2019 and provided a wide range of business supports for enterprise and the agri-food sector including  training and financial supports.  All this work was supported by a broad range of TV, radio, print and social media information campaigns. </p>  <p>  The Contingency Action Plan Update published by Government in July 2019 provided a comprehensive overview of no deal Brexit preparations and mitigation measures. Since the extension of the Brexit process, first to 31 October 2019 and then until 31 January 2020, this work has been further developed and refined.</p>  <p>  Following the UK General Election and Prime Minister Johnson's stated intention to proceed as soon as possible with ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement, the risk of a no deal exit on 31 January 2020 has been considerably reduced.  However, it remains the case that, until the ratification process is completed, a no deal scenario cannot be formally ruled out and our preparedness work continues.</p>  <p>  Brexit of any kind will mean change for Government, business and citizens. The level of this change will be dependent on the status of EU-UK negotiations at the end of the transition period.    </p>  <p>  Given the range of possible outcomes, the Government will continue its preparedness and contingency planning work during the transition period. The planning already undertaken and lessons learned to date from our no deal preparations will remain valuable. A number of areas will require ongoing attention as they will be affected in any Brexit scenario. These include ongoing work to upgrade infrastructure at our ports and airports, business readiness for different scenarios including supports for the most impacted sectors and  ensuring Irish exporters can continue to use the Landbridge effectively.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-18a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800075#WRA01900"><p>The expected date of the election for the two available seats in the Western European and Others Group for the UN Security Council term 2021-2022 is June 2020.  Canada and Norway, who are committed members of the UN and important bilateral partners of Ireland, are also competing for seats.  Ireland last served on the Council from 2001-2002.</p>  <p>  In making our case to the 192 other Members States of the UN, we are focusing on Ireland&rsquo;s consistent record at the UN during more than six decades of active membership, in particular in the areas of peacekeeping, sustainable development, humanitarian action, disarmament and human rights.  More broadly, we have sought to highlight the values and principles that underpin Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and will characterise our contribution to the work of the Security Council.  At a time when it is under pressure, the importance we attach to securing a seat on the Security Council demonstrates to our international partners Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to the multilateral system.</p>  <p>  As we enter the final phase of the campaign, we can expect our competitors to intensify their lobbying efforts.  All appropriate regional, multilateral and bilateral engagements are therefore being utilised to give profile to our candidature.  In September, I travelled to the 74th session of the UN General Assembly with the President, the Taoiseach and other members of the Government.  Our programmes included a significant number of bilateral meetings with senior representatives of other States and Governments, where our strong case for a seat on the Security Council was pressed.  Earlier this month, my attendance at the 26th Ministerial Council of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) presented an important opportunity to brief counterparts from across the European neighbourhood on Ireland&rsquo;s candidature. I also attended the meeting of EU and Asian Foreign Ministers in Madrid this week and promoted Ireland's candidature in my meetings with counterparts. </p>  <p>  This campaign is a priority for the Government.  The Taoiseach, I as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ministers and Ministers of State across Government - and our officials - will continue to engage intensively with international partners to ensure success in what is a very competitive election.</p></reply>

Over the last year, the proposal has been discussed at working level in the EU. These discussions have focused on the intended objective and scope of the proposed regime, and how to ensure its compatibility with existing, geographically based, sanctions regimes.   </p>  <p>  At our meeting on 9 December, Foreign Ministers concluded that there is now sufficient support for the initiative to move forward. The High Rrepresentative and VP, Josep Borrell, will task the EU External Action Service (EEAS) to produce a non-paper to commence the process. </p>  <p>  I intervened in the discussion to support the establishment of a new EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime. I believe it will be an important addition to the EU's human rights toolbox. Ireland will be engaging actively in the discussions at EU level in the coming months which we hope will result in the formal establishment of the new regime and we look forward to receiving the EEAS non-paper. </p>  <p>   A key goal should be to deter and prevent human rights abuses from taking place.  We will also want to ensure that the regime is fully compatable with, and complementary to, existing geographic sanction regimes.</p></reply>

This was my fourth visit to Israel and Palestine as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I met with key representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as UN officials from UNRWA, UNTSO and OHCHR.</p>  <p>  On the Israeli side I met Prime Minister Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Katz. In both meetings, I set out Ireland&rsquo;s deep concerns about the impact of the continuing occupation, including the situation in Gaza, settlement construction and the demolition of properties in the West Bank and actions taken against Palestinians in East Jerusalem. I also raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the erosion of civil society space, and the importance of ensuring that there are no impediments to the holding of Palestinian elections.</p>  <p>  I had a frank discussion with Prime Minister Netanyahu about actions taken by Israel over recent years which are jeopardising the viability of a two-state solution and thus the prospect of a just and lasting solution to the conflict for both peoples. I specifically raised comments he had made about annexation of the Jordan Valley. I also raised Ireland&rsquo;s well known view that settlements are illegal under international law. Although I am very conscious of the specific impact of the settlement announcment in relation to Hebron, given the gravity and extent of settlement activity, I focused on giving strong messages on Ireland's opposition, as a matter of principle, to all settlement activity. I stressed the urgent need to address the unsustainable situation in Gaza.</p>  <p>  On the Palestinian side, I met with President Mahmoud Abbas, Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh and Dr. Saeb Erekat, Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. I also met with the Palestinian Minister for Education, Dr. Marwan Awartani, and signed a memorandum of understanding which outlined Irish support for the Palestinian education sector, and met with Minister Mazen Ghuneim, head of the Palestinian Water Authority. In these meetings I conveyed the importance the Irish people attach to the resolution of the Middle East Peace Process, something that has been a priority for me personally since I took office, supported the intention to hold elections, and discussed how Ireland and the EU can play a constructive role in the MEPP. </p>  <p>  During my visit to Gaza, I met with secondary school students from an UNRWA school in Jabalia, where I saw first-hand the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to supporting quality education for children.  I also met with senior UNRWA officials and discussed the humanitarian situation in the Gaza strip and the operational challenges facing the agency. I was pleased to announce that Ireland will provide an additional &euro;2.5 million in funding this year to support the delivery of these core services, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total support to UNRWA in 2019 to &euro;7.5 million.</p>  <p>  I also visited the Northern Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment (NGEST) where I met with Minister Mazen Ghunaim to formally launch Ireland&rsquo;s investment in support of the water sector. Ireland will contribute &euro;8.8 million to a joint project with France to build a solar power plant providing clean, reliable energy to the NGEST wastewater treatment plant. Water pollution is the leading cause of child mortality in Gaza. </p>  <p>  In respect of plans for new settlement construction in Hebron, my view is clear; any further settlement expansion would be deeply regrettable and would be likely to accentuate tensions in an already fragile situation. This is particularly the case following the Israeli Government&rsquo;s decision earlier this year not to renew the mandate of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron, which had played an important role in preventing violence. My officials will use appropriate opportunities to highlight Ireland's strong opposition to any settlement construction in Hebron.   </p>  <p>  I will continue to work to ensure that the Middle East Peace Process remains high on the international agenda. At the last meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 9 December in Brussels, I briefed EU Foreign Ministers on my visit, and in follow-up to the issues I raised, the FAC will discuss the Middle East Peace Process in more detail at its next meeting in January.</p></reply>

Ireland actively contributes through the appropriate mechanisms to ensure that all Member States respect shared European values and fundamental rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland has engaged in the ongoing Article 7 procedure on rule of law in Poland and Hungary, and in broader discussions on the Rule of Law, at the General Affairs Council. </p>  <p>  Most recently, Ireland participated in the second hearing on rule of law in Hungary, at the 10 December General Affairs Council. Ireland joined fellow Member States in questioning Hungary on rule of law issues. Ireland focused on the issue of academic freedom and on the Central European University. The Commission also briefed Ministers on the ongoing state of play regarding the rule of law in Poland.  </p>  <p>  We believe that the Article 7 process should continue but we should consider all of the instruments we have at our disposal to uphold the values of the Union. </p>  <p>  In November, the Court of Justice of the European Union made two rulings on rule of law issues in Poland. We respect the rulings of the Court of Justice of the EU and encourage Poland to continue to engage and address the concerns that have been raised.</p>  <p>  At the 19 November General Affairs Council Member States reviewed the annual rule of law dialogue and discussed a set of conclusions on the issue. As there was no consensus between Member States on the text, Presidency conclusions were issued. Ireland supported the Presidency conclusions. </p>  <p>  It is important that any new mechanisms to uphold the rule of law should be inclusive, non-burdensome and avoid duplication of efforts under existing mechanisms, and that each Member State should continue to be treated equally.</p></reply>

The agreement is robust and comprehensive, consisting of three main pillars: Political Dialogue, Cooperation and Sectoral Policy Dialogue, and Trade and Trade Cooperation.  </p>  <p>  The trade pillar is aimed at strengthening EU-Cuba trade and economic relations by promoting dialogue, encouraging increased trade and investment flows, promoting the integration of Cuba into the world economy, and supporting the diversification of the Cuban economy.</p>  <p>  Ireland was pleased to ratify the EU Cuba PDCA earlier this year, marking a significant moment in our bilateral relationship with Cuba, which has been strengthening in recent years. In October this year, President Miguel D&iacute;az-Canel visited Ireland and met with President Higgins and the Taoiseach, returning a visit by President Higgins to Cuba in 2017. I understand that the Taoiseach had a positive and constructive meeting with President D&iacute;az-Canel and that they discussed several issues of mutual concern, including ways in which both countries can improve trade and economic links. </p>  <p>  While current trade levels between Ireland and Cuba are relatively low, the enactment of the PDCA and the growing level of bilateral engagement between our two countries will facilitate the strengthening of economic relations and increased trade. President D&iacute;az-Canel was accompanied on his visit to Dublin by Minister for Foreign Trade and Investment, Rodrigo Malmierca, a signal of the importance our two countries place on expanding relations in this area. Real progress in this area will materialise as Cuba continues its necessary programme of domestic economic reforms to open up its economy.</p>  <p>  Ireland's Embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Cuba, has been engaging with the Cuban Government regarding the potential to increase economic cooperation. Our Ambassador has made several trips to Cuba this year, including a trade-focused visit in November, when she attended the Havana Trade Fair and met President D&iacute;az-Canel, Vice-Minister for Trade, Ileana N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Mordoche, and relevant government officials to discuss ways to expand bilateral economic and trade links. </p>  <p>  Ireland looks forward to further dialogue with Cuba across the areas outlined in the PDCA and to continuing work to strengthen diplomatic, political and economic ties between our two countries.</p></reply>

In its final report published on 4 December, the OAS stated that there was intentional manipulation and serious irregularities in the electoral process, making it impossible to validate the results. </p>  <p>  The elections were followed by weeks of mass protests and reports of violence across Bolivia. I supported numerous EU statements over those weeks calling for an end to violence, peaceful negotiations and a credible electoral process. Since the departure of former President Morales to Mexico on 12 November, an interim Government headed by Jeanine &Aacute;&ntilde;ez has taken up office to allow for the holding of fresh elections. </p>  <p>  At the FAC meeting on 9 December, the EU's High Representative Josep Borrell briefed Ministers on recent developments, as well as on the EU&rsquo;s ongoing work locally with the Catholic Church and UN in mediating political discussion between the Bolivian parties.

In the past few weeks, a number of significant arrests have taken place and allegations have been made against senior Government officials. This has resulted in a number of resignations from the Government and the announcement by the Prime Minister of Malta that he will step down as his party leader on 12 January 2020 and as Prime Minister shortly afterwards. </p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners have condemned in unequivocal terms the murder of Ms Caruana Galizia, which represents an attack on freedom of expression; a fundamental right in any democracy. It is essential for a healthy democracy that journalists feel safe to pursue their work, free from the threat of intimidation, harassment and violence.</p>  <p>  Together with EU partners, we have called for a thorough and independent investigation into the murder of Ms Caruana Galizia. In a case such as this, it is vitally important that there is trust in the integrity of the investigation and the primacy of the rule of law. </p>  <p>  Together with the representatives of several other EU member states, Ireland will continue to actively monitor the situation. Our Ambassador in Malta has attended the public inquiry into Ms Caruana Galizia&rsquo;s murder, which started in early December. The Ambassador has also met with family members of Ms Caruana Galizia. </p>  <p>  It is my firm hope that the recent developments in the investigation will soon lead to those responsible for this appalling crime being apprehended and swiftly brought to justice.</p></reply>

I have also expressed my sympathies to the people and Government of Sri Lanka in relation to the horrific bombing attacks on Easter Sunday. </p>  <p>  I was encouraged by the EU Election Observation Mission&rsquo;s findings that the recent election process was peaceful overall and that the fundamental freedoms and rights of Sri Lanka&rsquo;s citizens were largely respected.  I am further encouraged by President Rajapaksa's commitment, following his election, to be a &ldquo;President for all Sri Lankans&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  I hope that the new Government will continue to make progress on its predecessors&rsquo; commitments to the relevant UN Human Rights Council Resolutions, most recently resolution 40/1 in 2019, all of which Ireland co-sponsored. These Resolutions encourage the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to undertake a comprehensive approach to dealing with the past and to the promotion of reconciliation, accountability and the protection of human rights.  </p>  <p>  I am glad to see that the EU has recently announced the launch of new projects in Sri Lanka that will support human rights and civil society there. The "Search for Common Ground" project in particular works to "promote cooperative engagement across traditional dividing lines in Sri Lanka to create a more inclusive national identity". In addition, the EU Commission&rsquo;s Annual Action Programme focused particularly on promoting mechanisms of engagement between local groups and between citizens and the Government to mitigate the risk of a return to conflict. It made provisions for the funding and support of the development of reconciliation and development roles in local authorities and the strengthening of local mediation boards.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to voice its support, within both the EU and the UN, for reconciliation and accountability for human rights violations during the civil war in Sri Lanka.</p></reply>

The Political Declaration on the Future Relationship sets out the parameters for an ambitious, broad, deep and felxible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, centered on a Free Trade Agreement, but also including broader sectoral and strategic engagement. </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently supported the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, in the interests of Ireland, North and South, and British-Irish relations, as well as in terms of our economic and trading priorities.  We also have signigicant interests in ensuring adequate level playing field provisions to facilitate fair competition.  </p>  <p>  The administrative approach to implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland will be clarified during the transition period.  The EU and UK will work together in the Joint Committee to provide further detail on how the Protocol works in practice. Ireland will play our part constructively, as an EU Member State, to make sure that these processes work for the island of Ireland, including in respect of the all-island economy, North-South co-operation and the ongoing protection of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

The Directive was transposed into Irish law through the European Union (Disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups) Regulations 2017, which were amended by the European Union (Disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups) (Amendment) Regulations 2018.</p>  <p>  Other relevant international mechanisms in this context include the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration on Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. </p></reply>

This is the most recent iteration of the draft proposal by successive Presidencies in these complex negotiations, which are likely to continue well into 2020. The Presidency has proposed an overall level of 1.07% of EU27 GNI for the next MFF period 2021-2027 and has maintained or slightly increased the allocations for Cohesion and CAP, which are priority areas for Ireland. To maintain CAP and Cohesion spending at the level proposed by the Commission, the Presidency has proposed adjustments to a range of other programmes. At the GAC, Member States expressed a range of views on the proposals according to their particular priorities, including in relation to the proposed overall amount, the distribution of funding across different areas and the possible sources of revenue for the MFF. Following discussion at the GAC, the Presidency presented the revised Negotiating Box to the December European Council. The Heads of State and Government called on the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, to take the negotiations forward with the aim of reaching a final agreement. Ireland continues to take a constructive approach in the MFF negotiations. We remain open to increasing our contribution to the budget from current levels provided European Added Value is ensured and our core interests are met, including maintaining funding for CAP.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. To date almost half of the fleet have been upgraded with the remainder due by early 2022. Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles (AUVs) were acquired in 2017, and in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures will provide essential force protection overseas. A capability requirement for additional AUVs has been identified. Additional funding has been allocated for this project and a procurement process is expected to begin in early 2020.</p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2019 a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3/4 tonne 4 X4 vehicles, the first of which are expected to enter service in early 2020. A tender process is underway also for the supply of new 4 X 4 Troop Carrying Vehicles. It is expected that a contract will be awarded in 2020. Funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with three larger and more capable fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance). It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020. In addition, planning is also in progress to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft and a tender competition has recently concluded in this regard, with the award of a contract to Airbus Defence and Space for the provision of two new C-295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft for the Air Corps. The new aircraft are scheduled for delivery in 2023. </p>  <p>  The on-going Naval Service ship replacement programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to investment in the Naval Service. Three new Offshore Patrol Vessels were delivered between 2014 and 2017 with the fourth, the L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, delivered in late 2018. The Mid-Life Extension Programme of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n commenced in March 2019, with an initial dry-docking phase, followed by an extended period of equipment upgrade and refit works. L&Eacute; Niamh&rsquo;s extension programme is due to commence in 2020. In addition, planning is ongoing for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel. </p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment.</p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was been increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) and Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) roles. Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  In respect of terrorism, responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In that regard, among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2015) is the provision of ATCP which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. There is on-going and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies. Regular coordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. The Defence Forces also participate in counter-terrorism training initiatives with international forces on an on-going basis.</p>  <p>  I also wish to assure you that the Defence Forces retain a wide range of specialist skills and equipment. The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any emergencies that may arise. The Operations Directorate in Defence Forces Headquarters manages the necessary cross-service coordination in responding to requests for support. These arrangements have proved effective in all emergencies encountered to date.</p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process and I wish to assure you that significant investment in equipment is taking place in the coming years in this context. </p>  <p>  With regard to training, the primary function of training and education in the Defence Forces is to develop and maintain the necessary capabilities. The Defence Forces deliver military training programmes and modules meeting national and international standards. They also engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retain currency with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be equipped and trained to best international standards and I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats and emergencies under constant review. I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are equipped and resourced to respond, as appropriate, to any such events were they to occur in this State.</p></reply>

Improvements within the economy have provided an opportunity for the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay cuts across the Public Service.</p><p>Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p><p>The increases due to date under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, have been paid to members of the Defence Forces, the most recent being a 1.75% increase on annualised salaries from the 1 September 2019. On 1 January 2020 annualised salaries up to &euro;32,000 will increase by 0.5% and on 1 October 2020 annualised salaries will increase by 2%.</p><p>By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the payscales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p><p>The Report of the Public Service Pay Commission on Recruitment and Retention in the Defence Forces was accepted by Government on 4 July 2019.  The Report contains a broad range of recommendations which include:</p><p>- a 10% increase in Military Service Allowance,</p><p>- the restoration to pre-Haddington Road Agreement levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances,</p><p>- the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps.</p><p>The increase in Military Service Allowance and the restoration of the rates of the other allowances, as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission, have been paid and are in addition to measures relating to core pay which are in the current Public Service Stability Agreement.</p><p>In accepting the report of the Public Service Pay Commission, the Government also approved a plan Strengthening Our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase 1, to implement the recommendations in the report. The Plan provides for further measures in the short, medium and longer term. </p><p>As the actions being progressed have a range of timeframes, the full impact of the proposals will take time to determine.

However, as noted in the White Paper Update, there is continuing potential for additional investment in military facilities and, with this in mind, a focussed five year infrastructure programme will be launched in January 2020. This will provide the means to channel available funds to where these will have the strongest impact, while acknowledging the potential for additional investment.   </p>  <p>  The Update was undertaken while Brexit has continued to evolve. The Update notes that the precise security implications of Brexit remain hard to predict, albeit that the overall setting in which security resides may be adversely impacted. It is not clear, at this point, that any particular implications call for a defence response beyond what is committed in the White Paper. Prudent planning remains the essential relevant focus against the backdrop of the current position on Brexit, and the responsibility, in the first instance, of the Department of Justice and Equality, along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for internal security matters and the Revenue Commissioners for customs issues.   </p>  <p>  Overall, I am pleased with the outcome of the White Paper Update and I am satisfied that the Defence Forces will continue to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

The decommissioned vessel L&Eacute; Aisling was withdrawn from service in 2016 after being in service since 1980 having well exceeded her notional life expectancy. In engineering terms, the equipment onboard was obsolete and the reliability and capability of the ship was impacted. In order for the Naval Service to carry out its roles as assigned by Government the fleet must be capable, reliable and safe to operate in the often hostile North Atlantic where sea conditions during prolonged winter storms are not exceeded anywhere in the world.</p>  <p>  Following her decommissioning in 2016, I made the decision to sell the former L&Eacute; Aisling by way of public auction to the highest bidder to maximise the return to the Exchequer. This is in keeping with the Department's standing policy for the disposal of surplus defensive equipment. This approach is also in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2015 Report which provides that &ldquo;a competitive sales process or auction should normally be used for the disposal of State assets with a significant market value.  Such a process helps to ensure transparency and is more likely to achieve the fair market price.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  All weaponry systems, defensive equipment and specialist Naval equipment were removed in their entirety from the decommissioned vessel prior to the sale. The main weapon consisted of the L70 Bofors 40mm crew served cannon which was complemented by two 20mm auto cannons. All of these were directly attached to the deck and were removed in their entirety from the vessel. In accordance with Maritime law this means that the ship was no longer classified as a warship. There were no armaments or offensive military capability on board this vessel to sell or to export.  </p>  <p>  The sale of the decommissioned vessel was by way of a public auction, it was fully transparent and was open to all interested parties. The vessel was sold on an "as seen" basis to a Dutch shipbroker in March 2017, and was removed from the Naval Base in Haulbowline and towed to Holland by the purchaser. </p>  <p>  Once the decommissioned vessel was sold to the Dutch buyer, my Department ceased to have any trailing obligations in relation to the vessel and had no role or responsibility with regard to the future use of the vessel or the future supply chain for this vessel. The resale of the decommissioned vessel was a matter for the Dutch buyer and any subsequent resale onwards and compliance with UN arms embargoes was a matter for other State authorities.</p></reply>

The White Paper on Defence &ndash; Update 2019, which I published last week following Government approval, is the first in a new fixed cycle of defence reviews which the Government decided to introduce when it approved the White Paper in 2015. The Update follows the approach set out in the White Paper.  It provides that these reviews are to consider progress made since 2015 and any revisions required.  Further, these reviews are to encompass a fully updated assessment of the security environment with a fresh consideration of implications for overall policy requirements, associated tasks, capability development and resourcing.</p>  <p>  As part of this, the Update includes a comprehensive review of overall progress with White Paper implementation. Since publication of the White Paper, a total of 95 separate projects have been identified for completion over a ten-year period. Included in the Update is a full breakdown of the current status of all projects and actions as well as a full report, on a chapter by chapter basis, of the outcome of the review of implementation. (The Update is available to download on my Department&rsquo;s website.) </p>  <p>  Implementation of all actions and projects is being carried out by civil-military teams on a phased basis over a ten-year period out to 2025 and is receiving continuous joint civil/military oversight of progress. All of the actions or projects are being implemented in addition to the substantial body of work conducted by the civil and military elements of the Department of Defence on a daily basis. </p>  <p>  To provide flexibility, projects may be sub-divided or merged, changing the top-line number. Currently,  the number to be implemented stands at 95, with this number subject to further change as the process evolves. 42 of these projects have been initiated with 15 closed and others due to close shortly. The White Paper Update and the Government&rsquo;s High Level Plan to implement the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission will result in reprioritisation of certain projects.  </p>  <p>  Implementation on a phased basis is necessary in order to reflect Programme for a Partnership Government and Strategy Statement commitments, the related nature of some projects and resourcing implications. </p>  <p>  While it is currently intended to have all projects initiated or completed by the end of the ten year implementation programme, work in certain areas will continue beyond 2025 in order to ensure that changes, improvements and actions envisaged in the White Paper are sustained and that the positive outcomes endure and are embedded in the day to day business of the Defence Organisation.</p></reply>

This is the most recent iteration of the draft proposal by successive Presidencies in these complex negotiations, which are likely to continue well into 2020. The Presidency has proposed an overall level of 1.07% of EU27 GNI for the next MFF period 2021-2027 and has maintained or slightly increased the allocations for Cohesion and CAP, which are priority areas for Ireland. To maintain CAP and Cohesion spending at the level proposed by the Commission, the Presidency has proposed adjustments to a range of other programmes. At the GAC, Member States expressed a range of views on the proposals according to their particular priorities, including in relation to the proposed overall amount, the distribution of funding across different areas and the possible sources of revenue for the MFF. Following discussion at the GAC, the Presidency presented the revised Negotiating Box to the December European Council. The Heads of State and Government called on the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, to take the negotiations forward with the aim of reaching a final agreement. Ireland continues to take a constructive approach in the MFF negotiations. We remain open to increasing our contribution to the budget from current levels provided European Added Value is ensured and our core interests are met, including maintaining funding for CAP.   </p></reply>

Importantly also, there was broad support for doing this by implementing the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework.</p><p>Necessary implementing legislation is being advanced in this jurisdiction.

These resources have come from both from my own Department and from several other Government Departments, and will ensure the Embassy's optimal engagement across all relevant policy areas. It is envisaged that the Embassy will continue to expand in order to support the bilateral relationship and to promote and protect Irish interests across all relevant sectors in a post-Brexit context. </p>  <p>  Beyond London, the continued development of our relationships with the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales will be ever more important as the UK moves forward with EU withdrawal. In Scotland, the Consulate in Edinburgh is active in promoting and protecting Irish interests, including taking a leading role on the current bilateral review of Ireland-Scotland relations. In addition, our footprint has also been re-established in Wales where the Consulate in Cardiff re-opened in April of this year, with a political and economic focus.</p>  <p>  The relationship between Ireland and the UK is, and will continue to be, a unique, vital and complex one. It is a relationship which requires great care, close attention and on-going engagement at every level right across the UK and its devolved administrations.</p></reply>

The meeting resulted in a commitment by all parties to deescalate the violence through ceasefires, further disengagement, and demining. If these commitments are fulfilled, the parties have committed to meeting again within four months to discuss political and security conditions necessary for the organisation of local elections in eastern Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  On 12 December Chancellor Merkel and President Macron briefed the European Council on progress at the Normandy summit, and EU leaders agreed to extend the economic sanctions imposed on Russia for another six months, until July 2020. The sanctions were introduced in 2014 and their duration is linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders. We welcome the efforts of France and Germany to find a resolution through the Normandy Format and stand ready to support the EU and the OSCE in the implementation of these agreements. Ireland particularly welcomes the humanitarian aspects of the agreements made and provisions for a de-escalation of violence. We strongly support the establishment of additional disengagement zones and the plans for an updated demining plan. The maintenance of the agreed upon ceasefire will have significant benefits in easing the dire humanitarian situation of civilians in the region.</p></reply>

I have continuously raised these issues in all my interactions with the US Administration and US political leaders. In April, I discussed these matters with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and her congressional delegation when they visited Ireland. The Taoiseach has also raised the issue of the undocumented Irish during his high level engagements with the US, including during the visit of President Trump this summer. The issue was also raised with Vice President Pence during his visit in September.</p>  <p>  The Government Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has also worked closely on this issue with my Department, engaging with key US stakeholders. He has met with senior officials in the US Administration and with representatives from the US Congress to discuss the undocumented Irish, most recently during a visit to Washington D.C. last week. He is supported in his work by the Americas Unit of my Department, and our Embassy in Washington, DC. Officials in the Americas Unit of my Department also regularly meet with the US Embassy in Dublin to discuss visa and immigration issues.</p>  <p>  In the US, Irish officials continue to engage and advocate on behalf of this vulnerable community. Officials in my Department, including our Embassy in Washington, D.C. and our seven Consulates General across the US, are monitoring the situation closely and are continuing to actively support Irish community groups that work with undocumented Irish citizens. My officials engage with US officials on immigration issues on an ongoing basis, including with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Our Mission network also works closely with the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres in the US.  The Coalition and its members provide reliable and accurate information to any Irish citizen in the US with concerns. The Coalition and its member organisations receive significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme for their work, including their support for vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. In 2018, over &euro;3 million was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including the Irish Centres. </p></reply>

A significant number of Rohingya civilians were also internally displaced within Rakhine State and 128,000 people remain in IDP camps having fled previous bouts of violence. Recent months have again witnessed an escalation of violence in Rakhine State and neighbouring Chin State due to ongoing conflict between the Myanmar Security Forces and ethnic armed groups. The situation remains unstable with increasing violence generating further displacement of civilians.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains deeply concerned over the findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission (IIFFM), and other special mandate holders regarding gross human rights violations committed by the Myanmar Military Forces (Tatmadaw), many of which amount to the gravest crimes under international law. </p>  <p>  These include a finding by the IIFFM that there is sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the Tatmadaw chain of command, so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine State. Ireland, together with our EU partners, has consistently called for the accountability of those who may be responsible for such crimes and has engaged in a number of actions at international level in this regard. </p>  <p>  The EU Foreign Affairs Council has adopted a series of Council Conclusions addressing gross human rights violations in Myanmar&rsquo;s Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States. These conclusions press for Myanmar to take meaningful action towards the creation of conditions conducive to a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of those displaced to their places of origin and to hold to account those responsible for criminal acts. </p>  <p>  The EU has also worked with our international partners to press for action at UN level including acting as pen-holder on several key initiatives including the establishment of both the UNHRC mandated Independent International Fact-Finding Mission and the recently operational Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. These are important steps in ensuring accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims.      </p>  <p>  On 11 November 2019, The Gambia submitted an application to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging breaches of the Genocide Convention by Myanmar. Officials in my Department, including in the Irish Embassy in The Hague, are monitoring this case closely.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work with our EU and other international partners to press for a long-term sustainable resolution to the Rohingya crisis that will provide a pathway for refugees to safely return and to urge Myanmar to hold to account those responsible for serious criminal acts.</p></reply>

During a visit to Manchester in June for the British Irish Council, the Taoiseach reiterated this commitment. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the new consulate will cover the entire North of England, including major population centres such as Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield. This would broadly match the area known as the 'Northern Powerhouse', an area with a population of c. 15 million people.   </p>  <p>  A decision on the timeline for opening the new consulate, as well as the optimum location, will be taken in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, it is worth noting that the Government has committed increased resources to our Embassy in London in the last few years, which was already the largest bilateral Embassy in our network. These resources have come from both from my own Department and from several other Government Departments and will ensure the Embassy's optimal engagement across all relevant policy areas. It is envisaged that the Embassy will continue to expand in order to support the bilateral relationship and to promote and protect Irish interests across all relevant sectors in a post-Brexit context. </p>  <p>  Ireland also engages closely with the devolved administrations. In Scotland, the Consulate in Edinburgh is active in promoting and protecting Irish interests, including taking a leading role on the current bilateral review of Ireland-Scotland relations. In addition, our footprint has also been re-established in Wales where the Consulate in Cardiff re-opened in April of this year, with a political and economic focus. </p></reply>

These events brought together over a dozen Agencies and their parent Departments &ndash; the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - under one roof and were attended by approximately 2,500 people over the October-November period.</p><p>In the lead up to the March and April Brexit deadlines this year, my Department working closely with the Department of the Taoiseach and other Government Departments initiated a Brexit preparedness public information campaign. This campaign ran to ensure that key audiences were aware of the potential impact of a No Deal Brexit and the mitigation measures that they could take, with the support of Government where appropriate and with particular reference to the gov.ie/Brexit website. This national and local campaign activity was across TV, radio, print, internet and social media. </p><p>Building on the &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; roadshows and the broad ranging information campaign in advance of the March and April Brexit deadlines, I along with Minister Heather Humphreys and Minister Helen McEntee launched a &lsquo;Getting Your Business Brexit Ready &ndash; Practical Steps&rsquo; campaign in September.  This campaign informed businesses and consumers on the practical steps that all businesses should take to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. Central to this campaign is a user-friendly digital booklet, which provides a comprehensive overview for businesses on the core steps they should take, and it can be accessed at <i>gov.ie/Brexit</i>.</p><p>In addition to this booklet, a two week national and local radio campaign urged businesses to take action and review readiness under 9 key areas. This campaign targeted businesses and other affected sectors and encouraged them to take the necessary steps to mitigate the risk in advance of the Brexit deadline of 31 October 2019. This ad campaign was followed by a further citizen awareness public information campaign, which ran on national and local radio in the first two weeks of October.</p><p>In 2018 the initial Brexit related advertising expenditure was &euro; 298,593.73.  In 2019 the total expenditure on advertising was &euro; 1,028,254.31.</p></reply>

There are countries which have been required to take in large numbers of asylum seekers and others who continue to resist taking in any. Ms. Ylva Johansson, the recently appointed EU Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, has been tasked with developing a &ldquo;New Pact on Migration and Asylum&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  We have consistently called for all EU member states to play their part in burden-sharing and helping to relieve pressure on frontline Member States. The issue of migration will not go away. Over 1200 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year. The EU must intensify its efforts to advance work in this area, particularly in relation to reform of the Common European Asylum System.  Any solution should be based on responsibility and solidarity. I look forward to the von der Leyen Commission and the new Commissioner, Ms Johansson, coming forward with proposals early in 2020.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, Ireland has admitted over 2,900 people through the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR-led Refugee Resettlement Programme. Furthermore, we have allocated 100 spaces in 2019 to take people who were rescued in the Mediterranean and to process their applications for international protection. In addition, Ireland has been active in Search and Rescue missions in the Mediterranean since 2015. The Irish Naval Service has rescued more than 17,500 people since the beginning of the crisis.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supports measures to address the root causes of irregular migration, through humanitarian and developmental programmes in developing countries. Indeed, Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of &euro;15 million for the EU&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Africa is the third highest per capita contribution by an EU Member State. </p>  <p>  Globally, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is one of Ireland&rsquo;s key UN partner agencies for development assistance and is the main agency providing protection and humanitarian assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). In 2019, Ireland provided a total of &euro;15.5 Million (US$17m) to UNHCR&rsquo;s global operations. This included &euro;9 million un-earmarked core funding and &euro;6.5 million via country programmes.  </p>  <p>  While the social, economic and political stresses arising from the migration crisis are very considerable, it is essential that humanitarian and legal obligations continue to be met. This includes the reception conditions for applicants for international protection.  Applicants who are in detention should be treated with full respect for human dignity and in accordance with relevant EU and international standards. This is an issue to which our Missions, working closely with local EU Delegations and Embassies of EU Partners, are and will continue to pay close attention to both in frontline and transit states currently receiving high levels of persons arriving from outside Europe seeking international protection.</p></reply>

We consistently and proactively engage with these mechanisms, including through the Universal Periodic Review. We are also active in other multilateral fora focused on human rights, including the Council of Europe and the OSCE, to highlight situations of concern and to call for action. </p>  <p>  We also greatly value the role of civil society in the promotion of human rights and regularly consult with civil society organisations and human rights experts, notably through the DFAT Human Rights Committee. Many of our Embassies also integrate human rights issues into their ongoing bilateral dialogue with partner Governments, as well as providing support as appropriate to local civil society organisations and human rights defenders on the ground.</p></reply>

In 2018, &euro;449.43 million was allocated through bilateral channels, including over &euro;169 million channelled through NGOs.  A further &euro;342.2 million was disbursed through the EU and the wider multilateral system, where core missions and objectives closely aligned with Ireland&rsquo;s policy priorities.  Over 130 countries received assistance from Ireland in 2018, either bilaterally or through at least one of Ireland's multilateral or other partnerships.</p>  <p>  Our bilateral partnerships and our work through the EU, United Nations and other multilateral organisations, have enabled Ireland to direct vital assistance to people living in challenging and insecure environments.  The Overseas Development Institute, an internationally recognised policy think-tank, has ranked Ireland as the world's leading donor in targeting extreme poverty. </p>  <p>  For 2020, the Government has allocated almost &euro;838 million for ODA.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, they reported that of the approximately US$106 billion in total bilateral commitments, US$13.2 billion was tied with a further US$2.6 billion partially untied, giving an overall total of partially untied and tied aid of almost 15%. </p>  <p>  Evidence has shown that such "tied" aid increases the costs of a development intervention/project by as much as 15 to 30 percent. Untying aid, on the other hand, avoids unnecessary costs and gives the recipient the freedom to procure goods and services from virtually any country.     </p>  <p>  The OECD in an effort to reduce the volume of tied aid has recommended to its member countries that all aid provided to least developed countries, heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs), Other Low-Income Countries (OLICs) and countries which are only eligible to financing from International Development Association (IDA) should be untied. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains one of the few countries which has consistently provided untied aid. Ireland's new policy for international development A Better World, launched earlier this year, commits the government to maintaining an untied, quality, focused and coherent development programme. During the consultation process there was strong public support for continuing this commitment to untied aid.</p></reply>

There have been reports of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law. The EU has called on all parties to immediately implement a ceasefire and to engage with the UN to ensure a political solution to the conflict. </p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 9 December, Ministers discussed the upcoming international summit in Berlin, which is part of UN Special Representative Ghassan Salam&eacute;&rsquo;s roadmap for peace in Libya. I believe that Germany is playing a valuable role on this issue, and hope that this summit will pave the way towards a comprehensive and lasting cessation of hostilities. </p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned about the effect of the instability in Libya on migrants and refugees in Libya. Human rights abuses against migrants and refugees in Libya, including in detention centres, are a matter of grave concern. During a national statement during the UN Human Rights Council in September 2019, Ireland noted that the system of detaining migrants and refugees in Libya, often in appalling conditions, is reprehensible. I applaud efforts by humanitarian organisations to relocate migrants and refugees for their safety, to the extent possible, in this very difficult situation.</p>  <p>  The EU, through cooperation with the UN and the African Union, has helped over 48,000 people stranded in Libya to return voluntarily to their countries of origin, and has evacuated over 4,000 people in need of international protection. The EU has also mobilised &euro;46 million in humanitarian support for people in need in Libya since 2014. Almost &euro;328 million has been mobilised under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa for protecting migrants, refugees and internally displaced people in Libya, and supporting local communities to cope with the migration challenge.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans, and migrants and refugees in Libya, will require the restoration of political stability. Ireland and the EU will continue to support efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict and build a better future for the Libyan people.</p></reply>

The UN estimate that almost 168 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  Given the scale of need, donors have increased their level of humanitarian assistance in recent years. Total global humanitarian funding grew from an estimated $22.2 billion in 2014 to an estimated $28.9 billion in 2018. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also increased its level of assistance in response to growing needs. Over the three years 2016-2018 Ireland contributed a total of over &euro;559 million in humanitarian response. </p>  <p>  As well as the scale of funding, the efficiency and effectiveness of international humanitarian response is also vital. Ireland is a strong champion of the multilateral system, and has worked closely with the UN Office of the Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in improving the coordination of the international humanitarian response.  In the period 2018-2019, Ireland was Chair of the OCHA's  Donor Support Group. In this role, Ireland led discussions with the UN and key donors on improving the effectiveness of the international response to major crises. Ireland also worked closely with OCHA during its own process of reform and reorganisation, helping to improve its ability to effectively coordinate humanitarian responses. </p>  <p>  Since June 2019 Ireland has been co-Chair of the ICRC's Donor Support Group.  In this role Ireland will lead discussions with the ICRC and other major donors on improving humanitarian response, notably with regard to protracted humanitarian crises, and ensuring a gender sensitive approach to humanitarian emergencies.</p></reply>

Since 2002, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has issued an annual report on children and armed conflict, listing violations committed against children during armed conflict. The most recent report, published in July 2019, found that 2018 was the worst year on record for children caught up in armed conflict. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and use of children as soldiers is explicitly prohibited under international humanitarian law and human rights law. In 1999, the UN Security Council passed its first Resolution, UNSCR 1261, on the impact of armed conflict on children and condemned violations in that context. In the same year, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child entered into force. Article 22 of the Charter sets out a prohibition on the recruitment and direct participation in hostilities of any person under the age of 18 years.</p>  <p>  Ever since, the Security Council has established important tools to strengthen child protection and to strengthen implementation of international standards, including the position of UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict who investigates and develops best practices to address the recruitment and use of child soldiers. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to the eradication of the recruitment and use of child soldiers. In addition to the focus in our development programmes on addressing the socio-economic causes of conflict, Ireland supports more targeted interventions by working with organisations such as UNICEF, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the International Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland co-sponsored UN Resolution 2427, which states that children recruited by armed groups should be treated primarily as victims of violations of international law. In 2019, Ireland co-sponsored UN Resolution 2475, which contains important language on the specific needs of children with disabilities affected by armed conflict. </p>  <p>  This year, Ireland also joined the Group of Friends of the Reintegration of Child Soldiers and is supportive of reintegration programmes which are fundamental to realising the Rights of the Child, ending the cycle of violence, and ensuring sustainable peace. Ireland is also a signatory to the Safe Schools Declaration, which is an inter-governmental political commitment to protect students, teachers, schools and universities from armed conflict.</p>  <p>   Ireland is committed to working with our international partners to protect all children from aggression and violence.</p></reply>

The macroeconomic outlook is set out in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook published with Budget 2020. This included, at Box 4, an assessment of the macroeconomic outlook that would apply in the event of an agreed exit by the UK at end October.  </p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement endorsed by the European Council, will now require ratification by the European Parliament and the UK Parliament. Pending ratification of the deal, it is not possible to say if the outlook will be different to that set out in Budget 2020.  </p>  <p>  If the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified, the UK will enter a transition period until at least the end of 2020. In this situation the outlook would be broadly similar to that set out in Table 4 (Box 4) in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2020. This shows that, in the event of an agreed exit, GDP growth is forecast to be 3.1 per cent in 2020, with employment growth projected at 1.7 per cent next year and the unemployment rate expected to be 5.1 per cent.  </p>  <p>  The revised Political Declaration envisages an ambitious trading relationship for goods on the basis of a Free Trade Agreement, but until there is greater clarity on the post-transition relationship there is likely to be continued uncertainty, particularly with respect to private sector investment. My Department has been in contact with the ESRI on the economic impact of the revised Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future relationship. I am satisfied that the existing analysis in the joint research by the Department of Finance and ESRI, published in March this year, broadly captures the range of possible future relationships. The analysis included a free trade agreement (of which there could be many forms), and a trading relationship under World Trade Organisation (WTO) frameworks. The impacts of these were modelled and estimated in the joint research which was published in March this year.  </p>  <p>  Under these scenarios, over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) the level of GDP would be of the order of between 1.9 and 3.3 per cent lower, respectively, compared to a situation where the UK remains in the EU. The negative impacts will be most severely felt in those sectors with strong export ties to the UK market &ndash; such as the agri-food, manufacturing and tourism sectors and also SMEs generally &ndash; along with their suppliers. The impact will be particularly noticeable outside the main cities. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments with respect to the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the future relationship with the UK, and will update the macroeconomic and fiscal projections to take account of any developments in the Spring of next year at the latest.</p></reply>

Extensive restrictions are in place and these are not simply confined to a small number of senior bankers whose pay is restricted by the &euro;500,000 pay cap (excluding a standard pension contribution). These affect c.23,000 workers across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding. The policy dictates that variable pay including bonuses and any other fringe benefits including the likes of health insurance and childcare cannot be paid to any staff members from the most junior lowest paid staff to the most senior ranks.</p>  <p>  As a result I undertook to carry out a review of Government bank remuneration policy to determine if it remains fit for purpose. My department worked with the specialist advisory division of Korn Ferry to undertake this review. Stakeholders engaged with included the major institutional investors in the banks, proxy advisory firms, the Financial Services Union (FSU), the chairs of the remuneration committee in each of the banks, the Central Bank of Ireland and representatives of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in Frankfurt.</p>  <p>  I have received and read the report.

Acts, it actively pursues claims harvesting websites.  From its various consultations, the Department has been advised that the number of active &lsquo;claims harvesting&rsquo; websites operating in Ireland has drastically reduced in recent years from approximately 60 in 2016 to around 11 more recently, although this figure can fluctuate.  The Law Society states that unfortunately, the process of identifying the owners of the websites is often frustrated by the sophisticated ways in which the website owners conceal their identity.  For example, it would appear that many of the websites, which are operating in Ireland, may not actually be located within the jurisdiction nor within other EU countries.  I understand that this factor increases the levels of complexity of investigations, as it can be particularly difficult to establish who the owners of the relevant websites are.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, my Department has been informed by the Law Society that 29 websites have been removed from the internet since 2014, with six of these websites removed since June 2019.  Another two websites have been identified as belonging to a company that has gone into liquidation.</p>  <p>  With the application of section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, solicitor advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present.  Instead, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will maintain the restrictions of any advertisement which, in the opinion of the Authority, &ldquo;expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages or offers any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for personal injuries or seek legal services in connection with such claims.&rdquo;  The Authority will be undertaking consultations for the making of regulations for the advertising of legal services by legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, under section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  It is my understanding that the new advertising regulations are planned to come into operation in Quarter 1 of 2020.</p>  <p>  In light of the above, it is clear that the regulation of claims harvesting websites is a complex matter but that the existing solicitor regulations have helped prevent such websites to evolve to become a more prevalent feature of the Irish personal injuries environment, in the way that they are in the UK, for example.  I am satisfied that the relevant professional bodies are pursuing such websites to the extent that they can in light of the challenges that exist.  Notwithstanding this, my officials will continue to monitor the prevalence or otherwise of this issue.  In addition, I would suggest that if anyone is of the view that particular solicitor firms are using such claim harvesting websites, they should report the matter to the Law Society/Legal Services Regulatory Authority for investigation.</p></reply>

This change was introduced by the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 and became operational on 1 December 2018. What it means in practical terms is that compensation levels payable from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) for third party motor insurance claims as a result of a motor insurer insolvency are aligned with the compensation levels paid out by the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) where a motorist is in a collision with an unidentified or uninsured driver. </p>  <p>  The 2018 Act requires motor insurers to contribute an amount equivalent to 2% of gross motor insurance premiums annually to the MIICF until it reaches &euro;150m, and thereafter a rate of 1% until it meets its target level of up to &euro;200 million, when contributions cease. MIBI is required to invest these monies prudently to ensure that they are available to recoup the ICF for 35% of any future third party motor insurance claim which it is required to pay. </p>  <p>  Department of Finance officials have been engaging closely with MIBI in relation to its new role. On the 30th July MIBI submitted to the Minister the &lsquo;Motor Insurers Insolvency Compensation Fund Annual Report for the year ended 31st December 2018&rsquo;. This has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. At end-December 2018, following one month of contributions made to it by motor insurers, the total contributions made by members equalled &euro;2,498,972. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to say exactly when contributions will cease as that will depend on amongst other things the volume of gross motor insurance premiums written in a year and whether there are any calls upon the fund. However, if we were to base our projections on the amount of just under &euro;2.5 m collected for December 2018, this would result in an annual collection of &euro;30m a year, which means after 5 years, the deduction rate would fall to 1%. Therefore another 3 to 4 years of collection at this lower level would be required before the &euro;200m threshold was crossed. This would suggest a period of 8 to 9 years before contributions cease in a steady state scenario, and assuming no call upon the fund during this period. </p></reply>

No. 174 of 2019), earlier this year, the NCID has been established in the Central Bank of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on Monday, 16 December 2019, the Central Bank of Ireland published the first National Claims Information Database Report on Private Motor Insurance, which includes aggregate data from the insurance industry.  The aggregate nature of the data collected has meant that there are fewer legal and technical complexities involved, and that is why it has been possible to have the NCID established and reporting so quickly.  </p>  <p>  Both Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy and I commend the work of the Central Bank in bringing this Report to fruition.  We believe it is an excellent report, which provides an objective overview of private motor claims costs including legal costs over the last number of years. </p>  <p>  I would hope that going forward the increased transparency brought about by the NCID, along with other legislative changes, can help to provide more stability in the market, thus avoiding the peaks and troughs for consumers in terms of premium pricing.  This should ultimately make the Irish market more attractive to new entrants and I would hope that this might be one of the outcomes of this exercise in time.</p>  <p>  I believe that the Report shows that the insurance and legal sectors have both serious questions to answer regarding the difficulties we have faced over the last number of years with the price of motor insurance.</p>  <p>  It appears that insurers under-priced in the early part of this decade and then increased premiums beyond levels that were needed to cover losses incurred and consequently are now making significant profits.  At the same time, the legal costs associated with the litigation settlement channel seem disproportionate when one considers that the report indicates that the award levels for those settlements under &euro;100,000 are not much higher than equivalent settlements in PIAB.  In addition, the length of time to settle these claims is nearly two years longer than in PIAB, which in itself drives up the cost of insurance.  </p>  <p>  While it is true to say that the nature or severity of the injury claims settled in the different channels can vary significantly and there may be good reasons for pursuing litigation, I believe that this report makes it clear that in overall terms, PIAB offers the most cost effective settlement channel and I would hope that its settlement rates increase going forward.  This is a key aim of the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  </p>  <p>  The NCID Report also demonstrates why we must address award levels in this country if we want to see cheaper insurance premiums and an increased risk appetite from insurers.  In this regard, the NCID Report shows that personal injury claims have been driving the cost of claims in recent years &ndash; representing 75% of the ultimate claims costs over the period.  This is not sustainable in my view.  This is all the more concerning as the Report shows that these increased costs are not being driven by a higher frequency of claims.  I believe that our focus therefore must continue to be on the Judicial Council and its publication of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines.</p></reply>

The National Lottery Act 2013 (&quot;the Act&quot;) created the Office of the National Lottery Regulator to regulate the operation of the National Lottery through the following functions:</p><p>1. To procure the holding of the National Lottery.</p><p>2. To monitor and enforce compliance by the Operator with the act and terms and conditions of the Licence. </p><p>3. To consider for approval certain matters relating to the National Lottery (including schemes for National Lottery games.)</p><p>4. To exercise the enforcement rights of any trademark of the National Lottery</p><p>5. To manage and control the National Lottery Fund. </p><p>The Operator of the National Lottery, Premier Lotteries Ireland (PLI) is responsible for ensuring that it operates the National Lottery in compliance with the Act and the terms of the Licence. The Regulator must exercise these functions with the objectives of ensuring the probity and long-term sustainability of the National Lottery, that the interests of participants are protected, and, subject to those objectives being met, maximise returns for good causes. </p><p>The 118 page Licence to operate the National Lottery covers a very wide range of aspects which relate to the operation and regulation of the National Lottery including: payments to the National Lottery Fund, testing of draw equipment, use of trademarks, and the Operator's obligations at the end of the Licence period. There are also four Codes of Practice in place, including a Sales Code of Practice, a Participants' Code of Practice, an Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice and a Vetting Procedures Code of Practice. </p><p>The Regulator is empowered under the Act to obtain any information she requires from the Operator, and to appoint investigators where appropriate. The Licence provides that the Regulator may withhold an amount from the payments due to the Operator if the Operator has failed, or fails, to comply with any provision of the Licence. </p><p>With regard to the operation of games, section 45 of the Act requires that, prior to its launch, the Operator must submit a scheme setting out the rules of the game to the Regulator for consideration and approval. The Regulator determines whether the scheme for a new game is compliant with the Act and the Licence. Where a game is approved, the Operator is responsible for ensuring that it operates the game in compliance with the approved scheme. If the Operator wishes to amend the scheme of an approved game, it must submit such amendments to the Regulator for approval prior to implementing any changes.</p><p>The Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery monitors compliance by reviewing and querying various reports and activities, spot checks of compliance, and proactive themed reviews. Full details of these activities are available in the Regulator&rsquo;s annual reports on the Regulator&rsquo;s website. Breaches may be detected through one of these activities or through disclosure by the operator.</p><p>Any breaches of the Licence or the Act are reported to the Minister, and subsequently the Oireachtas, in the Regulator&rsquo;s Annual Report to the Minister in relation to the performance of his or her functions in the previous financial year pursuant to Section 22(3) of the Act. </p><p>This significant level of oversight reflects the importance of the National Lottery to the State. Since the establishment of the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery, four breaches of the Licence have been reported to the Minister and no breaches of the Act have been found. Three breaches were detected by the Office of the Regulator and one was disclosed by the Operator.</p><p>In 2016, an analysis by the Regulator of online play data led to a formal investigation. Following this investigation, in 2017 the Operator was found to have breached the terms of the Licence regarding players who have elected to self-exclude themselves from online play. </p><p>Separately, regular monitoring of the Operator&rsquo;s marketing communications in 2017 also led to a finding of a breach regarding the Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice. On foot of these findings, the Regulator issued directions to the Operator, and the Operator improved its controls on self-excluded accounts and withdrew the non-compliant advertisement.</p><p>During 2018, the Regulator determined that there were two instances where the Operator breached the Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice. One was a marketing email issued in error to non-subscribers; the other was a media release that breached the standards. The Operator improved its controls on issuing marketing emails and, in response to an instruction from the Regulator, withdrew the non-compliant media release.</p><p>Full details of these breaches are available in the Regulator&rsquo;s annual reports for 2017 and 2018 on the Regulator&rsquo;s website and these are outlined in a document attached to this response for ease of reference.</p><p>">Additional Information</p></reply>

The draft review received considerable attention from the public, media and elected representatives and the Commissioners of Public Works are appreciative of all those who engaged with the documentation and provided their valuable opinions and insights for consideration. </p>  <p>  A high proportion of respondents held the view that the Park ought to be left untouched and that the essential character of the Park ought to be preserved. Such an opinion is consistent with the Phoenix Park Conservation Management Plan 2011 which sets out the guiding principles for the long term conservation vision for the Park and any proposed future conservation projects or enhancements to facilities will only be advanced with reference to these. This is to ensure that the essential historic character of the Park is maintained for the future. Additionally, only such proposals that are consistent with existing management practices and seek to support existing policy in relation to the management and operations of the Park will be considered.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Commissioners have listened carefully to what the public, local communities and other stakeholders have had to say. Their submissions will influence and inform how best the existing facilities might be enhanced or improved in the Park in the future. </p>  <p>  The Commissioners essentially seek to enhance the Phoenix Park&rsquo;s potential as one of the great parks of the world by undertaking appropriate conservation works and upgrades to facilities, such as toilets for example, to support the Park&rsquo;s attractiveness. Such enhancements will be to the benefit of all users, local, national and international, and will necessarily be subject to statutory planning permission and availability of adequate funding.</p></reply>

However, it is open to local authorities to apply for funding under the Minor Works Scheme which was introduced by my Office on an administrative, non-statutory basis in 2009.</p><p>The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised fluvial flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. The works to be funded are carried out under local authority powers and ongoing maintenance of the completed works is the responsibility of the Council. </p><p>Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management. Full details of this scheme are available on www.opw.ie</p><p>Funding of &euro;500,000 has recently been approved under this scheme for Monaghan County Council to progress important flood alleviation works in Monaghan Town. The works will consist of the construction of a new culvert across the N54 and the R162 in Monaghan Town and additional flood alleviation measures for the Castle Road area which provides access to the town centre public car parks and shopping area.</p><p>The OPW also has statutory responsibility for and carries out a programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance. These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945, with the primary purpose of improving the drainage of agricultural lands.</p><p>The OPW&rsquo;s annual Arterial Drainage Maintenance Works Programme includes the following river catchments in the Cavan and Monaghan areas: Boyne, Inny, Blackwater and Glyde &amp;amp; Dee.</p><p>The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State, culminated with the launch on 3<sup>rd</sup>May, 2018 of 29 flood risk management plans which propose 118 new outline flood relief projects on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW).  All of these projects are to be funded under the Government's 10 year flood risk investment programme of almost &euro;1 billion under the <i>National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027</i>.  </p><p>As it is not possible to progress all 118 proposed new schemes at once, funding of &euro;257 million for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country was also announced which would be progressed to detailed design and construction, including the five largest schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small or minor projects under &euro;1 million which will be progressed directly by local authorities.Aside from the 5 largest schemes and the 31 small or minor projects, the remaining projects in the initial phase of implementation were selected on the basis of those projects which would provide the greatest benefit in terms of the greatest number of properties protected on a regionally.</p><p>A flood relief scheme for Cavan Town has been included in this initial phase of implementation, and Cavan County Council confirmed in May 2019 that the council would act as lead agency on the management and delivery of the proposed flood relief scheme in Cavan Town, valued at &euro;4.44m. A project steering group has been set up comprising of members from Cavan County Council and from OPW administrative engineering and regional divisions. The OPW has also approved funding for Cavan County Council to recruit additional staff to work exclusively on progressing the flood relief scheme in County Cavan and will form part of the steering group once appointed.</p><p>OPW has set up frameworks of consultants, which Cavan County Council can also use to progress the design of the project, which will help to speed up the process to construction.  Once consultants are appointed to progress the scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies as well as the public will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the scheme. </p><p>The next task for the steering group is to initiate the procurement of engineering design consultants and environmental consultants from the framework for such consultants, established by the OPW. It is expected that consultants will be appointed by the end Q1 2020.</p><p>While the three proposed schemes in County Monaghan, for Ballybay, Iniskeen and Monaghan town, are not in the first tranche of projects to be progressed, the OPW and Monaghan County Council will work closely to ensure that they will be commenced as soon as possible within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.</p></reply>

The confidentiality provisions of the 2002 Act require that the records relating to the personal testimony of individuals be disposed of following the dissolution of the Redress Board and Review Committee.The Board received legal advice in 2009 that Section 28(7) of the Redress Act <i>'contemplates only such disposal as will render all such documents unusable and the information contained in it inaccessible to anyone and that in practice the only issue for the Board and Committee is the mechanism by which this can be achieved&rsquo;.  </i>In other words, disposal means the destruction of the records</p><p>It is worth looking at the operating procedures used by the investigation Committee of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (attached).As you can see, the complainant and allrespondents got copies of all documentation.  The Residential Institutions Redress Board have an existing protocol in place whereby people who appeared before the Board can access a copy of their file.</p><p>The provision in the Records Retention Bill that access to the records will only be possible under regulations on the expiry of the 75 year period was included, in part, to reflect concerns raised 4 years ago at the 2015 pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills, regarding matters such as</p><p>- the right to privacy of the individuals concerned</p><p>- the expectation of confidentiality under which persons engaged with the bodies.</p><p>There is a mis-apprehension about what information could be disclosed to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While people provided their personal testimonials on a confidential basis, that information could still be disclosed by the Commission to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if it was thought that such disclosure was necessary in order to prevent the continuance of an act or omission constituting a serious offence.</p><p>There may also be expectations that there is a wealth of material that the Commission holds that can be made available.  The documentation discovered during the course of the Commission&rsquo;s work exists in several categories:</p><p>(1) by named individual or organisation who provided services to the commission; </p><p>(2) by topic to which the discovered documents relate; </p><p>(3) by name of religious congregation. The discovered documents largely consist of copies of original documents submitted to the Commission. </p><p>There are issues surrounding the use of discovered documents for a purpose other than that for which they were discovered. There would, therefore, likely be issues surrounding the ultimate public release of discovered documents.</p><p>I would hold the view that historical abuse has not been hidden away but is thoroughly documented in the Ryan Report with chapters on the history of institutions, the administration and financing of those institutions, the role of the Department of Education and Skills, and the different congregations involved in the running of those institutions.  Volume III documents the demographic and social circumstances of witnesses before their admission to the institutions, their experiences and reports of abuse while in the institutions and their life following discharge from the institutions.  </p><p>Finally, there is no restriction on former residents describing the abuse they suffered when resident in an institution. Section 28(6) of the 2002 Act prohibits the publication of certain details of applications to or awards made by the Redress Board. This is a necessary requirement of the &ldquo;no-fault&rdquo; basis under which the scheme operated.Many survivors have documented their experiences in institutions through print or other media. </p><p>The Records Retention Bill was discussed at an Education Committee meeting in November and I understand that the next step is for the Committee to write to me concerning the Bill and the views expressed at that meeting. </p><p> </p></reply>

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>All schools are therefore resourced to provide additional teaching support for pupils who may require extra support and guidance has been provided to schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model. These guidelines are available at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p><p>In relation to the provision of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) Support, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for allocating a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  </p><p>The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in Department Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  </p><p>In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, the NCSE take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p><p>SNA allocations to all schools can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.</p><p>The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support because the requirements outlined in Circular 0030/2014 were not complied with.  Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA support to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the children concerned.</p><p>Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support for 2019/20, but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, it may continue to make applications to the NCSE.</p><p>As this question relates to the provision of SNA support to a particular child, I have referred the question to the NCSE for its direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p></reply>

Securing the future of small schools is a priority for me as Minister for Education and Skills.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has provided for improved teacher staffing levels for small schools. This measure will see a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher.</p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the appointment and retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and more favourable enrolment thresholds for one teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  Small schools have also benefitted from the 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule for all schools implemented in 2016 and again in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific appeal measure for small schools, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule at primary level currently operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level. Each 1 point adjustment to the pupil teacher ratio at primary level is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;14.4m per annum.  </p></reply>

Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.</p><p>As approximately 1% of the school population require the support of a special class, it is not possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in every school.</p><p>Instead the NCSE ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p><p>Before approaching a particular school to request the establishment of a special class, the NCSE take into account both present and future potential need within the area and must be satisfied that the class is sustainable and appropriately located.</p><p>The NCSE has planned further expansion of special class and school places to meet demand for the coming years, which will include additional post primary special class provision.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, there is a range of supports including capital funding available to the school.</p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me.

To date, the details of nine children have been provided to my Department.</p>  <p>  As a matter of priority, my Department in conjunction with the NCSE, completed its review of the special educational supports in place for each of the nine children and has now ensured that they are in receipt of appropriate special educational needs supports in line with the terms of various schemes. </p>  <p>  Supports available include Special Education Teaching support in schools; funding for Assistive Technology such as Soundfield and FM systems; and guidance from the NCSE&rsquo;s Visiting Teacher service on classroom adaptation and school staff training.</p>  <p>  All children are in receipt of special educational needs teaching support under the new model introduced in 2017 and revised in 2019. The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on that school&rsquo;s educational profile, to allow schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools. Schools deploy additional teaching resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs. </p>  <p>  The Visiting Teachers Service has assessed the educational needs of all nine children and made recommendations to their schools. In accordance with the Visiting Teachers&rsquo; Service Referral Process and Procedures, children with mild or unilateral hearing loss are placed on the &ldquo;On Request&rdquo; caseload and children with moderate-profound hearing loss are placed on the &ldquo;Active&rdquo; caseload of the Visiting Teacher.</p>  <p>  The Visiting Teachers have assessed the acoustic conditions in the schools and made recommendations to schools to put in place appropriate measures to cater for the children&rsquo;s needs. Schools may utilise existing funding streams from the Department such as the Minor Works Grant or Grants for furniture and equipment for special education needs, to provide equipment, if these are recommended. </p>  <p>  All nine children have received assistive technology, in accordance with the criteria of the scheme. </p>  <p>  With regard to teacher training, the NCSE can provide direct support to the schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible. Schools can apply for support through the NCSE&rsquo;s online application system, which is accessible via the NCSE website. </p>  <p>  The NCSE offers telephone advice, school visits from a member of the team, in-service courses for individual teachers, or whole-school training. Whole-school training will ensure that all teachers are equipped to cater for the children&rsquo;s educational needs, as they progress through school.</p>  <p>  Schools have been instructed to continue to engage with their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) and Visiting Teacher with regard to the special education needs of the children identified by the HSE review. Parents/guardians may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on the NCSE's website.</p>  <p>  My Department has made direct contact with both the schools and parents/guardians and a representative of my Department also met with a group of affected parents/guardians in November 2018 and March 2019. The HSE, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and NCSE were also represented at those meetings.</p>  <p>  Where applications for new or additional supports are made to either my Department or the NCSE in respect of the 9 children already identified, these will be considered as a matter of priority, in line with the terms of the various schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department will also continue to work with the HSE and where details of other affected children are supplied by the HSE, educational supports will urgently be reviewed, in conjunction with the NCSE.</p></reply>

The following table details the changes that have been made to the allowances between 1996 and 2006.  The 2013 Regulations made changes to certain aspects of the financial eligibility regime, however the allowances remain the same as provided for in the 2006 Regulations.  The Regulations have been amended on two further occasions; to provide that persons granted legal aid pursuant to the Abhaile Scheme do not need to be means tested and that persons granted legal aid in domestic violence cases do not have to pay a contribution.</p><p>There is no formal process for reviewing the Regulations.

The Board delivers these services through directly employed solicitors in its network of law centres around the country and private solicitors from its private practitioner panels.  </p><p>There is no requirement for an applicant to cite individual sections of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 when making an application for legal services.

When the Board grants legal aid it satisfies itself that the application meets all of the relevant criteria under the Act and Regulations. However it does not record a list of applicable criteria relating to each individual successful application. For this reason, the Legal Aid Board is not in a position to provide the specific information the Deputy seeks. </p><p>However, the Board informs me that, in practice, the number of applications made on a yearly basis involving facts in which the section referred to is invoked is small compared to the total number of applications.</p><p>By way of background</p><p>Section 28(9)(a)(ii) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 provides as follows: </p> <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(9) ( a ) Subject to any order made under subsection (10) and to the other provisions of this subsection, legal aid shall not be granted by the Board in respect of any of the following matters (referred to in this Act as &quot;designated matters&quot;)&hellip;. disputes concerning rights and interests in or over land; </blockquote>  <p>Effectively section 28(9)(a) provides for a list of matters (referred to as designated matters) that are not within the scope of civil legal aid and it is ultra vires the Act for the Board to grant legal aid in any such matter. However, section 28(9)(c) provides for a list of exemptions to the designated matters set out earlier in the Act. Section 28(9)(c)(iii) provides that:</p> <blockquote> 	&ldquo;Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) and subject to the other provisions of this Act, legal aid may be granted&hellip; where a subject matter of the dispute is the applicant's home (or what would be the applicant's home but for the dispute) and the Board considers that the applicant  	(I) suffers from an infirmity of mind or body due to old age or to other circumstances, or<br /><br />(II) may have been subjected to duress, undue influence or fraud in the matter, and that a refusal to grant legal aid would cause hardship to the applicant;&rdquo;  </blockquote>  <p>A number of criteria must be met for a matter to fall into this exception . Firstly, the subject matter of the dispute must be the applicant&rsquo;s home or what would be the applicant&rsquo;s home but for the dispute. Secondly, the Board must consider that the applicant either suffers from an infirmity of body or mind due to old age or to other circumstances, or that the applicant may have been subjected to duress, undue influence, or fraud in the matter.

With the arrival of a further 55 persons by the end of this month, a balance of only 72 persons will remain to be resettled under this strand.</p>  <p>  On the advice of the Defence Forces, it has not been possible for staff from my Department to travel to Beirut to complete the selection of this cohort, which will now take place in early 2020. Flexibility has been sought from the European Commission on the timing of these arrivals given the current volatility in Lebanon. </p>  <p>  The IRPP programme also includes the IRPP Humanitarian Admission Programme (IHAP) under which Irish citizens, programme refugees, UN Convention refugees and persons with subsidiary protection can apply for family members to come to Ireland where those persons are living in the top 10 refugee generating countries.  It is expected that 740 people will arrive under the Programme and 159 people have already arrived in the State. There will be some delay in the completion of the IHAP strand, as those granted permission to travel to Ireland make their own arrangements for travel, the exact timing of which is not known to the Department. </p>  <p>  In addition Ireland agreed to accept 77 unaccompanied minors from camps in Calais and Greece and 163 people who have been landed from the Mediterranean Search and Rescue operations.  Of these cohorts, 36 unaccompanied minors remain to be transferred to Ireland from Greece and 92 people are yet to arrive from the Search and Rescue missions.  There are a further 13 places not yet allocated to any of the mechanisms mentioned above which will complete Ireland's commitment under the IRPP.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Government agreed yesterday to Ireland pledging to welcome up to 2,900 refugees between 2020 and 2023 through a combination of resettlement and community sponsorship under plans put forward by Minister Flanagan and myself.  I was therefore able to make that pledge when I spoke at the first Global Refugee Forum, organised by the UNHCR to mark the first anniversary of the signing of the Global Compact on Refugees.  </p>  <p>  Under the plans, a new phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) will see 650 UNHCR resettlements in 2020, 700 in 2021, 750 in 2022 and 800 in 2023. The arrivals for the first two years will largely comprise Syrian refugees resident in Jordan and Lebanon, along with a pilot group of 150 Eritrean refugees resident in Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have obtained funding of &euro;9m from the European Commission to support the resettlement of 900 people between early 2020 and June 2021. </p>  <p>  I and Minister Flanagan are proud that Ireland, as an active member of the international community, will continue to play our part in providing a safe haven for those seeking refuge from war and persecution.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-18a.477.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800083#WRJ04600"><p>The issue of claims harvesting, whereby people involved in accidents are pursued by on-line and other entities for commercial gain and encouraged or induced to lodge insurance injury claims, is one which is increasingly complex to govern. Spurred on by advances in business technology and electronic media, those who operate harvesting entities in contravention of the law come from a variety of countries, backgrounds and disciplines that are proving prohibitive in terms of cost and scope to corral under a single regulator. </p>  <p>  Even in internet governance terms, these operators can literally change identity overnight when challenged, as they continue to be in this and other jurisdictions, and can operate outside the scope of national or EU law while also seeking to exploit several markets at once. These are the very substantial challenges that remain to finding a cost-effective regulatory response at either national or international level to claims harvesting operations, including as considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.</p>  <p>  As far as those aspects of claims harvesting which fall within the remit of my own Department may be concerned, the key regulatory focus continues to be on the interface between claims harvesters and those solicitors with whom they would wish to engage in a mercenary manner to the detriment of our insurance regime. This is being applied diligently by the Law Society which continues to take a strict approach against any offending solicitors or claims harvesters in this area as appropriate to the Society's role as the regulator of solicitors under the Solicitors' Acts. </p>  <p>  This approach, which has proven highly effective, has a number of key legislative components. Section 5 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002 generally prohibits unqualified persons from advertising a service of a legal nature that could otherwise be provided by a solicitor for a fee or reward.  This includes such advertising in relation to personal injuries claims in the context of claims harvesting websites. Moreover, section 62 of the Solicitors Act 1954 prohibits solicitors from rewarding or agreeing to reward unqualified persons for the introduction of legal business and provides that any such agreement is void. Under the Solicitors Advertising Regulations as recently updated by the Law Society with my consent under S.I. No. 229 of 2019, it remains the case that an advertisement intended to publicise or otherwise promote a solicitor in relation to the solicitor's practice shall be in such a form as shall not expressly or impliedly solicit, encourage or offer any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for damages for personal injuries or to contact the solicitor concerned with a view to such claims being made. </p>  <p>  From the active engagement by the Law Society and the on-going work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, I understand that the number of active claims harvesting websites operating in Ireland has drastically reduced in recent years from approximately 60 in 2016 to around 11 in more recent times. It is also understood from the Law Society that 29 websites have been removed from the internet on foot of its efforts since 2014, with six of these websites removed since June 2019.  The Society has previously issued relevant practice directions and directly notified claims referral companies found to be targeting solicitors about the statutory prohibition on solicitors paying referral fees. It has also successfully pursued these matters before the High Court and is, therefore, to be commended for the diligent and effective discharge of its particular regulatory functions in response to this threat to our insurance regime.</p>  <p>  This strict approach is set to continue under the new advertising provisions of section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. Under that section, such advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present but by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. Specifically, section 218(5)(d)(vi) of the 2015 Act allows for the restriction of any advertisement which, in the opinion of the Authority, &ldquo;expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages or offers any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for personal injuries or seek legal services in connection with such claims.&rdquo; The Authority will be carrying out the required public consultations in preparation for the new legal services advertising regulations coming into operation in Q1 of 2020. </p>  <p>  In so far, therefore, as claims harvesting operations are seeking to directly or indirectly engage solicitors in their claims work, the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2015 are operating as a bulwark against them with recognised effect. Such a regulatory approach will continue under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.

Where people who have had an application for residence refused or who simply overstay their permission to reside in this country and do not apply for an extension to their permission, the State must be allowed to exercise its legal right to remove them from the State.   </p>  <p>  It would be unwise to permit people to simply ignore our immigration laws and allow them and their families to remain here merely on the basis of the length of time that they have resided here without permission.   </p>  <p>  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their family's status.</p></reply>

The capital budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also been significantly increased - a total of &euro;92 million was provided this year, representing a 50% increase on capital investment in 2018. And capital investment will increase further to &euro;116.5 million in 2020. </p><p>The capital investment being made in Garda ICT infrastructure is particularly significant and amounts to &euro;342 million between 2016 and 2021. It is important to note that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The allocation and efficient use of Garda resources is also a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational demands.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that ICT is an essential tool for supporting the day-to-day operations of the entire Garda workforce, currently including over 14,300 Garda members, over 2,900 Garda staff as well as Garda Reserves.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that Garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24/7 basis. The key importance of technology was also clearly identified in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p><p>In line with the implementation plan for that report, &quot;<i>A Policing Service for the Future&quot;, </i>a new Garda Digital Strategy has been prepared.  That Strategy &quot;<i>Connect</i>&quot; sets out a series of initiatives which will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deploy the latest cutting edge technologies to better serve our communities and to assist in crime prevention and detection.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the modernisation of PULSE is an ongoing programme of work.  A range of projects are being pursued in that regard. I am informed that some of the key ICT projects which are currently being advanced under the Garda Digital Strategy <i>Connect</i>are as follows:</p><p>- A new Property &amp;amp; Exhibits Management has been deployed and is being used to record all property and exhibits which come into Garda possession and to manage them throughout their lifecycle within the organisation from scene to court.</p><p>- A new Enterprise Content Management System has been introduced which provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a single enterprise content repository for all documentation and certain multimedia content.  A pilot of this system has been completed and rollout to all Divisions will be completed in early 2020.</p><p>- PULSE has been updated to include Individual Victim Assessment and Victim Engagement screens, to record information about the victim themselves and any Garda interaction or engagement with the victim. PULSE has also been enhanced with new incident management functionality which will enable Garda supervisors monitor the progress of incidents from initial data input right through to court outcome stage. This is an interim step pending the implementation of the new Crime Investigations Management System.</p><p>-  A new Crime Investigations Management System will allow for the management of activities completed as part of an investigation, maintain a full history of the chain of events in an investigation, manage information gathered, and decisions/actions taken. It will also integrate closely with the new Document and Content Management System, the new Property and Exhibits Management System, and other Garda IT systems.</p><p>- A new e-Vetting system is operational which provides online processing of applications for Garda vetting for persons working with children and vulnerable persons. This system won the national eGovernment Award for 2017</p><p>- A new Anti-Money Laundering application (GoAML) which supports Financial Intelligence Units to counter Organised Crime and Terrorist Financing and Money Laundering was implemented in June  2017</p><p>- A new Intelligence Management System has been deployed and is operational to provide a single secure repository of sensitive intelligence gathered by operational members</p><p>- A Rosters and Duty Management System is currently being deployed on a phased basis across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>Further and as the Deputy is aware, the Mobility project is ongoing and involves the provision of modern technical facilities to permit Garda members to access PULSE-held data using smartphones.  I am informed that the roll-out of such mobile access will expand in 2020 and beyond.</p><p>In addition, I understand that work to facilitate collaboration and integration with external agencies including as part of the Criminal Justice Hub initiative is also underway.</p></reply>

I am very familiar with the facts of this case and I have the utmost sympathy for the families of the young people murdered on that day as well as for those injured in the bombing. Like the many other callous acts of violence committed during the Troubles, the bombing at Belturbet has inflicted untold suffering on the families of those who died and, indeed, all those affected.</p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities have informed me that the bombing and the murders were comprehensively investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the time. The Defence Forces provided expert assistance and the investigation involved close liaison with the authorities in Northern Ireland. Despite every avenue of enquiry being pursued at the time there was no evidence to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice. It remains a source of disappointment and frustration - most particularly to the families involved - that no one has been brought to account for these murders.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously said, with the passage of 47 years and in the absence of new evidence being forthcoming, I regret that we have to be pragmatic about the prospects for a successful prosecution in this case. Nonetheless, the investigation into the bombing and the two murders has not been closed and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will pursue any new evidence or information that is made available. They would, of course, work in close co-operation with the PSNI where that could advance the investigation. </p>  <p>  I would call on anybody with any information that may be relevant to this case, even at this remove, to bring it to the attention of the Garda Authorities.  </p></reply>

These Standards were developed by an Advisory Group including representatives from UNHCR Ireland and the NGO sector. They provide a framework for the continued development of person-centred, high-quality, safe and effective services and supports for residents living in our accommodation centres. Their purpose is to improve the quality of care and ensure consistency across all accommodation centres. They are being implemented through a tender process that has been running in all regions this year.  Tender specifications include &ldquo;independent living&rdquo;, where people and families can cook their own meals, as one of the main criteria for awarding contracts to accommodation providers.  The tender process will affect all contracted accommodation centres in 2021.</p>  <p>  There is currently a comprehensive system in place for the inspection of all accommodation centres.  As part of this process unannounced inspections are carried out.  The accommodation centre referred to has been inspected 4 times to date in 2019 and 3 times in 2018. No major health and safety matters have been brought to my attention based on these inspections.</p>  <p>  In addition to these inspections, regular clinics are held on site at all international protection accommodation centres by officials in my Department  at which residents can raise any concerns regarding their accommodation.  There is also a clearly defined complaints mechanism for residents as well as recourse to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have and will continue to take into consideration all information brought to our attention and will, through the inspection process, ensure that all contractors are operating their centres in accordance with contractual obligations.</p>  <p>  I should also like to inform the Deputy that the provision of services and supports for residents is kept under review. In that regard, a high level interdepartmental Group, established in my Department, is currently reviewing the implementation of the State's legal obligations under the EU Directive (2013/33/EU) including access to work and the services offered to applicants while their applications are being considered. In addition, an Advisory group, chaired by the former Secretary General of the European Commission, Dr. Catherine Day will advise on the development of a long-term approach to the provision of support including accommodation for people in the international protection process.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would also say that the instances of racially aggravated attacks, mentioned in the report as occurring outside the centre, are abhorrent and are not representative of the views of the vast majority of Irish people.  Indeed, any such incidents should be brought to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Garda staff numbers have increased from 2,055 at the end of 2014 to over 2,900 today. The accelerated recruitment of Garda staff is facilitating the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative to mainstream policing duties where their training and expertise can be used to best effect.</p><p>Taken together, this increase in Garda and civilian staff numbers means a significant increase in operational policing hours nationwide in recent years. </p><p>The unprecedented funding of &euro;1.882 billion provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Budget 2020 will also allow for the recruitment of up to 700 new Garda&iacute; and additional Garda staff next year. The appropriate balance between Garda&iacute; and Garda staff will be for the Garda Commissioner to determine, on the basis of operational need. The ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service nationwide.</p></reply>

This was one of a number of courthouse projects delivered as part of the Courts Public Private Partnership Bundle project.</p>  <p>  I can further inform the Deputy that Drogheda Garda station is among the stations undergoing major works under the Building and Refurbishment Programme, which is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which is responsible for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. Additional maintenance spending is undertaken by the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the upkeep of the stations across County Louth and east County Meath under this programme.</p>  <p>  The resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached record levels, with an allocation for 2019 of &euro;1.76 billion and this is due to increase further to an unprecedented &euro;1.88 billion for 2020.  The capital budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also been significantly increased - a total of &euro;92 million was provided this year, representing a 50% increase on capital investment in 2018. And capital investment will increase further to &euro;116.5 million in 2020.  Capital funding between 2016 and 2021 includes investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021; and investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet over the same period.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-18a.544.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800084#WRK05200"><p>Since the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, my Department and its agencies have worked to put in place a wide range of Brexit supports for businesses. My Department's focus is on helping firms to improve their competitiveness and innovation, and to diversify markets. </p><p>The suite of enterprise and finance supports now in place covers the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months.</p><p>Since 2016, my Department and its agencies have worked to prepare Irish businesses for the potential challenges posed by Brexit by helping them to assess their preparedness and helping them to implement practical action plans in areas such as customs, supply chain and sourcing, and financial management. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying and managing key risk areas and develop practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s suite of Brexit supports includes preparedness vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets and innovation supports through Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland. Supports and advice are also available from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Skillnet Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Bord Bia and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  </p><p>The most immediate consequences of a hard Brexit are likely to be currency movements, supply chain constraints, delays, duties and tariffs. In the first instance, there will be a strain on the working capital position of businesses.  </p><p>Of my Department's suite of supports, the &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme is designed to address working capital challenges brought about by Brexit. Under the Scheme, loans of up to &euro;1.5 million are available at a rate of 4% or less, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available on an unsecured basis. By contrast, the &euro;300m Future Growth Loan Scheme is designed to support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  </p><p>InterTradeIreland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 5,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  </p><p>ITI offers Brexit Planning Voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enable businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.  </p><p>ITI Brexit Planning Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p><p>In August, ITI launched a new advertising campaign and a new online resource to encourage and assist firms in preparing for Brexit. The online &ldquo;Bitesize Brexit&rdquo; resource is a one-stop-shop for cross-border traders, presenting information in easily digestible segments and includes specific actions businesses should take in preparing for Brexit.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland also recently launched 12 &lsquo;Brexit Essential&rsquo; questions aimed at helping exporting businesses further prepare and take action ahead of the UK&rsquo;s impending withdrawal from the EU.  </p><p>My Department, in association with the Department of Education and Skills and key industry partners, has also launched a new support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements due to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. The new initiative, called Clear Customs, comprises a training programme and a customs financial support to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning new staff to customs roles.</p><p>In addition, the Government has held over 100 Brexit information seminars and events since last September. I also have been convening regular roundtable discussions with the main retail grocery and distribution players since December of last year to better understand contingency planning within the sector on food supply. Revenue, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, Dublin Port and relevant Government Departments also attend these meetings.</p><p>With the deadline for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU having now shifted to 31 January, and with the general election now behind us, Brexit continues to represent a significant challenge for businesses in Ireland. I want businesses, particularly those most impacted by Brexit, to know my Department and its agencies are here to help. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>Uptake at 6 December 2019 unless otherwise specified</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td>       <td>919 applications for eligibility received, 828 approved by SBCI, 219 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;47.5 million.<br /><br />Of the approved applications to date, 160 were reapplications as eligibility expires after six months.<br /><br />Data as of the 12th December 2019</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Future Growth Loan Scheme</td>       <td>2,506 applications for eligibility received, 2,350 approved by SBCI, 650 loans progressed to sanction at bank level.

My Department and I are doing everything we can to increase and deepen FDI across the country. The energy and resources we have invested into that objective is, as the evidence illustrates, producing results. </p>  <p>  In 2018, for example, the IDA delivered 113 regional investments with 56% of net new jobs created outside Dublin. The last four years have seen 44,500 new FDI-driven jobs created outside the capital. We will do our utmost to encourage further such job growth across all parts of Ireland in 2020 and beyond.</p>  <p>  The site that the Deputy is referring to is the IDA Ireland Business and Technology (B&amp;T) Park which is located in Ardmore, Mullingar. The park comprises 27 hectares with 22.5 hectares available for investment. The site is fully zoned and serviced and there is currently one IDA client located there, namely Patterson Pumps. The IDA continues to actively market this B&amp;T Park through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. </p>  <p>  The IDA currently does not have plans to construct any new facilities at this B&amp;T Park in Mullingar. However, the Agency keeps its property programme under continual review and will continue to do so into 2020. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the FDI trend in Westmeath is positive. There are currently 21 IDA client companies located in the County, employing 3,466 people. Three of these companies are located in Mullingar, employing approximately 150 people. The wider County has seen an almost 17% increase in FDI employment from 2017 to 2018 and the IDA actively engages with its client base to support them in growing their business and footprint further.</p></reply>

It is available for collaborative projects seeking investment in the development and deployment of disruptive innovative technologies and applications, on a commercial basis, targeted at tackling national and global challenges.</p><p>While the fund was launched in 2018, the successful projects under Call 1 were announced in December of that year with payments due to fall in 2019 and subsequent years. Accordingly, the Government committed an initial tranche of &euro;180m over the first four years, with funding to be allocated each year from 2019 to 2022, as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>DTIF </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;20m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;30m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>&euro;40m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022</td>       <td>&euro;90m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As each project funded is a multi-year project of up to 3 years, the capital allocated to projects to date is reflective of this.

The Fund forms a key part in the delivery of the Pillar 1 goal of Future Jobs Ireland to embrace innovation and technological change. </p>  <p>  In establishing this Fund under the National Development Plan, the Government wanted a competitive and challenge-based programme that would see investment in the research, development and deployment of disruptive technologies and applications on a commercial basis and drive collaboration between Ireland&rsquo;s world-class research base and industry as well as facilitating enterprises to compete directly for funding in support of the development of these technologies.  </p>  <p>  In developing the Fund, my Department consulted with the enterprise and research communities both at home and abroad with a view to identifying the most appropriate type of scheme to introduce. Arising out of these consultations, the DTIF was established to optimise collaboration between our excellent enterprise and research communities in complement to existing development and innovation funding supports. By focusing on industrial rather than fundamental research, it ensures that projects can be developed closer to commercial application within a shorter time period than would be possible with a fundamental research project. It also meant that SME partners could be integral participants. With this Fund, SMEs are enabled to collaborate with other enterprises including multinationals and the research community on their innovative solutions to global challenges, helping to create the jobs of the future and deliver real economic impact for Ireland.   </p>  <p>  The DTIF is complemented by a range of other programmes under agencies of my Department and other Departments that support basic/fundamental research, and in the case of Science Foundation Ireland, oriented basic research.</p></reply>

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, the employment permits system offers a conduit into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills and is operated as a vacancy led system.   </p>  <p>  Ireland operates a managed employment permit system through occupation lists, namley the critical skills and ineligible occuaptions lists, which are reviewed twice yearly. This is an evidence based process that takes account of labour market conditions and submisison from sectors and other stakeholders together with contextual factors. The purpose is to maximise the benefits of economic migration while minimising the risk of disrupting the Irish labour market. </p>  <p>  Since March 2018, all chef grades with experience, with the exception of commis chefs, have been eligible for an employment permit, today I have removed the commis chef grade, with two years&rsquo; experience, from the ineligible list, thereby extending eligibility for all chefs grades to the system.</p>  <p>  Chefs account for the highest number of vacancies in the hospitality sector and the shortage of commis chefs is feeding into shortages at higher and specialist levels, this announcement today will ensure that the capacity gap in filled in the short-term through the employment permit system.</p>  <p>  Taking into account the pressures on the sector, I have decided that the occupation of chef will no longer be subject to a quota, previously there was a  quota of 610.  This change will be kept under regular review to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the labour market opportunities for those in the industry within Ireland and across the EEA and those exiting training programmes seeking employment in the sector.</p>  <p>  In addition, the current cap of two permits per establishment is no longer applicable.</p></reply>

The Government's investment will contribute towards the achievement of Goal 1 and Goal 2. </p><p>- In December 2019, the Government made a supplementary contribution of &euro;5 million to ESA to fund ongoing industrial contracts between ESA and Irish companies to develop innovative technologies and services for the space market, in areas including Earth Observation, Launchers, Technology Support and Telecommunications. This supplementary investment will enable the Government's 2020 Exchequer allocation for ESA to fund new industrial activities between ESA and Irish companies, supporting the aims of the strategy to expand an economically sustainable space-active industry in Ireland.  </p><p>- As of December 2019, there are 70 companies engaged with ESA and the strategy is on track to achieve Goal 2 by 2025. </p><p>- To support the achievement of Goal 4 and Goal 5, the Minister for Training, Skills, Innovation, Research and Development, Mr. John Halligan T.D. and my Department engaged with, and promoted National Space Week in collaboration with Blackrock Castle Observatory. </p><p>- A space industry day, where Irish companies engaged with ESA and three space prime companies, was hosted by Enterprise Ireland on 10 October 2019. Further activities are currently under development, in order to support the achievement of Goal 6. </p><p>- The Department is currently making preparations to establish the Space Enterprise Coordination Group.  This interdepartmental group will oversee the strategy and raise awareness across Government of the benefits and opportunities presented by space.</p></reply>

Typically, the Department and its Offices are in shared accommodation, either with other Departments, public bodies or the private sector. The current staffing cohort of the Department and its Offices totals 925 staff in 11 locations across the country. </p><p>The Department works closely with OPW colleagues to ensure the provision of appropriate, fit-for-purpose accommodation that complies with health and safety legislation for our staff, external contractors and visitors to our buildings including members of the public. </p><p>My Department has a dedicated Health and Safety Unit, with designated responsibility at Principal Officer level. The unit&rsquo;s role is to provide advice to all staff on matters relating to health and safety at work, undertake frequent audits of our occupied buildings and to advise senior management on or take any precautionary action(s) it deems fit in order to minimise the likelihood of accidents on our premises. In any organisation of such a scale which also interacts with the public, there will invariably be periodic slips, trips, falls and other accidents on or in the environs of our occupied premises. Such accidents may result in personal injury claims being taken. </p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) is the State body which provides asset and liability management services to Government. The NTMA is designated as the State Claims Agency when performing the claims management, risk management and legal cost management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 and the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014.</p><p>Therefore, all management of alleged injury claims are a matter for the State Claims Agency. My Department&rsquo;s role in the handling of cases is to provide information as requested by the State Claims Agency in cases of alleged accidents on Departmental occupied premises. Such cases typically take several years to run their course, particularly where contested through the courts. There are six cases ongoing which are of relevance to my Department. </p><p>Where cases are settled in favour of the plaintiff the State Claims Agency bears the initial costs involved and then recoups from the relevant Department. The recoupments made by the Department to the State Claims Agency the over the period 2016 to date are set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Recouped to State Claims Agency</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>Nil</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>Nil</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;159,785</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>To date in 2019 </td>       <td>&euro;52,101</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Our small and medium enterprises are the largest employers in the economy, with 70 per cent of our workers are employed by an SME, which highlights the crucial importance of Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous businesses to stability and growth in every region. That is why I commissioned the OECD to undertake this detailed review into Ireland&rsquo;s SME and entrepreneurship policies in March 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department will draft a single national strategic document for SME and entrepreneurship policy outlining all planned policy interventions in this field in the medium term. It will include information drawn from the range of existing national policy statements referencing SMEs and entrepreneurship as well as other Department and Agency plans. </p>  <p>  The strategy will set out the policy vision, objectives, targets, lines of action and performance indicators specific to SMEs and entrepreneurship. It will cover all areas of policy intervention and all SME and entrepreneurship populations. </p>  <p>  The OECD&rsquo;s recommendations will be considered in the formulation of a new government strategy on SMEs and Entrepreneurship. I have established a new SME and Entrepreneurship Consultation Group of key stakeholders, with my colleague Minister Breen as chair, to consider the review and areas for action, this consultation is ongoing, and I will announce an ambitious new national SME and Entrepreneurship strategy in due course.</p></reply>

The Task Force report was published in December 2017 and it was suggested that the time-frame for full implementation should be three years. The report made recommendations in 10 different themed areas. It also identified lead agencies associated with each recommendation that would be tasked with developing and/or implementing these as appropriate. </p><p>Since publication of the Task Force report, a number of the recommendations have been incorporated into the service plans of lead agencies for 2018/2019. The implementation of these recommendations has been on-going. A small number of recommendations require further consideration. It is anticipated that the majority of recommendations will be implemented by 2021. Related to this, approval is currently being sought from DPER to establish a Pathfinder inter-departmental unit on youth mental health. </p><p>In addition, the successor document to a Vision for Change also supports full implementation of outstanding Task Force recommendations before December 2020. A full list of updates on initiatives is attached for your information.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Recommendations</th>       <th>Status</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Consultation and Advocacy<br /><br />1.1 - Pathfinder should take a lead in formalising mechanisms to ensure that the<br /><br />voices of young people are fully considered in the development and<br /><br />implementation of legislation, policy and services for youth. The Pathfinder<br /><br />team should develop mandatory protocols which will work to safeguard young<br /><br />people against potential changes in policy that could negatively impact on youth<br /><br />mental health<br /><br />1.2 - Policies involving young people should be published in simple, straightforward<br /><br />language that young people can understand<br /><br />1.3 - A process of youth consultation should be carried out when designing mental<br /><br />health and other support services and facilities for young people<br /><br />1.4 - An independent National Youth Mental Health Advocacy and Information<br /><br />Service should be established.

A submission was created on behalf of the Secretary General of the Department of Health for submission to DPER. Since then there has been considerable communication and work performed in addressing outstanding governance, staffing and funding issues.

Work has been completed to determine the merits of establishing the advocacy service as (i)a separate structure independent of the HSE, (ii) a structure within the Child Ombudsman or indeed (iii) a new NGO agency.

The campaign focuses on 9 protective factors that can help build resilience and improve mental health and wellbeing. <br /><br />Work commenced on adapting the Little Things Campaign to tailor the messaging and make it more relevant to young people, who are also listed within Connecting for Life as a priority group. Using research conducted by online youth mental health service, ReachOut.com, which highlighted key areas of stress for young people the HSE identified 6 issues to include in the new campaign; Exams, Sleep, Digital devices and Bottling up your feelings,  Relationships and Image. <br /><br />Imagery and messaging has been developed for 4 of the key areas and will be made available as poser packs to schools, youth and sports clubs around the country. The messaging has been developed to inform young people about the things they can do to reduce stress and anxiety. <br /><br />The campaign will be promoted on Radio, Social Media and through Digital ads targeting young people through relevant channels. We will be signposting to yourmenalhealth.ie for more information on the topics and will also promote the Childline text and phone option for any young person that might need immediate support. Content on all 6 issues, developed in partnership with SpunOut will also be hosted on ymh.ie.<br /><br /><div>HSE/USI ReCharge Mental Health Campaign for 3rd Level Students:</div>HSE Mental Health is also funding a new Mental Health awareness campaign with USI to target third level education students. This campaign is due to be launched in University College Cork.  The HSE funding has been used to create a new campaign logo and tagline, three new posters to address the effects that Alcohol, Sleep and Exams can have on mental health and ways to help manage any stress related to those issues. A new leaflet with more information on protective factors and ways to seek help will also be produced as well as content on both USI.ie and yourmentalhealth.ie.

As part of this implementation a mental health midwife is also being recruited for each of the maternity hospitals/units with two for the four larger services, those with over 8,000 deliveries per year. Apart from the perinatal psychiatrists heading up each specialist hub team who are directly trained in the speciality, all other staff will require training in perinatal mental health.

These pilots encompass the following: <br /><br />(1)        Remote consults to address CAMHS waiting lists.<br /><br />(2)        Remote consults on national adolescent addiction and substance abuse service.<br /><br />It is also envisaged that a third pilot may be undertaken to assist reducing remote access and creating additional capacity and remote team consultations.</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Schools And Youth Mental Health<br /><br />5.1 - The Department of Education and Skills should support teaching professionals<br /><br />in schools and centres for education with the knowledge and skills to understand<br /><br />their role in supporting young people with mental health issues and how to access<br /><br />information about services and supports available to them.<br /><br />5.2 - Principals and teachers should be supported to implement the wellbeing junior cycle curriculum.</td>       <td>The Department of Education have recently made changes to the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Curriculum. Additional hours have been allocated to mental health and awareness. <br /><br />There are now 400 hours of Wellbeing education in the Junior Cycle curriculum. Indicators of wellbeing are embedded into all subjects.  A key strength of the these reforms is that young people will write up a report, report back on their learning, and earn a certificate.

An evaluation piece is needed and HEI will provide input as to what additional counselling might be required before a final submission will be made.<br /><br />Department of Education agreed a package of &euro;57 million in additional current funding to be invested in higher education initiatives in 2019 alongside &euro;41 million additional funding for pay deals and pensions in the sector. This will fund provision for 3,500 additional places, initiatives to support innovation and performance awards, teaching and learning capacity, 1,000 additional places on Springboard+, research funds for Institutes of Technology/TUs, part-time and flexible learning. There will be also be a strengthening of counselling services in higher education. Total funding in higher education will be &euro;337m higher in 2019 than in 2016 (current funding increase of &euro;260m since 2016 and capital funding increase of &euro;79m since 2016). Capital investment of &euro;150 million will also be allocated to the higher education, further education and training and research sectors in 2019.<br /><br />HSE Mental Health is also funding a new Mental Health awareness campaign with USI to target third level education students. This campaign was launched on the 12 November 2018 in University College Cork.  The HSE funding has been used to create a new campaign logo and tagline, three new posters to address the effects that Alcohol, Sleep and Exams can have on mental health and ways to help manage any stress related to those issues. A new leaflet with more information on protective factors and ways to seek help will also be produced as well as content on both USI.ie and yourmentalhealth.ie.

I will have more detail once I meet with Tusla. <br /><br />Part of the recommendation refers to recruitment of HSE leads but the job specifications for full time staff are hard to define.

Recent years have seen growing recognition of the importance of parental mental health and the need for more integrated and effective service responses to parents with mental illness and their children (Wilson et al., 2010; HSE, 2015). This research aims to:<br /><br />1.         To identify mental health services in Ireland that currently deliver, or are interested in developing and delivering family-focused intervention(s) for families where a parent has a diagnosed mental health problem (and their children aged 0-18 years). <br /><br />2.         To subsequently investigate in more detail the implementation and effectiveness of selected interventions in order to inform a &lsquo;think family&rsquo; care delivery agenda in Ireland (and internationally).</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. </p><p>Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. </p><p>My Department is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. The National Service Plan 2020 will set out HSE planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to improve access to inpatient/daycase treatment and with a particular focus on hospital outpatient services. </p><p>In relation to the specific queries regarding children in County Wexford, the NTPF has provided the data requested for Outpatient, Inpatient /Day Case, ENT and Tonsils waiting lists, in the following tables.</p><p>With regard to children in County Wexford who are waiting for a diagnostic appointment, the HSE advise that a pilot project was commenced in 2016 by the HSE Acute Hospitals Division to progress the collection of national radiology waiting list data. The project has been supported by the Radiology Clinical Care Programme and has involved key stakeholders across the system including the National NIMIS Team, Hospital Groups, and the support of the National Treatment Purchase Fund for data collection and data management expertise </p><p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) further advise that they do not currently store patient demographic data (including names, addresses or dates of birth) for patients on the Diagnostics waiting list and hence do not have the data to provide an answer to this query. The Diagnostics waiting list data is aggregated to provide a National Level overview of the number of patients waiting for modalities of CT, MRI and Ultrasound. The data is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnostics waiting lists.</p><p>In relation to the number of children in County Wexford awaiting an NTPF appointment,  the NTPF works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. </p><p>The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List.

This initiative will support the commitment by the HSE and my Department to alleviate winter pressures in our  hospital system. Hospitals have been invited to make submissions to the NTPF to utilise this funding. To date, the NTPF has approved in principle, subject to appropriate governance and oversight, 172 additional beds including an additional 20 beds in CUH. </p>  <p>  These beds will be funded from the NTPF budget at a cost of approximately &euro;4.6 million. Furthermore, the NTPF is currently assessing further proposals which are still being received. Given the challenges facing the Emergency Departments, with the exceptionally high use of trolleys for patients, I would urge all hospital groups and individual hospitals, which have not already done so, to engage with the NTPF to identify proposals to provide additional bed capacity for the winter period.</p></reply>

This funding will support the purchase and/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues. It will support voluntary organisations that provide:- </p>  <p>  -  transport for people with significant mobility issues, including those requiring specialised  wheelchair accessible vehicles, to day-care or other medical, therapeutic or respite services; or </p>  <p>  -  transport to/from designated cancer treatment hospitals/centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy might be interested to know that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty T.D., has commissioned research into the cost of disability.  The cost of disability can be defined as the amount it costs a person with a disability to achieve the same standard of living as those persons without a disability.  This includes extra living costs such as heating; disability aids and equipment; medical and drug costs; care costs and transport costs.  Following a procurement process, Indecon International Consultants have been commissioned by that Department to carry out this research.  It is hoped that the research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, from a whole-of-Government perspective. </p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability. </p></reply>

This initiative will support the commitment by the HSE and my Department to alleviate winter pressures in our hospital system. Hospitals have been invited to make submissions to the NTPF to utilise this funding. To date, the NTPF has approved in principle, subject to appropriate governance and oversight, 172 additional beds. These beds will be funded from the NTPF budget at a cost of approximately &euro;4.6 million. This will include 25 additional beds in Peamount Hospital to facilitate egress from Naas Hospital, St. James' Hospital and Tallaght University Hospital.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the NTPF is currently assessing further proposals which are still being received. Given the challenges facing the Emergency Departments, with the exceptionally high use of trolleys for patients, I would urge all hospital groups and individual hospitals, which have not already done so, to engage with the NTPF to identify proposals to provide additional bed capacity for the winter period. </p></reply>

Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have also been introduced.</p>  <p>  The recent Agreement on GP contractual reforms will see an increase in expenditure on GP services of &euro;210 million annually by 2023, providing significant increases in capitation fees for participating GPs, and increases in supports for rural practices and practices in urban areas of deprivation.</p>  <p>  Improved family friendly arrangements are an important feature of the revised contractual arrangements, with an increase in the locum rate for maternity and paternity cover, and an increase in the paternity leave allowance from 3 days to 2 weeks. This is in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments.</p>  <p>  In addition, the number of medical graduates undertaking GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 192 filled places in 2019, with a further increase expected next year. In a recent press release, the Irish College of General Practitioners stated it had received the highest ever number of applications for its 2020 GP training programme.</p>  <p>  Currently there are almost 2,500 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme and as at 1 December, 25 panels, or approximately 1%, are vacant. There are no GMS GP vacancies in Newbridge, Athy, Monasterevin, or Kildare town.</p></reply>

Innovation will play an increasingly important role. </p><p>Furthermore, the IPCC&rsquo;s special report on 1.5 degrees distinguished the importance of reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>emissions separately from declining net non-CO<sub>2</sub>radiative gases such as methane/nitrous oxide. </p><p>Currently, the long-term ambition for the agriculture sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. While carbon neutrality has yet to be defined the aim is to balance residual agricultural emissions by increasing carbon-sequestration and increasing fossil fuel and energy intensive materials displacement. The sector is pursuing a pathway towards carbon neutrality, guided by the principle of sustainable intensification, through measures such as:</p><p>- Efficient multi trait animal breeding strategies; </p><p>- Efficient use and recycling of nutrients which optimise nitrogen use efficiency and reduce losses of reactive nitrogen to the environment;</p><p>- Feeding strategies; </p><p>- Support of improvements to animal health and welfare; and </p><p>- Support of ICT in agriculture to aid delivery of sustainable intensification.</p><p>Lastly, my Department in tandem with EPA have commissioned a research project by NUIG to quantify/set out definitions and pathways to improve understanding of approaches to C neutrality consistent with temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.</p></reply>

Deer appear to be a localised issue in many areas.  In this context, there is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner. It is critical that landowners take ownership over this issue and organise properly to implement deer management measures on their lands in the correct and sustainable manner.</p><p>In 2015, my Department, together with the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht, published Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are abundant. The Irish Deer Management Forum was established to implement the various actions listed in the Report. The Forum itself comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, as well as representatives from both Departments.  The Report provides for a review of the workings of the Irish Deer Management Forum after three years.  Both my Department and the Department of Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht are currently examining the future direction of the Forum and its aims in the context of representation on the Forum, agreed work plans and funding mechanisms. </p><p>Adoption of best practice is fully supported by both Departments and the majority of deer management stakeholders. Best practice guidance, adapted to Irish Conditions was published by the Irish Deer management Forum during 2018 and can be accessed via .</p><p>A number of initiatives have been carried out in Co. Wicklow with a view to defining locally-led approaches to cooperative deer management. My Department is currently supporting a project led by the Wicklow Deer Management Partnership and Wicklow Uplands Forum, aimed at improving cooperation between landowners and local hunters. This project builds on previous experience in Wicklow through projects such as the Ballinastoe Deer Management Project, the Calary Deer Steering Group and the Calary/North&ndash;East Wicklow Deer TB survey. These projects provide a good example for other local groups to follow, in areas affected by deer related issues. </p><p>The Manor Kilbride Deer Management Group in West Wicklow has also produced very useful and practical code of practice for landowners, to guide successful deer management implementation on farmland, and to formalise agreements between landowners and hunters. </p><p>The deer grazing assessment protocol developed by the Wicklow Deer Management project in conjunction with Teagasc is an example for a significant methodology developed for measuring the impact of deer in agriculture, and to improve awareness of deer issues among farmers. </p><p>I am encouraging farming groups and local communities concerned with deer population issues to look at the examples from Co. Wicklow and consider how they can follow these in their own areas.</p><p>In relation to forestry, my Department introduced a Deer Fencing and Tree Shelter Scheme to protect forests from predation by deer in 2018 as deer can cause serious damage to trees, particularly in native woodlands. Additionally, my Department has also engaged with the Society of Irish Foresters, Teagasc and Third Level Institutes in the delivery of deer management training to professional Foresters and Contractors through a series of seminars and field training events. This work is ongoing.</p></reply>

Such transitional measures are normal practice between consecutive programming periods, where a gap arises due to any delays in finalising the CAP regulations or a new EU Budget.  </p>  <p>  The first and most urgent regulation is the financial flexibility regulation, which allows the continued transfer of funds between pillars I and II in the year 2020.  This is expected to be adopted shortly. </p>  <p>  The second, more substantial, regulation is quite technical and legally complex as it amends seven existing EU Regulations (including the CAP Regulations) to provide for a one-year transitional period in 2021, with EU funding for 2021 as set out in the Commission Proposals for the MFF 2021-2027.</p>  <p>  Specifically, it provides options for Member States to extend their entire 2014-2020 Rural Development Programmes for a period of one year to 31 December 2021, to extend for the same period only existing multi-annual commitments in the RDP (agri-environment/climate, organic farming and animal welfare), and to introduce new agri-environment/climate, organic farming and animal welfare commitments in 2021 for a period of one to 3 years. The proposal also makes amendments to the Direct Payments regulation to provide legal certainty in the transitional period.  Discussions on this second regulation will continue in 2020. </p>  <p>  I welcome the Commission's proposed transitional regulations, and the flexibility provided within them to allow continuity between the programming periods, as well as the certainty that would be provided for Member States and beneficiaries.  I am continuing to work with the Commission and my European Ministerial colleagues to reach agreement on these important legislative proposals and provide certainty to Irish farmers at the earliest possible date. </p></reply>

In the last two years, my Department has opened a number of new markets for Irish beef including China, Qatar, Kuwait and Ukraine, while at the same time securing expansions in beef access in other markets including Japan and Singapore.  </p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department will continue to pursue the opening of new markets and the enhancement of existing ones. My Department works closely with stakeholders, and is guided by Bord Bia research, in identifying priority markets for its market access efforts.  However, the pace of market access negotiations is generally determined by the importing country, so it is difficult to accurately forecast when a given market will open. </p>  <p>  There is growing demand projected from emerging economies with increasing middle classes and more protein-rich diets. There is confidence that the Irish food industry is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by this expanding demand, underpinned by the success of our efforts and those of the Irish food industry.   </p>  <p>  The role of my Department is to open up markets for the industry and it is then up to the industry, with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to avail of these opportunities. However, the actual levels of exports will depend on a range of factors, including as global supply and demand dynamics, currency fluctuations and individual customer requirements.</p></reply>

It is quite clear that the European agri-food sector will need to play its part in the transition to Europe becoming a carbon neutral continent by 2050. Ireland is committed fully to the European climate ambitions.</p>  <p>  I welcome the ambition of the deal for the agri-food sector, the test will be achieving its objectives without compromising economically sustainable food production in rural heartlands across Europe. While the challenges are clear, there are opportunities also. Farmers must produce food in a manner that protects air and water quality, along with enhanced biodiversity, thus meeting the demands of today's consumer. </p>  <p>  Maintaining a well-funded CAP will be key, and it remains an absolute priority for this Government. This is a critical component towards enabling a just transition to low carbon rural economy, a key pillar of the Commission's new Green Deal.</p></reply>

The proposal also makes amendments to the Direct Payments regulation to provide legal certainty in the transitional period.</p>  <p>  Discussions on the proposal will continue under the Croatian Presidency, and it is expected to be adopted in Summer 2020.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has welcomed the transitional regulation proposals, which will allow continuity between the programming periods. The proposals are at an early stage of discussion and we welcome the clarifications provided by the Commission and the Presidency to date. We will continue to communicate closely with both as the text of the regulations develops over the coming months. In due course, this will allow us to consider, in more detail, the options available to Ireland during the transition period.</p></reply>

In the mechanical grading plants only, there were 420 inspections on 43,000 carcasses across 23 factories.</p>  <p>  During these inspections, officers also monitored compliance with the EU reference carcase presentation specification. To date, in 2019, there has been non-compliance found with the carcase trim specification in relation to one factory. The factory has been named on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  On the spot fines were issued in relation to this non-compliance. Any compensation payments made to a Farmer Supplier, including in relation to issues such as this, are a matter between the Farmer/Supplier and the Processor/plant.</p>  <p>  Regarding the suspension of mechanical grading, this occurred on six occasions and the factories were instructed to revert to manual grading.</p>  <p>  Regarding the publishing of information and trial results, my Department fully endorses and supports  the objective of ensuring a robust system of carcass classification and maintaining the confidence of farmers in it. </p>  <p>  The requirement for the modification trial conducted in Slaney Meats and the subsequent report, &lsquo;Independent Report on the modification trial of the Mechanical Beef Classification System currently in use in Ireland&rsquo;,  was to ensure compliance with the EU legislation regarding a modification to the technical specifications of the current classification system. </p>  <p>  The EU legislation requires that any modification to a system must ensure a level of accuracy that at least fulfils the minimum requirements for an authorisation test. This trial was supervised by an Independent Expert who concluded that the results are beyond what is required in the EU legislation to approve such modifications and he confirmed that this trial significantly exceeds what is required where classification equipment is being modified rather than being authorised for the first time. </p>  <p>  As per the legislation underpinning this trial when evaluating the performance of a classification machine, the machines&rsquo; grades are compared against expert classification officer grades. While there is no requirement in the legislation to compare the performance of the modified system against any other mechanical classification system, for completeness and transparency the report shows the performance of the current system (old machine) when compared to the expert graders, which also should be noted, performed to a very high standard.</p></reply>

No. 12 of 2019), which were signed by the Minister for Housing Planning and Local Government on the same date, these Regulations exempted large-scale peat extraction from planning permission and made the EPA the single competent authority for monitoring large-scale peat extraction through its Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licencing process.</p>  <p>  It was my intention, in bringing forward S.I. No. 4 of 2019, to put in place a robust, streamlined system of regulation for peat extraction, which would provide both high standards environmental protection and certainty for the sector regarding the applicable regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  However, both sets of Regulations were the subject of a Judicial Review brought by Friends of the Irish Environment in April 2019. On 20 September 2019, the High Court set aside both the above referenced Regulations, on the basis that they were incompatible with EU law and were ultra vires under national law. </p>  <p>  The judgment, and potential responses on the part of Government, is being given detailed consideration by my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, together with the Attorney General's Office.</p></reply>

The Digital Skills for Citizens Scheme is an initiative under the National Digital Strategy for Ireland. My Department provides funding to community and not-for-profit organisations to deliver informal basic digital skills training where people attending classes will learn the skills they need to take their first steps to getting online. </p><p>Training is taking place across all counties and is targeted at people over 45, farming communities, small business owners, the unemployed, persons with disabilities and disadvantaged groups. This Scheme replaced and builds on the BenefIT Scheme that my Department operated between 2008 - 2016 which delivered over 157,000 training places.</p><p>Since training commenced under the Digital Skills for Citizen Scheme in 2017, &euro;5.5 million has been invested in providing 10 hours of free basic digital skills training to over 54,000 participants including 20,500 citizens over the age of 65. </p><p>The Digital Skills for Citizens Scheme is improving wellbeing, raising awareness about online services and providing the opportunities for family and friends to stay connected, therefore reducing loneliness as well as achieving cost savings and efficiencies. </p><p>My Department also funds a number of energy efficiency grant schemes that are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Over 400,000 households have carried out energy efficiency upgrades with the help of these grants, making their homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost effective to run. </p><p>The Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme established in 2016 as a joint energy, social and health policy initiative, was designed to objectively measure and validate the health and wellbeing impacts of improving the living conditions of vulnerable people living in energy poverty with chronic respiratory conditions, demonstrating the multiple benefits of energy efficiency. Over 1200 homes in the pilot area have now been upgraded. Older participants have reported that the scheme has been very beneficial to them.</p><p>Under the Climate Action Plan 2019, the Government is committed to implement a carbon tax rate of at least &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, accompanied by a trajectory of increases over successive annual Budgets. This would raise an additional &euro;6 billion that could be invested in decarbonising the economy while also protecting the most vulnerable from the increases in living costs associated with the carbon tax. This commitment will send a strong signal to householders and firms of the need to invest in low-carbon alternatives, where possible. Budget 2020 confirmed a &euro;6 increase in the carbon tax for 2020. This is projected to raise &euro;90 million in 2020, all of which will be ring-fenced to support climate action and protect those most vulnerable.</p><p>This increase applied from midnight on Budget Day to auto fuels but its application to other fuels will be delayed until May 2020, after the winter heating season. The concept of a Just Transition and protecting the most vulnerable are at the heart of the Climate Action Plan. Budget measures which will support Just Transition actions in 2020 included: </p><p>- Using &euro;13m from Carbon tax revenue in 2020 to retrofit the homes of people living in or at risk of energy poverty through the Warmer Homes Schemes. The total 2020 funding available will be &euro;52.8m. </p><p>- Using &euro;21m from Carbon tax revenue in 2020 to make changes to the Fuel Allowance Scheme led by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which will increase the income of households who get the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week (an annual increase of &euro;56).</p></reply>

However, there are complex issues at play in this area, which are understandable given the sensitive nature of the medical data in question.  Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging was not introduced. ​A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017 to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The current level of demand is due to our economic success, growing labour market and reduced labour surplus.  </p>  <p>  Employment Permits Section is working to further reduce the current waiting times of approximately:</p>  <p>  - 3-4 weeks for Trusted Partners, which account for 76% of permits issued this year (down from a peak of 7 weeks).  Trusted Partners are regular users of the service.</p>  <p>  - 10 weeks for standard applications, which account for 24% of permits issued this year (down from a peak of 16 weeks).</p>  <p>  In order to further reduce processing times, the Employment Permits section has introduced a number of operational changes, streamlined processes and implemented ICT solutions.  Additional staffing resources have also been assigned to the section and a fast track training programme has been devised.   </p>  <p>  These processing timelines are good by international standards but they are not where we want them to be. I can assure the Deputy that all available resources are being deployed with the aim of reducing them. Whilst there is still room for improvement in relation to reducing processing times for standard applications, it should be noted that, overall, 76% of all employment permit applications are currently being processed in approximately 3-4 weeks.   </p>  <p>  The number of applications being received by my Department is currently at an 11-year high.  At end November 2019, 17,216 applications have been received, an 11% increase on the same time last year.  At the same time there has been a 24% increase in the amount of applications processed (17,535) compared to the same period last year.  In July 2019, Employment Permits Section processed more employment permit applications (1,828) than during any month in the past 11 years.  Quarter 3 of 2019 was the busiest Quarter in the last 11 years with 5,072 permit applications being processed so the changes currently being implemented within Employment Permits are resulting in higher outputs and reduced processing times.  </p>  <p>  An independent Business Process Review (BPR) has been carried out to identify further efficiencies that can be implemented in the short term and as a first step in the development of a new IT processing system during 2020 which will take advantage of all the new technologies available, including full digitisation.  The Review, which included engagement from key stakeholders, has just been completed with the final report expected in the coming days.  It is anticipated that the implementation of the recommendations of the Review, including the implementation of a new IT processing system, will result in further streamlined processes and reduced processing times.</p>  <p>  My officials have been proactively engaging with customers to notify them of current processing timelines through email, meetings and regular updates on the Employment Permits section of my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Applicants are advised to apply for the employment permit at least 12 weeks in advance of the expected start date so that any impact of the current extended processing timelines on recruitment timeframes is minimised.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the allocation of funding at project level, working in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that, since announcement of Budget 2020, the overall funding for my Department's two principal active travel related programmes is now likely to increase to over &euro;100 million in total.  This improved funding allocation does not include the Bus Connects programme which itself will deliver 200km of largely segregated cycle lanes across Dublin. It also does not encompass various other funding sources that can be supportive of walking and cycling, such as &euro;23 million for 2020 under the Greenways Strategy and funding that is provided outside my Department, like the Urban &amp;amp; Rural Regeneration and Development funds. </p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days.</p></reply>

It provides an assessment which is both specific about short terms actions as well as identifying further work that needs to be undertaken to assist in decision-making for the longer term to 2050. In the case of Dublin Airport only, the study assesses the relative advantages and disadvantages of the operation of Terminal 3 by the existing airport operator in comparison with being operated on an independent basis.</p>  <p>  To ensure that there is an open approach to the options for Dublin Airport, including any decision on a third terminal, a public consultation on the Review has been completed. All of the issues raised during the public consultation, along with the Review itself and any further work carried out as a result of the Review, are now being considered carefully ahead of the making of recommendations to Government. I have had a number of meetings and briefings with officials in my Department relating to the Review and the work carried out as a result of the Review. </p>  <p>  I have had no specific meetings with any other entities or stakeholders, in relation to the potential operation of an independent third terminal at Dublin Airport during 2019. </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.

For this reason there is  limited funding available  for specific improvement grant schemes.</p>  <p>  All specific improvement projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  I understand that Cavan County Council is working on a project appraisal for submission to the Department regarding the R178 Virginia to Bailieborough road.  </p>  <p>  The planning of a scheme to upgrade the Dunancory Bridge on the R194 did receive specific grant funding this year.  Allocations for 2020 will be announced in the New Year.</p></reply>

Section 81 (4)(a) of the Local Government Act, 2001 states that assistance by a road authority under the LIS is conditional on a financial contribution by the relevant parties. </p>  <p>  Section 81 of the 2001 Local Government Act also provides that, after consultation with the Minister for Transport and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, another Minister may make a grant to a road authority in relation to non-public roads in accordance with a Scheme made by that other Minister. </p>  <p>  Therefore State assistance can be provided under the statutory Local Improvement Scheme and up to 2012 my Department did provide ring-fenced funding for this scheme. However, due to the major cutbacks in roads funding arising from the financial crisis, it was necessary for the Department to stop  providing dedicated funding for LIS in 2012 and there was no funding for LIS in that year.</p>  <p>  After that from 2013 to 2017, while there was no separate allocation for the Local Improvement Scheme, local authorities could use a proportion of their Discretionary grant for the Local Improvement Scheme if they chose to do so. The allowable proportion of Discretionary Grant was 7% in 2013 and this was increased to 15% from 2014 onwards.  The reason this approach was taken was that it was considered that Councils were best placed to decide whether to concentrate the limited grant funding available on public roads or to operate a local improvement scheme  for non-public roads.</p>  <p>  In September 2017, my colleague the Minister for Rural &amp;amp; Community Development reintroduced dedicated funding for the Local Improvement Scheme and is continuing to fund the Scheme. In light of the significant funding being put into LIS by that Department and the pressing need to direct resources into maintaining and renewing public roads, it was decided that the option of allocating a proportion of the Discretionary grant to LIS would no longer apply from 2018.  </p>  <p>  While I am open to discussing the position in relation to LIS with Minister Ring, should he wish to do so,  I am loath to divert funding from public roads to non-public roads when funding for public roads is still below the level needed to achieve "steady state" and significant funding is being made available by Minister Ring for the LIS - close to &euro;50 million since 2017.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-18a.1108.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800094#WRU04400"><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) is designed to improve the accessibility and affordability of quality childcare for families.  In replacing the legacy schemes, the Scheme entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.   </p>  <p>  In this way, the NCS aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes, and to appropriately incentivise employment and education or training for parents, a policy objective that is known to benefit child and family outcomes.   </p>  <p>  With regard to income-based subsidies awarded under the Scheme, parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 40 hours per week, or from September 2020, 45 hours per week).  The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; are set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and are comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements.   </p>  <p>  Where a parent is not engaging in work or study, the child will only be eligible for the standard number of hours of subsidy, that is 15 hours per week . From September 2020, this will increase to 20 hours. It is also important to note that the subsidy will only be payable during non-term time. This policy decision seeks to make the best use of finite investment for the highest number of families, to encourage labour market activation, to avoid poverty traps in some instances, and is also consistent with evidence on what is best for children.  Research evidence supports shorter/part time hours in high quality Early Learning and Care services while school attendance also meets children&rsquo;s development needs generally.</p>  <p>  The extra hours available from September 2020 are targeted at supporting children whose parents are not in work or study, and also working families needing school age childcare. They also respond to concerns expressed by one parent groups.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that  the maximum subsidy rates compare very well overall with existing targeted scheme subsidy rates, while acknowledging that the schemes do not lend themselves to easy comparison.</p>  <p>  The benefits of moving to an income-basis for eligibility include clarity, reduction of welfare traps, and equity. Eligibility criteria will now be on a single, clear basis, there will be increased support for progression into employment and retention in employment, and there will be equity in ensuring that low-income working families are not excluded from benefitting from subsidised childcare.</p>  <p>  The new Scheme is based on the principle of progressive universalism &ndash; providing a level of support to all families while providing additional targeted support to families with lower incomes. As a result of this measure, all families will be able to take part in the NCS. This widens participation and removes any potential stigma that may attach to families who benefit from the Scheme, increasing the likelihood that all service providers will choose to participate.</p>  <p>  There may be a small number of cases where a family who is currently receiving the maximum rate for full-time childcare under an existing programme may receive less under the National Childcare Scheme, particularly if their child is in school age childcare  rather than full-time childcare.  In such cases, the family can remain on their current payment in the transition period following the Scheme&rsquo;s launch. I have committed to ensuring that no one loses out in the transition to the new scheme through the &ldquo;saver&rdquo; arrangements. This means that persons registered on the CCSP or TEC schemes before they close, and who retain their eligibility, will be able to remain on them indefinitely.</p>  <p>  New applications for CCSP closed on 15th November, and applications to the TEC schemes will close from 14th   February 2020. Parents using the saver arrangement can move over to the NCS at any point. The Parent Information line can help parents to understand which scheme will serve their family better.    </p>  <p>  I have also directed my officials to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents. The scheme will be reviewed after 12 months and closely monitored thereafter to ascertain if it is meeting its stated objectives.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.</p></reply>

My Department has responsibility for the Community Services Programme (CSP) while the other schemes are under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p>  <p>  The CSP supports qualifying organisations by providing a fixed annual contribution towards the cost of an agreed number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions including a manager where warranted. &euro;32,000 per annum is provided towards the costs for the manager position and &euro;19,033 per annum towards each FTE position.   </p>  <p>  The CSP contribution does not meet the full salary cost of supported posts.  It is a fixed annual contribution that must be co-funded by the organisations concerned from other sources, for example, from income generated from the use of facilities and services provided. Moreover, all internal operational matters, including general employment issues and salary levels relating to CSP supported posts are solely matters for the Boards of those organisations to manage as the respective employers.  Organisations supported by the CSP are obliged, under the terms of the programme, to pay their employees at least the minimum wage level.  </p>  <p>  Indecon Consultants are carrying out an independent review of the CSP programme, on behalf of my Department, which is nearing completion.  The review will examine, among other things, the programme's qualifying criteria and income generation requirements.  It will help inform decisions on the future shape and structure of the programme.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, I have provided over &euro;1 million in additional supports this year under the CSP Support Fund, to help to address the financial challenges faced by many of the smaller organisations supported by the CSP.  </p></reply>

Decision makers (both Deciding Officer and Appeals Officers) would then apply these criteria to all cases that came before them and depending on the circumstances of each case, as assessed by reference to these criteria, an individual decision would be made in each case.  This approach was a precursor to the subsequent development on a tripartite basis of the Code of Practice for  Determining Employment or Self-Employment of Individuals Status under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a code which was subsequently updated in 2007 under the  Towards 2016 Social Partnership Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Chief Appeals Officer has also advised me that she does not as a rule take group decisions based on test cases.  However, she has advised that occasionally, and usually where a number of workers engaged by the same employer are concerned and have individually submitted an appeal, she is asked to make decisions on a &lsquo;sample&rsquo; number of cases. The Chief Appeals Officer has agreed to this approach in very limited circumstances and only with the agreement of both the employer and the workers concerned. This approach has not been adopted during the period of her tenure in any case of an appeal where the classification of a worker as an employee or self-employed is the issue under appeal.  </p>  <p>  This approach can be an efficient way of dealing with issues that are common in appeal cases and where there are a number of workers attached to an appeal. However, the approach cannot compromise the integrity of the appeal process or deny any individual interested party due process. Each individual always has the opportunity of having any evidence in their own case presented to and considered by an Appeals Officer. An individual decision issues in each case,  and can be individually submitted for review to the Chief Appeals Officer or indeed, appealed to the Courts.</p>  <p>  I am advised that in the circumstances the Chief Appeals Officer does not consider that a contradiction has occurred but she is happy to clarify the position as outlined. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements. </p></reply>

This will be achieved through blended delivery, involving increasing the social housing stock by 50,000 homes, through build, acquisition and leasing programmes, and supporting some 88,000 further households through the Housing Assistance Payment and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p><p>A range of housing options are necessary to ensure a supply of accommodation to meet different types of social housing need. Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important contributor to meeting this objective and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 will be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources and funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). The leasing programme secures properties from a wide range of lessors and through the various leasing schemes.</p><p>High quality secure properties, which represent value for money and are available on a long-term basis, are being targeted by local authorities around the country to accommodate people on local authority waiting lists.  The Government has increased significantly the delivery expected from local authorities through their social housing build programme, but it remains the case that more homes can be provided through leasing than could reasonably be expected to be delivered under construction and acquisition programmes alone. In addition, the cost of delivering social housing units under the traditional construction and acquisition model is not adequately captured by the up-front capital expenditure as each unit will carry a stream of ongoing costs over the long-term including management, maintenance and remediation. Furthermore, during the term of the lease, the responsibility for structural matters remains with the property owner and not the local authority.  At the end of the lease term, the dwelling can require major renovation or upgrading resulting in a substantial capital cost, which under leasing is borne by the owner rather than the local authority.</p><p>The Government is committed to increasing the supply of social housing and a primary focus continues to be the construction of new social housing homes. However, it is important that local authorities have the capacity to respond to local residential property markets and that they have the tools to provide a range of accommodation types in all of the areas where social housing need arises. </p><p>HAP, a social housing support being provided by local authorities, is one such tool.  HAP will replace Rent Supplement for those with a long-term housing need who qualify for social housing support. The introduction of HAP means that local authorities can now provide housing assistance for households with a long-term housing need, including many long-term Rent Supplement recipients. At the end of Q3 2019, nearly 67,000 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were more than 50,000 households actively in receipt of HAP support and over 29,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme. However, the introduction of HAP has not resulted in increased usage of the private rented sector by the State &ndash; at end 2018, there were almost 6,000 fewer tenancies supported through Rent Supplement, Rental Accommodation Scheme or HAP than at end 2014, when the HAP scheme commenced.</p><p>HAP is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies. Budget 2019 increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;422 million. This is allowing for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019, as well as supporting the roll-out of the Homeless HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country. With 68,693 households on our waiting lists, the combination of 50,000 social housing homes and 88,000 HAP and RAS supports, which will be funded by the Government out to 2021, means that both long term and flexible options will be available to those on our social housing waiting lists.  </p><p>Details on the Exchequer funding for HAP are set out in the table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Outturn</td>       <td>&euro;152.69m</td>       <td>&euro;276.6m</td>       <td>&euro;422m (allocated)</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Budget 2020 increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;502.7 million. This will enable a further 15,750 households to be supported, as well as continuing support for the over 52,000 existing HAP tenancies which will be in place at end 2019. The 2021 budgetary provision for housing programmes will be determined in the context of the relevant estimates process.</p><p>During the period 2016-2018, the housing needs of some 91,000 households were supported under current programmes, including the HAP and RAS schemes. This figure includes continuing to provide support to those already in homes supported under the programmes concerned, and also the additional tenancies established during that period. If the funding provided for these 91,000 households had been transferred to capital expenditure, to support building or buying homes, it would have secured some 5,500 homes, leaving no resources available to support the other 85,500 households.

Ireland signed up to the Agreement in 2003.   The agreement includes a commitment that &ldquo;Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables."  This is because there is slow accumulation of lead from shot in wetlands where hunting occurs.  The lead is generally harmful in the environment and can also be consumed by wildfowl.</p>  <p>  Since the Agreement was signed, the European Commission has published a draft Regulation for consideration by Member States on the use of lead shot in wetlands following a report on the matter by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).  It is my understanding that the proposal, should it ultimately progress into law, would make provision for a lead-in time to facilitate the making of arrangements to source alternatives to lead shot. </p>  <p>  The Department is aware that any change to the regulations around the use of lead in gunshot could provide a range of difficulties to transition to new guns/gunshot for many gun owners in Ireland, including farmers and hunters, as many gun owners could have to make alternative arrangements, in many cases to purchase new guns. </p>  <p>  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and the other relevant Government departments, are fully committed to ensuring that this matter is addressed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, including farmer and hunters, and that all potential impacts are fully considered. This process of consultation is continuing. All proposals will be comprehensively evaluated, including extended lead-in times.  </p>  <p>  My Department recently submitted a document for circulation to the REACH Committee of the European Union suggesting an extended lead-in time to enable hunters and farmers and other stakeholders in the country to make the necessary arrangements and this will be considered by that Committee in the context of future meetings.</p></reply>

The public art investment under the scheme is controlled by defining investment bands and by applying maximum amounts which may be invested.  The funding for the scheme must be met from within existing project budgets. </p><p>Current Guidelines on the Per Cent for Art Scheme are available on the Public Art website www.publicart.ie.

The 10 year strategy sets out a cross-governmental approach to managing issues that relate to peatlands, including compliance with EU environmental law, climate change, forestry, flood control, energy, nature conservation, planning, and agriculture. The strategy has been developed in partnership between relevant Government Departments/State bodies and key stakeholders through the Peatlands Council. </p>  <p>  Action 28 of the National Peatlands Strategy sets out that a peatlands strategy implementation group would be tasked with considering the creation of a national peatlands park. As a starting point for such consideration, an examination was undertaken in 2017 of existing and potential visitor facilities in the ownership of public, semi-state and voluntary bodies. It was found that there were fifteen peatlands sites in Ireland with features to be expected in a peatlands park ranging from community sites such as Abbeyleix Bog in County Laois to larger peatlands parks such as Lough Boora, in County Offaly which is managed by Bord Na M&oacute;na.</p>  <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department intends to undertake a feasibility study in 2020 in relation to the creation of a national peatlands/wetlands park and will continue to engage with the relevant agencies and other stakeholders on the matter.</p>  <p>  The consideration of peatlands as an amenity forms part of my Department&rsquo;s EU LIFE programme funded raised bog restoration project and the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022. The EU LIFE funded raised bog restoration project is supporting amenity development in a number of raised bog special areas of conservation. Planning is at an advanced stage for community based amenity developments in Ferbane, County Offaly and Mountbellew, County Galway, subject to the granting of planning permission.</p>  <p>  The Peatlands Community Engagement Scheme, administered by my Department, has supported the development of a number of community led walking trails and looped walks, local area amenity improvements, education programmes along with a photographic exhibition, environmental surveys, an oral history project, signage, interpretative infrastructure and promotional material in relation to raised bogs in 2018 and 2019.</p></reply>
