The Forum comprises a range of stakeholders including from the farming and food processing sectors, organic certification bodies and relevant State Agencies including Bord Bia. This group will be the forum for discussion on all relevant issues to the Irish organic sector including addressing market demand. </p>  <p>  Minister of State Hackee will be leading a high-level trade mission to Germany this month to coincide with Biofach, the largest organic trade fair in Europe to help promote organic Irish food and drink in the German market.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, to assist in meeting market demand for organic produce, my Department currently offers funding to processors who wish to invest in developing facilities for the processing, preparation, grading, packing and storage of organic products under The Organic Processing Investment Grant Scheme. It is a demand led scheme and all eligible applications received are assessed based on the terms and conditions of the scheme. A budget of &euro;1.2 million has been allocated to this Scheme for 2022 with a maximum payment of &euro;700,000 available on eligible expenditure. </p>  <p>  It is through initiatives like these that we will continue to develop the sector at production and processing level and help meet increasing domestic and export market opportunities for organic produce.</p>  <p>  Oganics is a really exciting sector and is one I will continue to support.  </p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that shortly after the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, I met with the main farm organisations and Teagasc on 8<sup>th</sup>March 2022 to discuss the impact of Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine on Irish agriculture and supply chains. </p><p>At that meeting, I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee and tasked it with preparing an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.  </p><p>Following the first meeting of this Committee, Teagasc issued advice to farmers on how to manage their farms during the current grass growing season with a view to securing sufficient fodder for next winter.  </p><p>The advice includes applying sufficient fertiliser on grassland and crops, on the basis of a fodder budget for winter 2022 so as ensure that sufficient fodder is conserved. In addition, Teagasc commenced a nationwide advertisement campaign giving advice to farmers along with extensive engagement with farmer clients.  </p><p>On the 22<sup>nd</sup>March 2022, I also announced a Targeted Intervention Package, framed around three pillars to support Irish farming families arising both from events in Ukraine and wider global price volatility. The total package is projected to cost in the region of &euro;12.2 million.  </p><p>The Tillage Incentive Scheme has a budget of &euro;10 million. The Tillage Incentive Scheme incentivises farmers to grow more tillage crops, at a payment rate of &euro;400 per hectare. Farmers must increase their overall tillage and protein crops on their holding and the additional land payable under the scheme must have been in grassland and other crops in 2021. </p><p>Support was also provided to incentivise farmers to grow more protein crops, to reduce Ireland's dependency on imported feed. A rate of &euro;300 per hectare for Protein Aid (eligible crops include beans, peas and lupins) and &euro;150 per hectare for the Protein/Cereal Mix Crop Scheme.</p><p>The land declared on farmers' 2022 BPS application is the basis for eligibility for these schemes. The formal application for the Tillage Incentive Scheme and the Protein/Cereal Mix Crop Scheme opened on 27<sup>th</sup>June 2022, with a closing date of 20<sup>th</sup>July 2022. Some 4,000 applicants are eligible for the Tillage Incentive Scheme and some 170 applicants are potentially eligible for the Protein/Cereal Mix Crop Scheme. </p><p>While the area eligible is still subject to change, it is expected to be circa. 25,000 hectares in the Tillage Incentive Scheme and 1,000 hectares in Protein/Cereal Mix Crop Scheme. The budget for both schemes is expected to be fully utilised.  </p><p>The March 2022 package also included a Multi-Species Sward Initiative and a Red Clover Silage Measure, to promote environmentally sustainable methods of farming, and thereby reduce nitrogen fertiliser usage, while maintaining forage yields.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that in addition to the &euro;12 million already mentioned earlier, on the 14<sup>th</sup>June 2022 the Government approved a new  &euro;56 million Fodder Support Scheme  which opened for online applications on the 17<sup>th</sup>June 2022. </p><p>It will remain open for applications until 2<sup>nd</sup>August 2022. The objective here is to support farm families to conserve silage and hay this year to ensure that nationally we have adequate stocks of fodder over next winter. Areas entered by farmers under the scheme must be cut and conserved as hay or silage by Monday 5<sup>th</sup>September 2022. To date, over 24,000 applications have been received under this Scheme.  Payment will be at the rate of up to &euro;100 per Hectare with a 10 Hectare limit. </p><p>I am confident that the various financial supports will assist farmers in providing sufficient fodder for winter 2022.  I remain committed in supporting our farm families through this challenging period. </p></reply>

The latest figures show an increase of 150 million people in 2019 to a staggering level of 829 million people at the end of 2021. </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, conflict and the increasing cost of fuel, fertiliser and feeding-stuff are all impact negatively on the global efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2 target of Zero Hunger by 2030. This distressing level of hunger will inevitably get worse as a result of the illegal Russian war on Ukraine, its use of food as a weapon, the targeting of food facilities and the blockading of grain exports in the Black Sea.</p><p>The UN Food Systems Summit, in which I participated last year, affirmed that foods system hold the power to realise our shared vision for a better world without global hunger, poverty and inequality. </p><p>I am committed to pursuing a sustainable food systems approach both in relation both to Ireland&rsquo;s own agri-food system, and also to my Department&rsquo;s international development cooperation efforts.  </p><p>Food Vision 2030 is the strategy for the sustainable development of the agri-food sector. Both the strategy and its recently published implementation plan, have missions and goals aligned with specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets. </p><p>Food Vision 2030 sets an ambition that Ireland will become a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems over the next decade. The strategy was developed by a stakeholder committee, taking a food systems approach, and recognising the importance of the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. </p><p>Food Vision 2030 sets out four high-level Missions for the sector to work towards:</p><p>1. A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector</p><p>2. Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being</p><p>3. Food that is Safe, Nutritious And Appealing, Trusted And Valued at Home and Abroad</p><p>4.An Innovative, Competitive and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, Driven by Technology And Talent</p><p>Each of these missions is well thought out, with ambitious goals rooted in a strongly practical approach to what needs to be achieved.</p><p>I am leading on the implementation of Food Vision which is already underway, with many of its actions commenced. I have chaired three meetings of the Food Vision 2030 High Level Implementation Committee which will provide leadership in progressing the missions and actions set out in the Food Vision strategy.  </p><p>I believe Food Vision 2030 provides a pathway for a dynamic, sustainable and innovative agri-food sector ready to adapt and to embrace change for a more sustainable future.  </p><p>I am confident that, with Food Vision 2030 as a strategic framework, Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food sector will achieve its ambition to become a world leader in sustainable food systems. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-14a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400064#WRA01600"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, all sectors of the economy will have to deliver on challenging targets in order to achieve the economy wide 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. </p><p>The agriculture sector will need to reduce emissions by between 22% to 30% by 2030, this will require signficant change across each one of our 140,000 family farms. I have been clear that a whole-of-sector, whole-of-government approach will be needed to achieve our objectives. Regulation, public supports and incentives, in conjunction with private industry supports will all an important role. </p><p>In terms of public supports, the CAP Strategic Plan, which is currently going through the approval process, will undoubtedly be a key pillar of the State's climate action support. The CAP Strategic Plan will provide &euro;9.8bn of support the economic, environmental and social sustainability for  farmers and rural communities. </p><p>Key elements of this plan include: </p><p>- a new Eco-scheme. This scheme has a number of climate- and environment-focused farming practices, which will be open to all  farmers. These include practices aimed at reducing chemical nitrogen usage, increasing tree planting, increasing nature- and biodiversity-rich land areas and encouraging extensive livestock production; </p><p>- an ambitious new Pillar II environmental scheme, the ACRES scheme, targeted at 50,000 participants. This will be underpinned by a greater focus on <i>results-based actions</i>and on <i>collective actions</i>aimed at achieving landscape-scale benefits; </p><p>- an Organic Farming Scheme aimed at more than tripling the area of agricultural land that is farmed organically;</p><p>- A suckler carbon efficiency scheme which will contribute to the objective of early finishing times of our prime beef cattle. This will reward farmers with a payment of &euro;150/cow on the first 10 cows, compared with &euro;90/cow on the outgoing BDGP.</p><p>In addition, I established two Food Vision 2030 working groups on dairy and on beef and sheep meat which will set out a clear roadmap to enable the sectors reduce emissions. </p><p>I have already committed support, such as through supporting Soil Sampling to measure soil carbon, support for low and indeed in some cases, no Nitrogen crops such as Multi-species and Red clover mixes. </p><p>I will work with industry to ensure that their sustainability payment supports fully align with our public supports. By taking this coordinated approach, I am confident the sector will be able to achieve its climate objectives. </p></reply>

I believe there is potential to develop anaerobic digestion on Irish farms, especially considering the current global energy crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  It should be noted however, that energy policy formation, including renewable energy, is the direct responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC). However,   my Department is engaging with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on all energy related matters from an agricultural perspective, as well as a wide range of industry and other stakeholder groupings. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with farmers and other relevant stakeholders as part of its regulatory role in the Anaerobic Digestion industry specifically when animal-by-products are utilised as a feedstock for Anaerobic Digestion. There are currently 12 anaerobic digesters producing biogas in operation nationally that are approved and under license by my Department.</p>  <p>  The development of an anaerobic digestion industry in Ireland must be based on scientific research and country specific data. To this end, my Department continues to support research, development and demonstration in this particular area. </p>  <p>  Two projects in particular which have received part-funding from my Department through the European Innovation Partnerships initiative (EIP), as part of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 will provide this much needed information.  The Bio-refinery Glas (small scale farmer-led green bio-refineries) and Irish Bio-energy Association (IrBEA) (small biogas demonstration programme) have both been awarded funding of over &euro;900,000 each.</p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing the results of these projects which will provide valuable information of specific relevance to Irish farmers. The development of an AD indsutry could be a strong new income stream for farm families too. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-14a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400064#WRA02200"><p>I am very conscious of the impact on the agri-food sector of increased input costs, and particularly price rises in the energy sector, which have been amplified by Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine. I have worked to deliver measures and supports for our farm families who have been impacted by the increased costs of inputs as a result of the illegal invasion of Ukraine. </p>  <p>  I meet with stakeholders on an ongoing basis to discuss the impact of the Ukraine crisis on Irish agriculture and supply chains.  Since the invasion of Ukraine started, I have announced a number of measures, valued at &euro;91 million, to assist the agri-food sector.  These targeted measures will help Irish farmers at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the situation in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  While primary responsibility for the taxation of fuel lies with the Minister for Finance, I continue to work closely with him to ensure that the tax code reflects the Government&rsquo;s priorities for the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, gas oil that qualifies for a reduced rate of Mineral Oil Tax is marked green and is usually referred to as Marked Gas Oil (MGO), green diesel or agricultural diesel.</p>  <p>  Mineral Oil Tax is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. Following reductions applied by the Minister for Finance to the non-carbon component of the tax this year,  the current rate of Mineral Oil Tax on agricultural diesel is &euro;111.14 per 1000 litres. This compares very favourably to the current rate applied to auto diesel which is &euro;405.38 per 1000 litres.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of farming or the trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.</p>  <p>  I also note that Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, as amended, provides further relief on expenditure incurred by farmers in respect of an increase in the carbon tax on farm diesel. </p>  <p>  I continue to engage with all our stakeholders and continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. I am taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  We must protect our agri-food sector and farm families through this period of significant upheaval. </p></reply>

The Forestry Licensing Plan was  published at the start of the year and sets out a range of forestry priorities for 2022.</p>  <p>   As regards progression towards our overall target at the end of Quarter 2 up to 30th June, 2,449 licences have issued, just short of the projected average of 2,635 at 93%.  It is, however, inevitable, in the context of the annual target figures, there will be fluctuations in licence output and across categories from week to week.</p>  <p>  Across the individual categories of private felling, Coillte felling and roads we are close to or above our projected target. I acknowledge that we have not reached expected levels in relation to afforestation at 57%.

The full impact of these measures and of this recruitment will become evident from now on. Training of these new staff and the requirement for Second 30 day public consultation period for those sites subject to Appropriate Assessment has delayed output to date, but I am hopeful that the second half of the year will see an increase in the number of afforestation files issued</p>  <p>  In addition, to ensure efficient use of resources and similar to other planning authorities, files with outstanding further information requests back with the applicants over a set time will be removed from the licensing worklist. Reminders will always be sent to applicants to make them aware of the situation with their file.</p>  <p>  In the interest of full transparency details of all licences issued by category are available on the weekly dashboard. This is published on my Department's website and is made available to all interested parties as well as being submitted to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine each week.</p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsbility for the sector, it is my  firm commitment to meet the targets as set out in the Licencing Plan and to deliver for the forestry sector in Ireland. </p></reply>

In addition, the Report focuses on practical and implementable options for streamlining processes and procedures, having regard to arrangements in other European countries, and the constraints imposed under EU law as interpreted by the Courts.</p><p>My Department is now developing an action plan for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report, with the implementation of certian recommendations already under way.</p><p>Work is also on-going with the implementation of  the 57 recommendations arising from a business process review carried out under Project Woodland. An Agile Implementation Group is implementing  system solutions, including new functionality, arising from that review, with 39% of all recommendations either complete or in progress..</p><p>This work builds on earlier improvements to our processes. These improvements have facilitated the preparation of  Appropriate Assessment Reports  by my Department, which  removes this burden from applicants in most cases.  Associated with this and in order to assist foresters in submitting quality applications, we recently provided habitat map training  and we are shortly due to roll out training specifically for ecologists. Furthermore, a pre-application discussion pilot has been completed and we now intend to deliver this at a national level.  All of these measures are aimed at improving the quality of applications received, and  at opitmising the time of those assessing applications.</p><p>Furthermore, in tandem with looking at processes, I have substantially increased the resources available to process forestry licences, with 35 ecologists now dealing with licence applications. </p><p>I believe these efforts have had a positive impact as we have issued 2,449 licences to end June which is 93% of our projected average at this point in the year. As regards addressing the backlog, my Department has 3,148 applications on hand. Since 1st January, this figure has reduced from 4,800 and from 6,000 in August 2021.This is significant progress. The number of applications now in backlog i.e over 120 days now stands at 2,573.</p><p>We will continue to focus on improvements to the system and to assist those who are engaging with it by means of improved communication and training.</p></reply>

In 2022, I secured a budget of &euro;21 million which represents a &euro;5 million increase in allocation from 2021. The additional funding provides for an extra 50,000 hectares converting to organic production in 2022. I have also reduced the required stocking rate and increased the cap on the higher rate of payment from 60 hectares to 70 hectares.</p>  <p>  Furthermore under the new CAP, I have proposed the allocation of &euro;265 million in funding - this is a five-fold increase for the budget for organics. Based on this level of funding, it is my intention to implement enhanced payments to organic farmers to support the maintenance and conversion to Organic Farming. I believe these changes will attract strong numbers of new entrants to the organic farming sector.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Pippa Hackett has reconvened the Organic Strategy Forum which has met three times so far in 2022. Currently, the forum is developing a road-map of activities in advance of the scheme reopening in late 2022 to promote the pathways to organic farming.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Hackett is also undertaking a trade mission to Germany in July 2022 to coincide with Biofach, the largest organic trade fair in Europe.  This will enable organic client companies to build new business and generate new leads and ensure that all efforts are undertaken to expand the export market for Irish Organic produce.</p>  <p>  To ensure farmers have the help and support to transition to organic farming, my Department has provided funding to the Agricultural Consultants Association to increase advisory support in the sector and Teagasc are committed to continuing their support of organic farming through their advisory service. </p>  <p>  I believe that these measures are having a positive effect as we saw a 20% increase in applications to join the Organic Farming Scheme in 2022 in comparison to 2021, bringing in an expected additional 17,000ha of land giving an overall increase of 35% of land being farmed organically over the last two years. I intend that this will be the first of many increases in the volume of land farmed organically in Ireland. </p></reply>

Given the large number of recommendations and the work required to examine each from the perspective of funding available, eligibility under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve Regulation, State Aid rules, and the Public Spending, the Task Force recommended that its 16 recommended schemes be considered on a phased and prioritised basis. </p>  <p>  Since the publication of the Task Force Report, many of the recommended schemes have since been launched. The first of these was a Brexit Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme which ran from October to December 2021. It made available supports of &euro;4,600 up to &euro;88,700 per month depending on vessel size for vessels to tie-up for a calendar month.  Vessels in the Rockall squid fishery could tie-up for 2 months at these rates.  In total, some 179 vessels availed of this scheme at a cost of &euro;10 million. </p>  <p>  I introduced this tie-up scheme again last month and it will operate until November this year.

Already, some 67 vessels availed of the scheme for the month of June, with a further 43 approved for tie-up for July.  </p>  <p>  For the inshore fleet, a Brexit Inshore Fisheries Business Model Adjustment Scheme operated over January to March and was availed of by 771 inshore fishing vessel owners at a cost of &euro;2.6 million to assist in adjusting their business to the post Brexit environment. In addition, a Brexit Inshore Marketing Scheme is underway and is investing &euro;600,000 in 2022 in promoting stocks of interest to inshore fishers to support prices at the quayside.</p>  <p>  Separately, a &euro;45 million Brexit Processing Capital Support Scheme is open for applications at present, with the aim of supporting the seafood processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of Brexit, and assisting the sector to move further up the supply chain to produce higher value seafood products.  Grants of up to 50% for capital investment are available.  </p>  <p>  For coastal communities, a &euro;25 million Brexit Blue Economy Enterprise Development Scheme is open for applications and aims to counter the adverse economic and social consequences of Brexit on businesses operating in the blue economy in our coastal regions.  The scheme offers aid of up to &euro;200,000 for capital investments and also offers aid for training and mentoring. </p>  <p>  Additionally, a &euro;35 million Brexit Local Authority Marine Infrastructure Scheme is well underway, with grants of &euro;32 million approved for local authorities to renew important local infrastructure that will facilitate both fishing activities and the growth of our blue economy. </p>  <p>  Further support schemes are anticipated in coming months, with four awaiting State Aid clearance from the European Commission.  This includes a voluntary decommissioning scheme, an off register capacity buyout scheme, a capital support scheme for aquaculture, and a liquidity support scheme for fisheries cooperatives.</p></reply>

The Forestry Licensing Plan was published at the start of the year and sets out a range of forestry priorities set to run for the whole of 2022.</p>  <p>   As regards progression towards our overall target at the end of quarter two up to 30th June, 2,449 licences have issued, just short of the projected average of 2,635 at 93%.  It is, however, inevitable, in the context of the annual target figures, that there will be fluctuations in licence output and across categories from week to week.</p>  <p>  Across the individual categories of private felling, Coillte felling and roads we are close to or above our projected target. I acknowledge that we have not reached expected levels in relation to afforestation, at 57%. However when compared to our output at the same time last year we are slightly ahead.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve our targets, we have improved our systems, and given the number of files required to be referred to ecology, we have recruited significant numbers of additional ecologists. There are 35 full-time equivalent ecologists working on forestry applications with 21 dealing with afforestation. The full impact of these measures and of this recruitment will become evident across the second half of the year. </p>  <p>  Training of these new staff and the requirement for a second 30 day public consultation period for those sites subject to Appropriate Assessment has delayed output to date, but I am hopeful that the second half of the year will see an increase in the number of afforestation files issued.</p>  <p>  In addition, to ensure efficient use of resources and similar to other planning authorities, files with outstanding further information requests back with the applicants over a set length time will be removed from the licensing worklist. Reminders will always be sent to applicants to make them aware of the situation with their file.</p>  <p>  In the interest of full transparency details of all licences issued by category are available on the weekly dashboard. This is published on my Department's website and is made available to all interested parties as well as being submitted to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine each week.</p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsbility for the sector, it is our  firm commitment to meet the targets as set out in the Licensing Plan and to deliver for the forestry sector in Ireland.</p></reply>

In addition, the Report focuses on practical and implementable options for streamlining processes and procedures, having regard to arrangements in other European countries, and the constraints imposed under EU law as interpreted by the Courts.</p><p>The Department is now developing an action plan for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report, with the implemtation of certain recommendation already under way. </p><p>Work is also on-going with the implementation of  the 57 recommendations arising from a business process review carried out under Project Woodland. An Agile Implementation Group is implementing  system solutions, including new functionality, arising from that review, with 39% of all recommendations either complete or in progress.</p><p>This work builds on earlier improvements to our processes. These improvements have facilitated the preparation of  Appropriate Assessment Reports  by my Department, which  removes this burden from applicants in most cases.  Associated with this, and in order to assist foresters in submitting quality applications, we recently provided habitat map training  and we are shortly due to roll out training specifically for ecologists. Furthermore, a pre-application discussion pilot has been completed and we now intend to deliver this at a national level.  All of these measures are aimed at improving the quality of applications received, and  at opitmising the time of those assessing applications.</p><p>Furthermore, in tandem with looking at processes, I have substantially increased the resources available to process forestry licences, with 35 ecologists now dealing with licence applications. </p><p>I believe these efforts have had a positive impact as we have issued 2,449 licences to end June which is 93% of our projected average at this point in the year.  We will continue to focus on improvements to the system and to assist those who are engaging with it by means of improved communication and training.</p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18 metres length overall targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was introduced in March 2019 to give effect to the changes.</p><p>A Judicial Review was taken by two applicant fishers challenging the validity of the Policy Directive. On 6th October 2020, the High Court judgment held that the Policy Directive was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect. As the Deputy will be aware, I appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal and a full hearing took place on 22nd June 2021. Judgment on the case is reserved.</p><p>I also sought an extension on the stay on the order of the High Court, which was granted by the Court of Appeal on 19th March 2021, reinstating the Policy Directive, and which was extended by the Court of Appeal following the full hearing on 22nd June 2021. On 23rd September 2021, the Court of Appeal refused the Minister&rsquo;s application to continue the stay further.

This is a mandatory intervention in the next CAP period for all Member States, and I have instructed my Department to implement it at the recommended 10% of the Direct Payments overall financial allocation for the period. </p><p>This &euro;118million per year will be paid out on the first 30 eligible hectares of every Active Farmer&rsquo;s land, at a rate of about &euro;43 per hectare. The impact of this has been modelled by my Department in August 2021, and the results indicate that approximately 70% of farmers will see a net benefit as a result of this redistribution. This effect will be more pronounced the smaller the farm.</p><p>In terms of a strategic approach to the future development of the sector, the Food Vision 2030 strategy, launched by the Taoiseach and myself last year, sets a vision that Ireland will become a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems over the next decade.  <i></i></p><p>Food Vision acknowledges the central importance of primary producers &ndash; our farmers and fishers &ndash; to the sustainable development of the sector and includes a specific Mission &ldquo;viable and resilient primary producers, with enhanced well-being&rdquo; . </p><p>Food Vision recognises that economically and socially sustainable farmers are an integral part of our rural and coastal communities.  </p><p>It also envisages there being a place in Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food sector for all types of primary producer whether full time or part time, big or small. </p><p>The strategy includes specific actions aimed at improving the competitiveness and productivity of primary producers; increasing the creation of value and distributing it fairly; introducing greater diversification in production systems and incomes; and improving the social sustainability of primary producers.  </p><p>In relation to improving fairness along the food supply chain, the Department&rsquo;s Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) Enforcement Authority is utilising the powers approved last year under the UTP Regulations and has my full support in its efforts to remove the unfairness from trading practices in the food supply chain. </p><p>The draft Bill which I have proposed to establish an Office for Fairness and Transparency in the agri-food supply chain is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny.

Pelagic stocks, such as Mackerel, are managed on an annual or seasonal basis with catch limits set based on allocation regimes developed over many years and related to historical catch records. Amendments to the mackerel policy in 2010 and 2017 were introduced following a full review and public consultation. It should be noted that the 2017 policy is subject to a legal challenge in the Courts. </p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I, as Minister, must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect of the policy, it would require due process, involving an assessment of all issues arising, including a full public consultation. </p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota to the UK by 2026.  This will only increase demands for a higher share of Ireland&rsquo;s Mackerel quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase in the Mackerel quota for any sector in the allocation made available, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the TCA. </p>  <p>  In accordance with policy, there is an allocation of 400 tonnes of Mackerel for a fishery for smaller vessels (under 15 metre vessels) fishing for Mackerel by means of hooks and line.</p>  <p>  The management arrangements, within national policy, for the mackerel hook and line fishery have been on the agenda and discussed with industry representatives at recent meetings of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC). It is important to note that the remit of the QMAC is to examine and make recommendations within Ministerial policy. </p>  <p>Earlier this year, I asked the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) to examine measures to strengthen the management arrangements for the 2022 Mackerel hook and line fishery, within the policy, for my consideration.   A working group involving industry representatives recommended by the QMAC and the Department was put in place and made recommendations for the management of the 2022 Fishery which were supported by the QMAC and which I have approved.   The management arrangements are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. The fishery is now open and the SFPA has advised that as of 11th July 2022, 138 tonnes of the 400 tonnes available quota have been landed to date with a corresponding percentage uptake of 34.5%.</p></reply>

A further four schemes are awaiting State Aid clearance from the European Commission.</p>  <p>  Of all of the recommendations, the voluntary permanent cessation scheme is certainty the most complex.  The Task Force recommended a voluntary permanent cessation scheme for the whitefish polyvalent and beam trawl fleet segments with the objective of removing 8,000 gross tonnes and 21,000 kilowatts of fleet capacity, equivalent to 60 vessels approximately.  The Task Force recommended that special provision be made for tax treatment of the decommissioning scheme payments, similar to the decommissioning scheme that operated in 2008 and that complementary measures for buy-out of off-register fleet capacity be instituted in order to lessen the risk of fishers re-entering the fleet with new vessels.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with the Ministers for Finance and for Public Expenditure and reform, the recommended tax measures were included in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022, which was signed into law on 2 June 2022. </p>  <p>  On 14 March 2022, a State Aid Notification for a Brexit Voluntary Permanent Cessation Scheme was submitted to the European Commission for its consideration.

Stakeholders submitted a total of 45 submissions.</p>  <p>  Following a competitive public procurement procedure, &lsquo;The Agile Executive&rsquo; a consortium made up of experts from Munster Technological University and Donegal Yarns, were appointed in November 2021 to carry out the wool review and examine the submissions received under the public consultation process.</p>  <p>The Agile Executive produced a report on the findings of the review and this report was published on the 1st   July 2022. This report which was compiled independently by The Agile Executive, contains a number of findings and recommendations. One of the main recommendations is the establishment of an industry-led Wool Council to develop and promote Irish wool domestically and internationally and bring together multiple stakeholders to foster collaboration, innovation and scaling activities in the wool sector. </p>  <p>  Following the formation by industry of this Council, I am pleased to announce that my Department will commit funding of &euro;30,000 towards the initial set-up costs. I am very supportive of the  proposal of an industry led Wool Council  which I believe can provide a pathway towards maximising the true potential of this valuable natural resource into the future.</p></reply>

The Forum includes representatives of small-scale and artisinal organic producers and processors. It also includes  Bord Bia as the agency responsible for the promotion and marketing of Irish food, drink and horticulture, is taking a lead role in regard to this .</p>  <p>  In their presentations to the Forum, Bord Bia has committed to helping the organic sector develop by building on their current activities in a way that can benefit the sector through targeted market development and promotional activity. Working closely with their organic client companies through capability development also ensures that they are best placed to capitalise on any opportunities that arise on the domestic or export markets for Irish organic produce. </p>  <p>  Following extensive market research and organic stakeholder engagement over the past year, Bord Bia identified a need to develop a strong promotional platform to support sales of organic products at domestic retail level. With this in mind Bord Bia is collaborating with major Irish retailers to raise awareness of the range and availability of organic produce from Ireland among consumers. Bord Bia has developed digital and in-store promotional materials for the Organics from Ireland campaign, which can be used by retailers to highlight their organic Irish beef, lamb, dairy, seafood, eggs, and prepared consumer foods. </p>  <p>  Irish food markets are an extremely valuable link for consumers to our farmers and food producers and provide an opportunity for all small farmers and food producers (including those certified organic) to sell their produce and connect with their customers. In recognition of this important route to market Bord Bia have a dedicated section of its website which focuses specifically on preparation for direct selling via this channel. It includes a range of advice in setting up a stall/food market and also a useful location tool for consumers to identify their closest farmers market. </p></reply>

This group will facilitate discussions on matters arising from the interaction of the seafood and offshore renewable energy industries, to promote and share best practice, and to encourage liaison with other sectors in the marine environment. Its initial aim will be to agree a communications protocol between these two strategically important maritime sectors.</p>  <p>  I have encouraged early engagement in this process and officials from all three Departments participated in a seafood sector information session, which was held online on 22 July 2021, in order to inform seafood stakeholders of the intentions of the Departments and outline the proposed objectives of the working group. This information session was well attended by fishing representatives.</p>  <p>  It is important that we continue to find a pathway that recognises the value that our ocean territory has for our economy and that balances this with how we harness its natural resources. Food Vision 2030, the agri-food sector strategy adopted as government policy, calls for greater recognition, respect and support for primary producers for their key societal role in addressing our climate and biodiversity emergency. It is essential that the needs and experiences of fishers are factored into the scoping, planning and designing of any offshore renewable energy projects.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the Chairperson of the Seafood/ORE working group was recently appointed and I am assured that the inception meeting of this group, which will include fishing industry representation, will be held at the earliest available opportunity. I encourage effective engagement and cooperation between the Departments, Agencies and State Bodies involved and with the seafood and ORE industries in order to fully understand potential impacts, both positive and negative, co-existence opportunities and displacement considerations, and guide any potential mitigation responses as appropriate.</p></reply>

The Forestry Licensing Plan was  published at the start of the year and sets out a range of forestry priorities set to run for the whole of 2022.</p>  <p>  As regards progression towards our overall target at the end of Quarter 2 up to 30th June, we have issued 2,449 licences, just short of the projected average of 2,635 at 93%.  It is, however, inevitable, in that the context of the annual target figures, there will be fluctuations in licence output and across categories from week to week. </p>  <p>  Across the individual categories of private felling, Coillte felling and roads we are close to or above our projected target. I acknowledge that we have not reached expected levels in relation to afforestation, at 57%.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve our targets, we have improved our systems, and given the number of files required to be referred to ecology, we have recruited a signficant number of additional ecologists. There are now 35 full-time equivalent ecologists working on forestry applications with 21 dealing with afforestation. The full impact of these measures and of this recruitment will become evident in the second half of the year. </p>  <p>  Training of these new staff and the requirement for a 30 day public consultation period for those sites subject to Appropriate Assessment has delayed output to date, but the second half of the year will see an increase in the number of afforestation files issued.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, to ensure efficient use of resources and similar to other planning authorities, files with outstanding further information requests back with the applicants over a set time will be removed from the licensing worklist. Reminders will always be sent to applicants to make them aware of the situation with their file.</p>  <p>  In the interest of full transparency details of all licences issued by category are available on the weekly dashboard. This is published on my Department's website and is made available to all interested parties as well as being submitted to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine each week.</p>  <p>  It remains my  firm commitment to meet the targets as set out in the Licencing Plan and to deliver for the forestry sector in Ireland.</p></reply>

In 2021, I re-opened the Organic Farming Scheme and a total of 317 applications were received. Of these, 300 received approval bringing in approximately 12,000 hectares of additional land under organic production.</p>  <p>  For 2022, I secured a budget allocation of &euro;21 million for the Organic Farming Scheme, an increase of &euro;5 million from the previous year. I introduced changes to the scheme by reducing the required stocking rate and increasing the cap on the higher rate of payment from 60 hectares to 70 hectares.

It is anticipated that these applications will bring in an additional 17,000 hectares of land giving an overall increase of 35% of land being farmed organically since the government took office.</p>  <p>  It is expected the scheme will re-open in October 2022 for applicants to apply under the new CAP. I have proposed an indicative allocation of &euro;256 million to continue the development and growth of the organic sector, which represents a five-fold increase on funding for organics under the previous CAP. </p>  <p>  This level of funding will facilitate enhanced payments to organic farmers across all sectors, which will further support maintenance and conversion to Organic Farming and assist in achieving our target of 7.5% of land cover under organic production by 2027.</p></reply>

It is crucial that we have new blood coming into the sector and I am a stroing advocate of generational renewal. New measures to underpin this support for young farmers are planned for the new CAP from 2023.</p>  <p>  The CAP Strategic Plan submitted to the EU Commission at the end of December 2021 contains proposed support measures for young farmers.  Under Pillar I of the next CAP Ireland has proposed support for young farmers as a priority category under the National Reserve to provide for an allocation of payment entitlements at the national average value on eligible land for which the young farmer holds no entitlements, or topping up low value entitlements held by the young farmer to the national average.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has also proposed utilising the option to implement the Complementary Income Support for Young Farmers.  This scheme will see an additional payment per hectare made to eligible young farmers, subject to a maximum of 50 hectares, for a period of five years.  An amount of &euro;35.5 million will be provided in supports to young farmers each year from 2023 to 2027 under this scheme.  </p>  <p>  This will see average payments of some &euro;175 per hectare to eligible young farmers from 2023-2027, compared to the average payment of some &euro;68 per activated payment entitlement under the Young Farmers Scheme 2015-2022.</p>  <p>  Under Pillar II of the next CAP, it is proposed that a grant rate for young farmers for Capital Investments will be 60% with an indicative investment ceiling limit to be applied of &euro;90,000 per holding and &euro;160,000 per holding for partnership applications. </p>  <p>  This level of grant rate is proposed in order to support young farmers and specifically to enable them to take on any necessary on farm infrastructural improvement work. This 60% grant rate compares favourably to the general 40% rate and is designed to be a significant support for qualified young farmers.</p>  <p>  Additional support to young farmers is also provided under the Collaborative Farming Grant Scheme.  The proposed supports for young farmers under the next CAP will be subject to Ireland receiving EU Commission approval for the CAP Strategic Plan.</p>  <p>  There are also a range of State backed supports for young farmers.  These include strong taxation measures to assist land mobility and facilitate succession and are worth some &euro;200 million per annum. Succession and the early transfer of family farms is supported by Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax and Stamp Duty exemptions. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Succession Farm Partnership Scheme provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to further assist the transfer of land within a partnership structure to encourage earlier transfer of family farms.  Investment and access to land are supported by 100% Stamp Duty Relief for Young Trained Farmers, 100% Stock Relief for Young Trained Farmers and Relief for Long-Term Leasing.  </p>  <p>   I make an annual Budget submission to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on matters related to the agri-food sector including the periodic renewal of relevant taxation measures. </p>  <p>  On access to finance, the Future Growth Loan Scheme which provides long term investment finance was developed with assisting young farmers among its objectives. The scheme has seen strong demand, with 1,285 loans to the value of &euro;153.4m sanctioned to farmers. </p>  <p>   Launched late last year the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme is available through participating banks and credit unions and provides loans to Brexit-impacted Irish businesses for working capital, investment and re-financing. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that this loan scheme which replaces the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, comprising the Brexit Loan Scheme and SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital sub-schemes, is available to farmers and fishers as well as food businesses. To date, 620 loans to farmers to the value of &euro;50.2m have been sanctioned.</p>  <p>  The Land Mobility Service is a Macra na Feirme initiative supported by numerous stakeholders including my Department. The service provides options for landowners and opportunities for young farmers through advice on and facilitation of collaborative farming arrangements. It has been supported by my Department since 2014 and has seen well over 500 arrangements covering approximately 19,000 hectares being facilitated. My Department is engaged with the Land Mobility Service on future support, and I announced a 100% increase in the funding for 2022 to &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  In addition, Teagasc agricultural education activities will continue to focus on equipping young farmers with the necessary knowledge to build successful careers.</p></reply>

This remains the position of the Government.</p>  <p>  The Government has been in contact with the relevant Scottish and UK authorities on Rockall over recent years and intensively since the beginning of last year. </p>  <p>  Through this engagement, the Government is seeking to address the issues involved, reflecting the longstanding fisheries tradition in the area.</p>  <p>  I continue to work closely with Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Simon Coveney T.D. to consider all options for further engagement on the issues involved. </p>  <p>  I received the report of the Seafood Task Force - Navigating Change last October.  Irish vessels have traditionally fished for squid and haddock in the waters around Rockall and the impact of the loss of access to these waters was examined by the Task Force.  The Task Force estimated that, in 2019, the total squid fishery was valued at around &euro;6.6 million.  The majority of squid is taken from the waters surrounding Rockall and this amounted to 1,071 tonnes, valued in excess of &euro;5 million in 2019 and 371 tonnes valued at &euro;1.6 million in 2020.   The estimate by the Task Force of the catch of other stocks near Rockall is &euro;1 million, which generally may be fished outside the waters around Rockall.</p>  <p>  In May, I launched a 2022 Brexit Voluntary Temporary Fishing Vessel Tie-up Scheme, as recommended by the Seafood Sector Task Force. The scheme is an extension of the 2021 Tie-up scheme, with some modifications, and will help mitigate the impacts of quota cuts for 2022 arising from the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  For 2022, eligible vessels may tie up for two, non-sequential months but eligible Rockall squid vessels may tie up for two consecutive months, due to the short length and seasonality of this fishery. </p></reply>

These price rises have significant implications across all sectors, including the agri-food sector. These price rises have been amplified by the impacts of Russia&rsquo;s illegal war in Ukraine.</p><p>Following a strong year for family farm Incomes in 2021, where average family farm income was up by 26% to over &euro;34,000, Teagasc has forecast that a decline in 2022 is now highly likely, as output price increases will fail to offset the rise in production costs. </p><p>Significantly higher production costs will be a feature across all sectors in 2022, with higher fertiliser, feed and fuel prices leading to an increase in agriculture input costs. The current market outlook for output prices is uncertain, with significant upward pressure apparent, but this is unlikely to cover the additional input costs for many farmers.  </p><p>I meet with stakeholders on an ongoing basis to discuss the impact of the Ukraine crisis on Irish agriculture and supply chains.</p><p>Earlier this year, I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee and tasked it with the preparation of a response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs; and to developing contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.</p><p>I  also established a Rapid Response Team within my Department, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response.</p><p>Fertiliser merchants have indicated that there are adequate supplies of fertiliser in Ireland at present. However, there may be issues with availability of certain products at times and importers are active in securing alternative supply lines where necessary. Fertiliser affordability and availability is one of the biggest challenges facing our farmers at present.</p><p>There are sufficient supplies of animal feed at present and importers are actively competing on the global market to ensure that supply continues uninterrupted.  Animal feed stocks and imports are being monitored on a regular basis by my Department. </p><p>Since the invasion of Ukraine started, I have announced a number of measures, valued at &euro;91 million, to assist the agri-food sector including:</p><p>- &euro;56 million Fodder Support Scheme</p><p>- &euro;20 million in two packages for the pig sector,</p><p>- &euro;12 million for the tillage sector and</p><p>- &euro;3 million for the horticulture sector.</p><p>These targeted measures will help Irish farmers at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the situation in Ukraine. &euro;15.8 million of these supports, for the pig and horticulture sectors, are funded from the EU's exceptional support package to support the farmers most impacted by the crisis.</p><p>I and my Government colleagues are acutely aware of the challenges arising for farming households, businesses and the greater agri-food sector, and along with the measures targeted at the agriculture sector we have taken steps across the board at Government level to help address these. These include the increase in the living alone allowance, the package of electricity cost measures and the package for supporting fuel costs. </p><p>My Government colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, when  publishing the government&rsquo;s Summer Economic Statement 2022 last week, indicated that Budget 2023 will be calibrated to balance the need to provide further supports with the need to avoid adding to inflationary pressures.</p><p>I continue to engage with all our stakeholders and continue to work across Government to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. We must protect our farm families and their businesses through this period of significant upheaval.</p></reply>

This Group continues to meet and I will continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on these significant challenges.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, I established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  I launched the 2022 Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign in January in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  This credible roadmap, which I tasked Teagasc in developing, will help alleviate reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser in the longer-term. Teagasc has also issued revised advice to farmers on the recommended application amounts of fertilisers for silage fields to reflect the increase in fertiliser price.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported feed, I announced a package of targeted interventions for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers on 22nd March. </p>  <p>  The package supports the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards lowering demand for chemical fertiliser. Following on from the package of measures announced in recent months to provide support to Irish farmers, I launched a &euro;56 million Fodder Support Scheme on 15th June 2022.</p>  <p>  We continue to closely monitor the evolving situation and is actively engaging with the EU Commission, across Government and with industry as this situation unfolds.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I am committed to supporting our farm families and their businesses through this very challenging period.  </p></reply>

Details of the draft scheme were announced on 21st June 2022 to facilitate preparatory work by advisors. </p>  <p>  As announced, there will be two entry approaches in the proposed new scheme namely: </p>  <p>  - An ACRES General approach, available nationally (outside of the high priority geographical area as defined for the ACRES Co-operation approach), which offers a range of measures (both targeted and general); and</p>  <p>  - An ACRES Co-operation approach, available to farmers in defined high priority geographical areas. Eight areas in the country have been defined by a cross departmental working group as having particular environmental characteristics and farmers in those areas may engage in the new ACRES through cooperation project teams, which have appointed. </p>  <p>  The Terms and Conditions for ACRES are currently being finalised and will cover both ACRES General and ACRES Co-Operation. A draft version of these Terms and Conditions will be available to farmers and advisers before they log on to draft a Farm Sustainability Plan, which forms part of the application.</p>  <p>  ACRES will be open to all eligible farmers within the State for land they hold, including commonage. While most of the commonage land is within the ACRES Co-Operation approach, some will be in the ACRES General area. </p>  <p>  Likewise, while much of the designated land in the State is in the Co-Operation zones, some areas of designated land are in the ACRES General area.</p>  <p>  The new Co-Operation Project teams are currently engaging with local stakeholders in developing their Local Action Plans.

It is estimated that the thoroughbred industry has an annual economic impact of &euro;1.84 billion with direct and indirect employment of 29,000 people, and the greyhound sector provides an estimated 10,000 people with economic benefit.  The thoroughbred industry, in particular, brings a high level of international investment into Ireland. </p>  <p>  Government funding, in addition to supporting these key industries, presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment, leading to a flow of income right through the economy, thereby providing widespread benefits for our society. </p>  <p>  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive at a global level. We are the third biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in the world and estimates place Ireland only behind the United States as the biggest seller of bloodstock by public auction globally. Successive Governments have acknowledged the importance of these industries and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives. </p>  <p>  The support provided by public funds through investment in these industries has enabled Ireland to develop a world class reputation for excellence in horseracing, greyhound racing and breeding. </p>  <p>  The horse and greyhound racing industries receive financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, under Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.  My Department makes payments from the Fund to Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann (RC&Eacute;). In the period 2001 to 2021 a total of  some &euro;1.46 billion has been paid from the Fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  </p>  <p>  Exchequer support provided from the Fund is crucial to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  In Budget 2022 an allocation of &euro;88 million was provided  for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  </p>  <p>  This will be distributed in accordance with Section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, with 80% going to HRI (&euro;70.4m) and 20% to RC&Eacute; (&euro;17.6m).   </p>  <p>  I have no current plans to introduce legislation to provide a separate exchequer funding mechanism for HRI and RC&Eacute; and the industries they support. </p></reply>

Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine led to significant hikes in energy, feed and fertiliser prices and significant concerns around supply chain disruption. </p>  <p>  Earlier in the crisis, I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. This Group continues to meet and I will continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on these significant challenges.</p>  <p>  Within the  Department, I established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  I launched the 2022 Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at Teagasc&rsquo;s Ballyhaise College in January in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  </p>  <p>  This credible roadmap, which I tasked Teagasc in developing, will help alleviate reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser in the longer-term. Teagasc has also issued revised advice to farmers on the recommended application amounts of fertilisers for silage fields to reflect the increase in fertiliser price.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported feed, I announced a package of targeted interventions for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers on 22nd March. </p>  <p>  The package supports the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards lowering demand for chemical fertiliser. Following on from the package of measures announced in recent months to provide support to Irish farmers, I launched a &euro;56 million Fodder Support Scheme on 15th June 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to closely monitor the evolving situation and is actively engaging with the EU Commission, across Government and with industry as this situation unfolds.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I am committed to supporting our farm families and their businesses through this very challenging period.  </p></reply>

Ireland was also the 5th most efficient producer of beef. </p>  <p>  While this study has not been repeated by the Joint Research Centre to the best of my knowledge, there are a number of official data sources that clearly show Ireland's positive performance in this area. </p>  <p>  Teagasc published research in 2021 showing that in 2019, the carbon efficiency of cattle production in Ireland was 12.3 kg CO2 per kg liveweight output, this had decreased from 13.7Kg in 2014. </p>  <p>  For example, the OECD would put the carbon intensity of beef production closer to 40-50Kg per kg output. Similarly, on the dairy side, Ireland was at 1.14kg CO2 per kg FPCM (fat protein corrected milk), the similar figure was 1.23 in 2014. Ireland continues to make incremental gains, in this is incredibly important for the marketing of Irish food exports all over the globe. </p>  <p>  Given the improvements made since the initial EU Joint Research Centre report, I am very confident the carbon intensity of Irish meat and milk production compare very favourably across the EU, and indeed across the globe. This is mainly driven by our pasture based production system. </p>  <p>  However, the challenge is clear, while improving emissions intensity is important, we must also reduce absolute emissions in the sectors  in order to achieve our climate targets in 2030. </p></reply>

The timeline for processing an aquaculture licence varies depending on a number of factors including location, species, scale and intensity of production, statutory status of sites and potential visual impact. </p>  <p>  The Department considers all applications for aquaculture licences in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act, the 1933 Foreshore Act and applicable national and EU legislation. There are several statutory timeframes set out in the legislation in respect of aquaculture licensing as the process involves consultation with a wide range of scientific and technical advisers as well as various Statutory Consultees. The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation. In addition, the legislation governing aquaculture licensing provides for an independent appeals mechanism. Foreshore licenses may also be appealed by way of Judicial Review.</p>  <p>  The Independent Aquaculture Licensing Review Group carried out a detailed examination of the existing aquaculture licensing process, undertook comprehensive stakeholder consultation and examined comparative national and international consent systems to determine best practice for managing a complex licensing process in a transparent, environmentally appropriate and legally robust manner. The recommendation to eliminate the backlog as a priority has been delivered in relation to shellfish and priority work is ongoing to address outstanding renewal applications in finfish aquaculture. </p>  <p>  I recently launched phase one of the new state of the art Aquaculture Information Management System (AQUAMIS). The online viewer was developed in collaboration with the Marine Institute and is the first step in digitising the aquaculture licensing application process. This online aquaculture viewer allows members of the public to freely access and view licensed aquaculture sites and mapping information through a public portal. Phase 2 of the project is currently being developed and will result in a one stop shop for the aquaculture licence application process, enhance the sharing of information and reduce the administrative burden.</p>  <p>  The Department is continually monitoring all of its services, including the licensing of aquaculture activities to ensure we provide an efficient service to all our customers while ensuring our environmental and legal obligations are being adhered to.</p></reply>

In this regard we also aim to facilitate small scale native tree planting up to 1 hectare. without the need for an afforestation licence, to encourage greater diversity.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, Project Woodland was established in February 2021 to ensure that the current licensing backlog is addressed and that a new impetus is brought to woodland creation in Ireland.  A national shared vision for the future of Ireland's trees and forests and a new Forestry Strategy are currently being developed. This new Forest Strategy will underpin a new Forestry Programme for the period 2023 - 2027. The Department has had extensive public consultation on the Strategy, which has brought forestry to the fore in terms of awareness, and  we are currently engaging further with stakeholders on the measures that will be considered for the new Programme. </p><p>There was an Open Call by the Department for Proposals for Woodland Support Projects to take place during 2021 and 2022, aimed at promoting the multi-functional benefits of forestry including the recreational, environmental, community and economic benefits.  Some 39 individual projects were selected for funding with a total budget of &euro;1.4 million<b></b>over the two years. One of the categories specifically targeted projects which support and highlight the environmental benefits of woodlands, including biodiversity.</p><p>We also work closely with Teagasc which  delivers a Forestry advisory and promotion programme each year to increase awareness levels and promote the multiple benefits associated with forestry.</p><p>COFORD has a Promotion and Afforestation Working Group (PAW), consisting of representatives from the various stakeholder groups, whose objective is to promote forestry including the implementation of measures to sustain and increase afforestation.</p><p>A refreshed Communications Strategy to promote all aspects of forestry, including increased afforestation and biodiversity is being finalised.  The Strategy objective is to be accessible, inclusive and collaborative and will work across a wide range of communication channels and tools to provide timely and accurate information which will promote a shared national vision for forestry in Ireland.</p></reply>

As at the end of May there were  almost 155,800 people in receipt of this payment, with expenditure on Disability Allowance for 2021 at &euro;1.8 billion.  An estimated &euro;4.8 billion was spent on illness, disability and caring schemes in 2021. The estimate for 2022 is &euro;4.9 billion.  </p><p>From the perspective of my Department, it is worth noting that a number of measures were introduced as part of Budget 2022 in relation to people with disabilities and their carers; these included:</p><p>- &euro;5 increase in maximum rate of all core weekly payments including people with disabilities and carers, with proportionate increases for qualified adults, with effect from January.</p><p>- &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependents aged 12 and over and &euro;2 for those up to age 12, in all core weekly payments.</p><p>- An increase in the general weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60 per week.</p><p>- An increase in the upper earnings disregard for Disability Allowance from &euro;350 to &euro;375.</p><p>- &euro;3 increase in the weekly Living Alone Allowance from &euro;19 to &euro;22 for people with disabilities who are living alone.</p><p>- &euro;5 increase in the Fuel Allowance from &euro;28 to &euro;33 per week.</p><p>- An increase to the Wage Subsidy scheme, which provides financial incentives to encourage private sector employers to employ people with disabilities.</p><p>- An increase in the Capital disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 from June.</p><p>- An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p><p>- Domiciliary Care Allowance will be paid for children who go into hospital for up to 6 months (was 3 months).  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will also continue to be paid in respect of children who go into hospital for 6 months. </p><p>My Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.  As part of this process my Department will host its annual pre-budget forum with the sector later this month.  Any proposed increases to payments, including to Disability Allowance, have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

The core objective of the public employment service is to help match jobseekers with employment opportunities as the economy recovers from COVID.  This strategy is working - with the unemployment rate now at pre-COVID levels - at 4.8%. </p>  <p>  In fact, we now have record numbers of people in the labour force - the highest the State has ever recorded with over 2.5 million people at work in quarter 1, 2022. </p>  <p>  This brings its own challenges, with a much tighter labour supply than anticipated.  I am aware that some employers are now facing difficulties recruiting staff.  This means that the priority of our public employment service is to work closely with employers so that they recruit from persons on the Live Register.  Currently there are some 186,821 people on the Live Register. </p>  <p>  Intreo Employment Services Officers and job coaches work with jobseekers to support them into jobs.  Dedicated Employer Relations Officers work with employers to help meet their recruitment needs.  Since the beginning of the year, 118 recruitment events have taken place, including 23 job fairs.  These include some specific events for the hospitality and construction sectors.  The Department has a dedicated team working under Government's Housing For All, Future Building Initiative to specifically recruit to construction jobs, from jobseekers in Ireland and abroad.  </p>  <p>  The Department also has a number of schemes to encourage employers to provide work experience and recruit directly from persons on the Live Register.  Schemes include the Work Placement Experience Programme and JobsPlus.   </p>  <p>  My Department also provides  an online jobs portal Jobsireland to enable employers to advertise their job vacancies and for jobseekers to apply for jobs.  I encourage all employers with vacancies and anyone looking for work to register on this website.  This is in addition to engaging with their local Intreo Office and availing of the full range of services they, along with contracted service providers, have available to assist both employers and jobseekers. </p></reply>

There are just under 2,900 participants on RSS.  </p>  <p>  In order to assist schemes to maintain services in the current tight labour market, Minister Humphreys and I recently announced a number of reforms to CE, T&uacute;s and RSS.  These will improve recruitment, remove the six year time limit on RSS for all participants while continuing the practice whereby CE placements can be extended until suitable replacements are available to fill vacancies.  These reforms will ensure that all RSS participants can now remain on the scheme until they reach state pension age and will improve access to employment schemes in general.   </p>  <p>  Feedback received to date in relation to all of the reforms has been positive and it is expected that these, in addition to changes introduced earlier this year, will have a positive impact at individual scheme level over the coming months.  </p>  <p>  In addition to these employment supports for long term unemployed, Government is supporting a range of initiatives to assist people back to work; as outlined under the Economic Recovery Plan and  national employment services strategy, &lsquo;Pathways to Work 2021-2025&rsquo;.  With the rate of unemployment now at just under 5% - these initiatives are working well.  </p>  <p>  Initiatives to support unemployed people back to work include an expanded JobsPlus recruitment subsidy scheme, an additional 50,000 education and training places,  and the new Work Placement Experience Programme.  My department has a team of Intreo Case Officers and Job Coaches nationwide providing a one-to-one career advice service and tailored employment supports to jobseekers.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, my department is fully committed to the future of employment support programmes and will continue to support and improve programmes for the benefit of long term unemployed participants and given the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.  I am also confident that the implementation of the national and local policy measures and responses outlined above will assist the full range of jobseekers find a pathway back to employment. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Contributions will be calculated as a percentage of the employee&rsquo;s gross income from employment; starting at 1.5% and rising every three years to a maximum of 6% by year 10 onwards.  The State will also contribute a top-up financial incentive at a rate of &euro;1 for every &euro;3 saved by the employee.</p>  <p>  A new Central Processing Authority will be set up to administer the system.  This will almost entirely eliminate any administrative burden on employers and will facilitate a &lsquo;pot-follows-member&rsquo; approach whereby workers will have one growing pension pot across employments and throughout their working life. </p>  <p>  Commercial registered providers of financial investment services, contracted following an open tender process, will provide a well-balanced and diversified default investment fund, plus three other fund options for employees who want to invest their money at different levels of risk.</p>  <p>  The implementation phase is well underway, with a project team in the Department of Social Protection progressing a range of elements in the overall plan.  This work includes the preparation of a general scheme of a bill to establish the automatic enrolment system on a statutory basis. </p>  <p>  To this end, I intend to bring a Memo to Government shortly seeking approval for the drafting of this legislation as a matter of priority, with a view to introducing the draft bill into the Oireachtas later this year.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.  </p>  <p>  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the primary income support through which the Department supports carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a payment to people on low incomes who are caring full-time for a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness, including mental illness.  The two principal conditions for receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided, and that the means test which applies is satisfied. </p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency, be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring. </p>  <p>  In responding to the carer organisations and the voices of family carers, significant changes were made to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means test as part of Budget 2022.  These were the first changes to the means test in 14 years. </p>  <p>  - The capital and savings disregard for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means assessment was increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which applies for Disability Allowance. </p>  <p>  - For carer&rsquo;s who work, the weekly income disregard was increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner. </p>  <p>  The changes came into effect on 2 June and many Carers who up to now did not qualify for a payment due to means will now be brought into the Carers Allowance system for the first time.</p>  <p>  Any additional changes to the Carers means test would have to be considered in an overall policy and Budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

These bodies have established track-records of helping governments develop fit-for-purpose employment services.  My Department engaged with these consultants, ensuring their proposals were appropriately configured for the Irish market, reflecting the unique strengths of the providers of employment services here while respecting the legal requirement for competitive procurement.  As part of their work the consultants engaged extensively with relevant stakeholders including those delivering the local employment service contracts. </p>  <p>  Prior to this engagement Indecon had undertaken extensive reviews of both the Local Employment Service and Job Club services.  The findings from the Indecon reviews in 2018 were factored into the design of the revised contracted public employment service model. </p>  <p>  One of the innovations of the Intreo Partners Local Area Employment Service is the minimising of the performance-based payment elements of the payment for services aimed at those farthest from the labour market.  This recognises the challenges these clients face is securing employment, giving employment services the space and time to address the obstacles to employment without penalising the providers financially.  This approach reflects both the input of external consultants and the Department's own extensive engagement with stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the Intreo Partners Local Area Employment Service, once rolled out across the State in the coming months, will significantly expand high quality employment service provision across the entire State for the first time.

The means assessment includes income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions and maintenance payments.  It also includes property owned other than the family home and capital such as savings, shares, and other investments.</p>  <p>  Following the improvements made in Budget 2022, income disregards for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are &euro;350 per week for a single person and &euro;750 per week for a couple.  These are the highest weekly income disregards within the social protection system.  After the disregards are applied, the vast majority of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance recipients are assessed with no means and receive the full rate of payment.</p>  <p>  In the case of Disability Allowance, a claimant can work and earn up to &euro;140 a week without their Disability Allowance payment being affected.  If a claimant earns more than &euro;140 a week, 50% of their earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;375 will not be taken into account in the Disability Allowance means test.</p>  <p>  If net rather than gross income was assessed for Carer's Allowance or Disability Allowance, it would mean that changes in tax rates or tax reliefs could change the claimant&rsquo;s rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and significantly increase the complexity of the means assessment and inevitably prolong the assessment process.</p>  <p>  People pay varying amounts of tax depending on their level of earnings and personal circumstances.   Allowing taxation as a deduction in the means test could mean that the social welfare system, in effect, refunds a person's tax liability.  Also, a person may see the benefit of a reduction in their tax bill, which would increase their net pay, eroded through an associated reduction in their social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  It would also have significant budgetary implications and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across schemes.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am pleased to report that claim processing is up to date, with processing targets met, or exceeded, on average for all the main scheme areas, including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (CA).</p><p>The target processing time for Carer's Allowance  is to process 75% of new claims within 11 weeks.  At the end of May 2022, 92% of applications were completed within the expected timeframe.  The average time taken to award a Carer's Allowance claim from January 2022 to May 2022 was 4 weeks.  The average time to award a new claim increased to 6 weeks during May 2022, mainly due to additional volumes of applications received during that period.  My officials are working to deal with these additional claims and to reduce waiting times.</p><p>Over the past 2 years, substantial improvements in processing performance was achieved across most schemes but especially in the carers and disability areas where claims are now consistently processed within 4 to 5 weeks, compared with 14 weeks in 2019.  </p><p>My Department is committed to providing a quality service, ensuring that claims are processed as quickly as possible.  Any backlogs arising are addressed without delay through a range of measures including system changes and the allocation of additional resources where needed.</p><p>I hope that clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is a targeted payment to people dependent on specified long-term social welfare payments.  The purpose of this payment is to assist those households most in need with their energy costs.  </p><p>The Government is acutely aware of recent price increases and their impact on households who are dependent on social welfare.  </p><p>For this reason, this Government did not await a further budget cycle to address these challenges but acted early.  Overall, the tax and spending measures we have introduced to ease the burden and provide support to those most in need have amounted to &euro;2.4 billion. </p><p>For recipients of Fuel Allowance, measures introduced by my Department included an increase of &euro;5 in the weekly rate of Fuel Allowance - which was paid with effect from the week of the Budget - and subsequent lump sum payments of &euro;125 and &euro;100 in March and May 2022 respectively.  Together, these measures mean that recipients of Fuel Allowance in 2021/22 received an increase of 55% compared to 2020/21.  Adding in the energy credit of &euro;200 paid to all households means that the value of energy-related payments to fuel allowance recipients increased by over 82% year-on-year, considerably in excess of the increase in energy prices.</p><p>Although energy costs abate during the summer months, I understand that households in receipt of fuel allowance will be concerned as to what provision might be made as we move towards the fuel season later this year.  The very significant measures already taken are proof that  this Government will act in a timely and decisive manner.  We will, however, have to take account, as always, of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is a legal requirement to ensure such services are procured through a competitive open procurement process.</p><p>Since the beginning of this process in 2019, my Department has engaged extensively with existing providers and representative bodies, including the Irish Local Development Network and trade unions.  In particular, my Department has gone to great efforts to ensure that existing providers are in a position to compete for the provision of these new employment services.</p><p>This involved a two phased approach.  First, running a limited competition in four geographic areas which did not already have local employment services and then, using the learnings from this process, to fine-tune the request for tenders in phase 2. </p><p>Taking these learnings on board, phase 2 included an increased number of lots, a greater emphasis on community linkages and, most importantly, a substantially increased minimum level of referrals for each lot.  These increased referrals mean that the annual income under the new model should exceed the existing cost base of LES and Job Clubs operating in each Lot.</p><p>Therefore, any existing provider who has successfully bid for a service should at least match and in many cases exceed their current income.  On this basis the need for redundancies in these circumstance is unclear.  However, subject to meeting the requirements of the contracted service in terms of staffing commitments and ratios of case officers to customers, the final staffing of the service is a matter for the successful bidder.</p><p>The preferred bidders for the new Intreo Partners Local Area Employment Services have just been notified.  The next step is the finalising of contracts and the commencement of referrals to the new service.  Pending this, my Department has extended the contracts of most LES and Job Clubs until the end of August.  However, a small number of providers have declined the extension offer, which is at their discretion and they will have communicated their decision and rationale to their staff.</p><p>In circumstances where existing providers chose not to bid for the new services or were unsuccessful then I would expect that, as a first option, providers should look to redeploy any staff affected to other functions within their organisations.  However, where this is not possible, and if these employers are unable to finance redundancy payments, then my Department's Redundancy and Insolvency service will, in accordance with relevant legislation, be able to make provision for statutory redundancy payments for any affected staff.</p></reply>

As such the &lsquo;Cost of Disability&rsquo; is significantly wider than the income support system.  </p><p>Indecon also found that there is not a single typical &lsquo;cost of disability&rsquo;; rather there is a spectrum from low additional costs to extremely high extra costs of disability, depending on the individual circumstances of the person concerned. </p><p>As the findings of the research have implications for many areas of public policy, a whole-of-Government perspective is needed.  As such the Government has referred the report on the Cost of Disability to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, which Is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability and is comprised of relevant departments, agencies, the Disability Stakeholder Group (DSG6) and people with disabilities.  </p><p>This Group has oversight of monitoring the key frameworks for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities and it is in this regard that the Government saw it fitting that this group would be the appropriate monitoring vehicle.  It will consider and monitor actions required by the various Government Departments on foot of this report on a bi-annual basis.  </p><p>From the perspective of my Department, it is worth noting that a number of measures were introduced as part of Budget 2022 in relation to people with disabilities and their carers, which reflect some of the findings of the report.  These included a combination of core weekly payment rate increases, increases in earnings disregards as well as supports for private sector employers.</p><p>Under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion (2020-2025) and Pathways to Work (2021-2025) strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments to simplify the system.

In this context my Department is currently carrying out a review of its Reasonable Accommodation Fund.  </p><p>The public consultation phase of this review has been completed and officials are reviewing the submissions made, with a report to be finalised in Q3.

Currently, there are some 27,000 participants engaged on the three main schemes: Community Employment, T&uacute;s and the Rural Social Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Community Employment is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis.  </p>  <p>  T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative that provides short-term, quality work opportunities in community and voluntary sectors for those who are unemployed for more than a year. </p>  <p>  The RSS is an income support initiative that provides part-time employment opportunities in community and voluntary organisations for farmers or fishermen who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are underemployed in their primary occupation. </p>  <p>  Last year Minister Humphreys and I introduced the Employment Support Services Operation Forum where we, along with department officials, meet representatives from CE, Job Initiative, RSS and T&uacute;s schemes.  This Forum now meets three to four times a year and provides a valuable opportunity to discuss operational issues arising on the schemes that are impacting on service delivery in the communities.  Both Minster Humphreys and I find the meetings to be extremely informative and a very worthwhile opportunity for constructive exchanges of views and ideas with schemes.</p>  <p>  Departmental staff, through the local CE community development officers, work closely with schemes on all aspects of their operation while department officials meet centrally with various groups and organisations such as the Drugs Advisory Group and the Irish Local Development Network.</p>  <p>  Minister Humphreys and I also interact regularly with schemes at ground level by visiting and engaging with schemes throughout the country.  These schemes provide valuable services within communities and the range of work undertaken by participants ranges from the delivery of meals on wheels, the provision of childcare, caretaking and environmental works and other community and voluntary services.  I have been hugely impressed by the range and value of the work undertaken on these schemes, many of which I have had the opportunity to visit and witness at first hand.   </p>  <p>  In order to further assist schemes maintain services in the current tight labour market, Minister Humphreys informed Government at the end of June of additional measures we are now introducing to CE, T&uacute;s and RSS.  These will improve recruitment, remove the six year time limit on RSS for all participants while continuing the practice whereby placements can be extended until suitable replacements are available to fill vacancies.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;273 million this year on HHB for over 492,000 customers.  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p><p>Any decision to enhance or increase the electricity and gas aspect of the package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in that overall budgetary context. </p><p>The Government is acutely aware of recent price increases and their impact on households who are dependent on social welfare.  For this reason, this Government did not await a further budget cycle to address these challenges but acted early.  Overall, the tax and spending measures we have introduced to ease the burden and provide support to those most in need have amounted to &euro;2.4 billion.<b></b></p><p>All of these measures will be kept under review, together with trends in prices, to inform preparations for the budget later this year.</p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

The rates of payment for the 2022 scheme year are &euro;260 for children aged between 4 and 11 years and &euro;385 for children aged 12 and over.</p>  <p>  The allowance is payable for eligible children between the ages of 4 and 17 in respect of whom a qualified child increase is in payment.

This year, the income limits for one parent families were increased to bring them in line with the income limits for two parent families, widening the eligibility for that group of customers.

Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.  </p>  <p>  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the primary income support through which the Department supports carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a payment to people on low incomes who are caring full-time for a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness, including mental illness.  The two principal conditions for receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided, and that the means test which applies is satisfied.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department provides a number of non-means tested payments to carers.</p>  <p>  The Carers Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions.  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care.  It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). </p>  <p>  The Carer's Support Grant is automatically paid to people in receipt of Carer's Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care allowance in June of each year.  Other carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment may also be eligible for the Grant.  The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs.  The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers.  As part of Budget Measures 2021 the rate of the grant was increased by &euro;150.  The new rate of &euro;1,850 came into effect from June 2021.  This is the highest rate of the grant since its introduction. </p>  <p>  Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  The Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is &euro;309.50 per month.  There is no restriction on the number of children for whom a person may claim Domiciliary Care Allowance. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The two main national strategies in this area are the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. </p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (D/CEDIY) is the lead Department with regards to both of these strategies.</p>  <p>  There are a number of other strategies that provide a framework for cross-departmental working and the development of services for people with disabilities.  These include the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work.  My department continues to deliver on its commitments under these strategies; for example in 2022 there has been progress as follows:</p>  <p>  - A &euro;25 increase to the upper weekly earnings disregards for both the Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension, from &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week.</p>  <p>  - An increase to the Wage Subsidy Scheme which is now equivalent to 60% of the National Minimum Wage.

This is a key action under Pathways to Work and will see the Intreo service engaging actively and at the earliest opportunity to support disabled people to enter or return to employment.  This approach is to be gradually rolled out nationally, and will also be expanded to other age groups over time.  </p>  <p>  - Under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 and Pathways to Work 2021-2025 strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments to simplify the system.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate for 2019 averaged approximately 12.5 percent.  However, after the onset of the pandemic, the CSO&rsquo;s &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; monthly youth unemployment rate &ndash; which included all those in receipt of the PUP &ndash; increased dramatically, peaking at almost 70 percent in May 2020.</p>  <p>  Following the reopening of the economy most young people closed their PUP claims and returned to work, resulting in a strong decline in youth unemployment.  As of June 2022, the youth unemployment rate stood at 5.4 percent. </p>  <p>  While it is welcome that the youth unemployment rate has declined so rapidly, it is critical to continue to minimise potential scarring effects amongst young people who permanently lost their jobs during the pandemic, and to support young people who face difficulties or higher barriers to entry to the labour market.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Government&rsquo;s employment services strategy, includes a number of measures to support disadvantaged young people.  These include expanding the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy scheme and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years; and ring-fencing places for eligible young people on a range of employment support schemes such as the Work Placement Experience Programme, Community Employment and T&uacute;s.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training and upskilling opportunities.  As committed in Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are providing an additional 50,000 further education and training places to help more people to have the opportunity to upskill for employment.  These training and upskilling opportunities are likely to be of particular relevance to young people seeking to enter the labour market for the first time.</p></reply>

The group met on four occasions in 2021 and has met twice this year to date.  The group has focused on two pieces of work to date.  The first is a high-level mapping exercise of programmes, services and supports across Government that address food poverty and provide supports in this area.  Data gathering is complete, and a report expected to be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The second piece of work is a research project to analyse the prevalence of food poverty in two selected case study areas: one urban and one rural.  Broadly speaking, there are a range of known drivers of food poverty including: affordability; accessibility; sufficiency; and quality.  However, this research aims to identify the drivers of food poverty in each case study area and examine the range of service providers and actors relating to food poverty in each area.  It should also identify any gaps and overlaps in service provision.  The findings from this research should further inform the delivery of commitment 61 of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The aim of the CE and T&uacute;s programmes are  to enhance the employability of disadvantaged and  long term unemployed people by providing work experience and training opportunities within their communities. </p><p>In addition, RSS is an income support initiative providing part-time employment opportunities for farmers or fishermen in receipt of certain social welfare payments, and underemployed in their primary occupation, within their local area in community and voluntary organisations. </p><p>In order to further assist all three schemes in the current tight labour market and as COVID emergency supports are phased out, Minister Humphreys and I recently announced a number of  measures to CE, T&uacute;s and RSS.  These will improve recruitment, remove the six year time limit on RSS for all participants, while continuing the practice whereby placements can be extended until suitable replacements are available to fill vacancies.  These reforms will ensure that schemes can maintain services to local communities, all RSS participants can remain on the scheme until they reach State pension age and will improve access to schemes.</p><p>Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government and in the Rural Development Policy 2021-2025 to review the means assessment disregards for the Farm Assist.  As part of this review process, it was recommended to provide for an extensive expansion to the list of Agri-Environmental schemes which qualifies towards income disregards.  These measures have now been implemented from June 2022.  While it is not possible to quantify the number of people who may benefit from these changes, it is hoped that they will have an added benefit of increasing the number of people who could potentially apply for the RSS scheme, through being in receipt of Farm Assist.</p><p>It will take some time to measure the impact of this change and the increased number of potential RSS participants.  It should be noted that RSS Implementing Bodies (IBs) are encouraged by the Department to promote and publicise the RSS, to increase public awareness of the scheme and encourage take-up and participation in their area.  I would strongly encourage persons interested in participating on the scheme to contact their local IB to take up these available places.  <b></b></p><p>The Department is fully committed to the future of employment support programmes and will continue to support and improve them for the benefit of the supervisors, team leaders and participants, given the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares, and other investments. </p>  <p>  The assessment of capital reflects an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital, or to realise the value of the property, to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means-tested welfare payment.</p>  <p>  While savings are assessed in the means test, most social protection schemes have a general capital disregard meaning the full amount of the capital is not assessed.</p>  <p>  The standard formula for assessing the value of capital for most social welfare payments is as follows: the first &euro;20,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, the capital disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was increased to &euro;50,000, bringing it into line with the capital disregard for Disability Allowance.  The new formula is as follows: the first &euro;50,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.</p>  <p>  The capital assessment formula is not designed to reflect interest or annuity rates available to investors and no account is taken of interest or dividend payments received in the means assessment. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the means assessment formula for social assistance schemes would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

A fast-track approach in processing these supports includes a simplified decision-making process and quick processing of PPSNs to allow access to public services and income supports.   </p>  <p>  To allow payments to be made as quickly as possible, all applications for income support were initially set up to be paid in cash at post offices.  Cash payments at post offices are one of the two main payment method options provided by my Department.  People can also be paid directly into their account in either a bank, in An Post or in a credit union.  The Department&rsquo;s policy is, where possible, to offer people the choice of being paid in cash at the post office or directly into an account in a financial institution of their choosing.</p>  <p>  Given the temporary and transient nature of accommodation for many of the people fleeing the war in Ukraine, it has proven to be more practical for many Temporary Protection recipients to be paid directly into an account by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT).</p>  <p>  My Department is working alongside other relevant Government Departments and Bodies, as well as with An Post and the Banking Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI), in order to assist Ukrainians in obtaining payments and setting up accounts in financial institutions.  </p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for my Department to give preferential treatment to one financial institution over another.  By restricting payments to accounts in An Post, my Department would be in breach of EU Regulation 260/2012 (the &lsquo;SEPA&rsquo; Regulation).  </p>  <p>  This regulation forbids restricting payments to a specific financial institution within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).  Therefore, it is not possible to favour An Post over any other financial institution licenced by the Central Bank of Ireland nor indeed to favour any Irish institution over one in another European Union member state or within the wider SEPA zone.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Central Bank is the competent authority to ensure compliance with Regulation 260/2012.  This regulation came into effect in Ireland in 2014.  As the competent authority, the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to impose penalties on any Government Department for non-compliance with the Regulation. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to provide financial support to those people arriving from Ukraine, under the EU&rsquo;s Temporary Protection Directive and in compliance with the SEPA Regulation.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Energy costs are one of the prime factors in the increase in business costs to which the deputy refers, and we have already implemented several measures to help ease the impact on enterprises of energy price increases including reductions in VAT and excise on some fuels, as well as a temporary grant scheme to hauliers in the supply chain.</p><p>Minister Donohoe recently announced the extension of the 9% Value Added Tax (VAT) rate for the tourism and hospitality industry for a further six months; a measure for which &euro;250 million is the estimated cost to the exchequer.</p><p>Government Departments have been consulting with stakeholders on specific measures that could be considered to ameliorate the short to medium term challenges to energy security. The Energy Supply Emergency Group is an inter-departmental and inter-agency group with responsibility for informing the Government response to the impact of rising energy costs on business, security of energy supply more generally, and a longer-term reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported oil and gas.  </p><p>Under the aegis of this Group, my Department has established the Business Energy Users Sub-Group to lead on consultations with business and industry to learn about the specific impacts on Irish businesses, and to hear their concerns and perspectives on the appropriate and most effective tools for policy action. The work of this sub-group, as part of the wider Energy Supply Emergency Group has informed the National Energy Security Framework which was launched by the Government on 13th April 2022.</p><p>Furthermore, my Department is discussing competitiveness and price inflation for enterprises with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  To deliver price competitiveness over the medium-term, Government is determined to deliver a diversified energy system, with significant support for energy efficiency and renewables, alongside independent regulation that protects consumers and delivers efficient, competitive energy retail and wholesale markets.</p><p>At present, a range of supports are available to households and businesses ranging from practical advice to financial supports. These can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/Energy-supports/Energy-supports-for-business.html</i>.</p><p>Practical advice includes the Climate Toolkit 4 Business, launched late last year by my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. This allows SMEs to input simple information to get an estimate of their carbon footprint and a personalised action plan to reduce it.</p><p>From the Local Enterprise Offices, the Green for Micro initiative offers mentoring to micro-enterprises looking to become greener. Additionally, the Lean for Micro scheme works with clients of the Local Enterprise Offices to help build resilience.</p><p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides direct grants such as the support scheme for renewable heat, project assistance grants, the EXEED grant scheme, tax incentives available through the Accelerated Capital Allowance, and funding for energy audits. Further training is available via the SEAI&rsquo;s Energy Academy.</p><p>Finally, there are loans available for businesses absorbing the numerous economic shocks of recent years. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland offers the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme, offering loans from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, and the Credit Guarantee Scheme for businesses responding to the impact of COVID-19. These loan facilities may also be helpful to businesses struggling with increased energy costs.  Microenterprises can also avail of loans of up to &euro;25k from Microfinance Ireland which they may not be able to avail of from commercial lenders.</p></reply>

Given that Ireland is a price taker on international energy markets, the Government has no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of these prices. However, Government has put in place a suite of targeted measures aimed at reducing the burden of these cost pressures, both for businesses and households. Given the volatility of fuel prices, it is important that measures are sustainable and targeted.</p><p>The Government has implemented several measures to help ease the impact on enterprises of energy price increases including:</p><p>- a reduction in the rate of VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% until the 31<sup>st</sup>of October; </p><p>- a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel, and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil;</p><p>A range of cross-sectoral supports and grants to mitigate the effects of rising energy costs on households and businesses are available.</p><p>Businesses can view the supports on my Department&rsquo;s website at enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/Energy-supports/Energy-supports-for-business.html</p><p>Loans are available for businesses absorbing the numerous economic shocks of recent years. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland offers the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme, offering loans from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, and the Credit Guarantee Scheme for businesses responding to the impact of COVID-19. These loan facilities may also be helpful to businesses struggling with increased energy costs.</p><p>Microenterprises can also avail of loans of up to &euro;25k from Microfinance Ireland which they may not be able to avail of from commercial lenders.</p><p>Separately, my Department is encouraging and supporting firms to make investments in increased energy efficiency and a reduced carbon footprint, through a number of measures available through SEAI, including direct grants such as the support scheme for renewable heat, project assistance grants, the EXEED grant scheme, tax incentives available through the Accelerated Capital Allowance, and funding for energy audits. As an energy intensive sector, engaging with these supports is vital for retail for now and for the future. </p><p>Earlier this year, I established a Working Group on the Green Transition under the Retail Forum to work with the sector to support its transition to become a sustainable sector. As a first step, I would encourage all retailers to complete the Climatetoolkit4business to assess their carbon emissions and access supports to reduce their carbon footprint. The toolkit is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>Through our Local Enterprise Offices the Green for Micro initiative offers mentoring to micro-enterprises looking to become greener. It offers green transition advice and technical support to a wide range of micro-enterprises with 10 or fewer employees, including those operating in the retail sector. This support is free of charge for eligible enterprises and represents the potential for increased efficiencies within companies that adopt these principles.</p><p>Additionally, the main purpose of this year&rsquo;s budget will be to address the rising cost of living in the country. Budget 2023 will provide an overall package of &euro;6.7 billion, representing additional public spending of &euro;5.65 billion and taxation measures amounting to &euro;1.05 billion (an increase of &euro;2.2 billion against what was originally budgeted). </p><p>I will forward a copy of this correspondence to the Department of Finance also in relation to items raised which fall under the responsibility of that Department.</p></reply>

Over the past 5 years, the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme has enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations.   There are now 94 IDA supported companies in Galway City and County, employing a total of 22,801 people. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland actively promotes available buildings and land in IDA Business Parks and high-quality buildings in private ownership through its network of overseas offices.  In Galway, IDA has invested significantly in the provision of world-class property solutions. I have been advised that IDA Ireland do not currently have plans to purchase additional lands while the Agency is marketing the available lands to potential investors.</p>  <p>  Ballinasloe is marketed as part of the West Region.  This provides scale and scope, which gives confidence to the investor that they will be able to establish themselves outside of a main city area and manage to secure talent and services to make their business work. IDA markets the West Region to the Life Sciences, Technology and Global Business Services sectors.</p>  <p>  IDA continues to market the available lands (c.21.94 acres) on the IDA business and technology park in Ballinasloe to potential investors, including the advanced planning permission for an Advanced Technology Unit on these lands. IDA and Ballinasloe Area Community Development recently completed a joint venture to secure planning for an Advance Technology Unit, which IDA Ireland is marketing as a potential flexible property solution for the region.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-14a.467.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400072#WRJ04700"><p>From next year the Government is introducing a new permanent public holiday in celebration of Imbolc/St. Brigid&rsquo;s day. This will be the first Monday in every February, except where St. Brigid&rsquo;s day, the 1st day of February, happens to fall on a Friday, in which case that Friday 1st February will be a public holiday. The Government wants to ensure that the public holiday provides for a long weekend. The first St. Brigid&rsquo;s day public holiday will be Monday 6th February 2023.</p><p>An additional public holiday may impact in terms of cost to the Exchequer broadly in two ways. First, it might result in lower tax receipts due to any associated reduction in economic activity. Second, there would be a notional cost in terms of lost labour hours. </p><p>Due to lack of data, it is not possible to generate a historical estimate for the impact of a one-off public holiday using Irish data. Previous analysis by the UK Office for National Statistics estimated the economic impact of an additional one-off public holiday would reduce annual gross national income by between 0.3% and 0.4%. Assuming that this reduction in economic activity is passed through in terms of reduced tax revenue on a pro rate basis &ndash; which may not be the case &ndash; this would indicate a cost to the Exchequer of between &euro;220 million and &euro;300 million. This estimate is based on forecast tax revenue for 2022 of &euro;75.8 billion, from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s spring economic forecasts as set out in the <i>Stability Programme Updae.</i></p><p>The second cost to the Exchequer would be in terms of lost work hours resulting from the public holiday. While, in practice, a sizeable portion of the public service will continue to work on a public holiday, there will be additional entitlements to time off in lieu. The Revised Estimates for Public Services 2022 estimates an Exchequer pay bill of &euro;21.9 billion for 2022, or just over &euro;60 million per day &ndash; which provides an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of a public holiday.  It is emphasised that these costs are notional in the main and will not lead to additional expenditure for the Exchequer. A large part of the public service is salaried, and so their pay and subsequently the cost to the Exchequer will be the same irrespective of a public holiday. These numbers only provide an indicative estimate of the potential economic cost of an additional public holiday to the Exchequer and do not capture positive aspects including benefits of leisure from an additional day off for many, as well as any further community and societal benefits.</p></reply>

Also included are Subheads A15, A17 and B8 which are administered through Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>The underspends by the aforementioned Agencies of my Department were mainly in the area of capital expenditure. In this regard my Department was allocated significant additional non-core capital funding in 2021 to assist it and the Agencies concerned in the battle against Covid-19. One of the primary factors giving rise to the underspend in 2021 was the progress made in reopening the economy, which meant that less of the additional non-core funding was required to be expended by the Agencies concerned.</p><p>Insofar as 2022 is concerned, whilst expenditure of a number of the Department&rsquo;s Agencies is behind profile as at the end of May, this is not necessarily an indicator of an underspend at year-end. The timing of drawdowns of capital monies can vary for many reasons resulting in an under or overspend against profile at a particular point in time. </p></reply>

It also maintains a focus on attracting the next generation of leading MNCs to locate in Ireland, further driving sustainable growth and maximising the impact of FDI in Ireland to 2024 and beyond.</p>  <p>  Regional development is at the centre of the IDA&rsquo;s new strategy. IDA is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development.</p>  <p>  During 2021, 249 investments were won, 104 of these were new name investments. Growth in Regions was particularly buoyant with over half of the 249 investments won going to regional locations.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland's results for 2021 showed that total employment in IDA client companies in Ireland now stands at 275,384, up 16,826 on 2020, the highest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) employment level ever. Employment growth was recorded in every region of the country, with the North-East Region showing 5% growth on the previous year.  FDI performance has been particularly strong within the Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies, Medical Technologies, Technology, International Financial Services and Life Sciences sectors. There are 103 IDA client companies in the Mid-East Region, employing 18,894. 35 of these companies are in County Louth, directly employing over 4,588 people.   </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland recently announced that it has acquired two landbanks in Co Louth.  The land acquisitions, with a combined total of 149 acres, situated at the townland of Killally, in Dundalk and Mell in Drogheda form part of IDA&rsquo;s long term strategic plans to position Louth and the wider North-East region to compete for FDI investment. </p>  <p>  Both sets of lands have been added to the IDA marketing database. A review is underway with respect to further servicing considerations and best positioning of the landbanks to potential FDI investment opportunities. With respect to lands in Drogheda, a concept review for an Advanced Building Solution is progressing.  </p>  <p>  The timely provision of appropriate, cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of MNCs remains essential to winning Foreign Direct Investment. IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme ensures the continued supply of land, buildings and infrastructure in regional locations to meet the needs of current and prospective clients.  A robust property and infrastructure ecosystem can be the key differentiator in winning FDI projects.  IDA Ireland is pleased to have acquired these two landbanks enhancing the offering in the North-East.  Over the last five years, IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations. IDA will continue to work with commercial property developers and Local Authorities to market other property solutions across all regions where they exist.</p></reply>

There is potential for the Dublin-Belfast Economic Corridor to develop a unique international brand as a cross-border region with a particularly strong offering for Foreign Direct Investment seeking to gain access to the European Single Market.</p>  <p>  The M1 Dublin-Belfast Corridor falls within the remit of this initiative and aims to connect the two largest cities on the island, Dublin and Belfast. This enhanced connectivity will be appealing to both indigenous and non-indigenous enterprises, allowing the region to further add to its reputation as a thriving hub of economic activity.</p>  <p>  The Government is supportive of this initiative and has set out in the National Planning Framework how it wants to build on the strengths of the Dublin-Belfast Economic Corridor to capitalise on the clear economic potential of the region. That will involve effectively planning and developing new growth areas, investing in infrastructure and connectivity, and also protecting distinctive landscapes, green spaces and rural activities along the corridor.</p>  <p>  Local stakeholders within the region, including Local Authorities, the enterprise agencies, Local Enterprise Offices, Regional Skills Forum and the business community meet through the Steering Committee for the North-East Regional Enterprise Plan to 2024 . The Committee is chaired by Richard Hanlon of Aon. I will ask my officials to suggest an update on progress on the M1 Dublin-Belfast corridor be included as an agenda item for this Committee.</p>  <p>  In addition, IDA Ireland is continuing to market the region to potential investors leveraging infrastructure projects such as the M1 Dublin-Belfast Corridor, alongside the region's rich talent pool and strong track record for industry.  I am confident that through the collaborative efforts from the local stakeholders and enterprise agencies the region will remain competitive as a business and investment location.</p></reply>

It also sets out the national and international policy context for mineral exploration and mining, identifying the role minerals will play in helping Ireland meet its international goals and commitments, including the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, Raw Materials Initiative and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. </p><p>Bauxite is among a number of minerals and metals used in the manufacture of batteries. The final draft of the new EU Batteries Regulation which has been under negotiation since April, aims to ensure that batteries placed on the EU market should become sustainable, high-performing and safe throughout their life cycle. This includes producing batteries with the lowest possible environmental impact, using materials obtained in full respect of human rights as well as social and ecological standards, and ensuring they are long-lasting and safe, and aiming for them at end of life to be repurposed, remanufactured or recycled, feeding valuable materials back into the economy. Supply chain aspects are also addressed by requiring new due diligence policies for certain batteries placed on the single market, and empowering EU Commission review in respect of that obligation so as to address social and environmental risks inherent in the extraction, processing and trading of certain raw materials for battery manufacturing purposes.</p><p>Advocacy by certain international human rights organisations over the past number of years has highlighted the social and environmental impacts including human rights abuses, of bauxite mining in Guinea, as well as the scope for and extent of responsible sourcing of aluminium by, for example, car manufacturers.  More recently, a coalition including Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International, has called on the EU to ensure the proposed EU Regulation would require responsible sourcing by importers and manufacturers of materials including bauxite used in batteries.</p><p>Materials management and the sustainable and responsible sourcing and use of critical raw materials are central to our vision for minerals and mining in Ireland and are key components of the circular economy transition. Bauxite is included on the 2020 List of Critical Raw Materials accompanying the European Commission's Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials: &lsquo;Critical Raw Materials Resilience: Charting a Path towards greater Security and Sustainability', which also considered the use of critical raw materials for strategic technologies and sectors from the 2030 and 2050 perspectives. The Action Plan proposes actions to reduce Europe's dependency on third countries, diversifying supply from both primary and secondary sources and improving resource efficiency and circularity while promoting responsible global sourcing.  In this regard, the Environmental Protection Agency's 2020 'Al Source' research paper examined<font color="#1F497D"> </font>the potential to recover other valuable minerals from bauxite residues such as those which are produced at Aughinish.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to developing a longer-term plan to harness the estimated potential of at least 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters.  The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 provides legislation for an entirely new marine planning system, to balance harnessing our offshore wind potential while protecting our rich and unique marine environment. Applications from Relevant Projects for Maritime Area Consents under the new marine planning regime are now being assessed with the first Maritime Area Consents expected to be issued later this year. This marks an important step towards our 2030 targets.</p>  <p>  Concurrently, my Department is designing a pathway, based on consultation feedback, for a second batch of projects to progress through the new consenting system when the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority is established in early 2023.</p>  <p>  Work on a revised Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan is underway. This plan will provide an evidence base for the identification of the most suitable areas for sustainable offshore renewable energy development and set a pathway for the development of offshore renewables beyond 2030.</p>  <p>  A cross-Departmental Offshore Wind Delivery Taskforce has been established to accelerate and drive delivery and capture wider and longer term economic and business opportunities associated with the development of offshore renewables in Ireland. This includes identifying supporting infrastructure development and supply chain opportunities as the industry is developed. </p>  <p>  Offshore renewable energy is vital to Ireland&rsquo;s green energy transition, reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels, lowering our greenhouse gas emissions, and strengthening our security of supply.</p></reply>

The National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme introduces a new, highly customer centric, way to undertake home upgrades. SEAI registered One-Stop-Shops will provide an end-to-end service for homeowners. This includes surveying; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors; and quality assurance.  </p><p>The Scheme offers unprecedented grant levels, increased from circa 30% to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump. </p><p>Following Government approval, the SEAI registration portal opened for companies to apply to be a One-Stop-Shop (OSS), building on the preparatory work already undertaken. SEAI are focused on engaging organisations capable of professionally managing all aspects of a OSS service. Therefore, the registration process, for this new service, must be robust.</p><p>The SEAI advise that there are a number of clearly defined minimum eligibility criteria in order to apply to become an OSS. The applicant must be able to demonstrate that they can meet the criteria under the key areas as outlined below: </p><p>- Financial Probity and Business Standing </p><p>- Organisational Capability and Technical Competence </p><p>- Governance and Legal Requirements </p><p>- Business Systems and IT Capability </p><p>- Market Engagement </p><p>- Skilled Workforce (direct or partnerships) </p><p>- Quality Assurance </p><p>- Obligated Party if relevant </p><p>- Commitment as a partner and key stakeholder in national retrofit</p><p>Once the OSS applicant meets the eligibility criteria, they are then required to submit a strategic plan to SEAI for assessment and agreement and enter into an OSS appointment agreement with SEAI. </p><p>In accordance with each OSS quality management system, each OSS must ensure they have sufficient competent resources in place, either directly employed or subcontracted via each OSS subcontractor framework, to satisfy all the home energy upgrade measures required. The individual competency requirements for each specific measure are described in the Domestic Technical Standards and Specifications. Each OSS must ensure, through their competency and onboarding frameworks, internal auditing process and training, that all contractors adhere to these technical requirements. Each OSS is responsible for contracting their own subcontractors via their own appointment criteria.</p><p>The SEAI advise that nine OSSs have now been registered, outlined in Table below, and the SEAI is actively working with applicant organisations to support them through this registration process. </p><p>As set out in the eligibility criteria to register as a OSS, each must ensure they have sufficient competent resources in place. This means the proportion of staff directly employed by the OSSs to the level of support through frameworks of subcontractors and independent consultants varies considerably across the nine registered depending on their respective business models. </p><p>SEAI has indicated that the OSSs have received over 18,000 initial expressions of interest by phone and online, showing the interest in the new offering.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Registered One Stop Shop</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SS Airtricity</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kore Retrofit</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Electric Ireland Superhomes</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>House2Home Retrofit </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Retrofit Energy Ireland Limited</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EnviroBead</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Integrate Energy Upgrades</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bayview Contracts</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EnerGlaze &amp;amp; Bord Gais Energy</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In addition, my Department is engaging with national stakeholders to develop a policy paper on legislation to define the future mandate, functions and powers of the NCSC. It is intended that this policy paper will be agreed by end 2022 leading to the drafting of Heads of a Bill in 2023.In line with the recommendation from the Capacity Review and building on the Post Incident Review of the NCSC's response to the HSE incident, the NCSC has developed a new National Cyber Emergency Plan. This plan replaces the previous Critical National Incident Response Plan and sets out a whole of Government response process to serious national cyber incidents. The plan includes categorisation criteria for incidents and sets out the roles and responsibilities for various stakeholders, as well as an escalation process for various incident types. This Plan has been shared with all relevant stakeholders and will be subject to ongoing review and update. </p><p>The NCSC has been operating at a heightened state of preparedness in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The NCSC continues to work closely with the Defence Forces and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is in frequent contact with operators of critical infrastructure and services to monitor for possible malicious cyber activity. In addition, the NCSC is in ongoing contact with its counterparts in the EU, the UK, the US and other countries to share information and to monitor possible threats. The NCSC has issued a number of guidance and support documents recently, including a detailed Advisory Note and a &lsquo;Cyber Vitals&rsquo; check list. This Advisory detailed a cyber risk assessment and appropriate advice regarding the ongoing situation in Ukraine. These documents are publicly available on the NCSC website ncsc.gov.ie/news/. </p></reply>

I propose to answer 219 and 220 together. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) under a contract to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in almost 560,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with some 679 schools.</p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 1 July 2022, over 312,800 premises are design completed and over 70,700 premises can order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 23 counties. NBI has further advised that over 63,600 premises are passed with a high speed fibre broadband service across 23 counties and available for immediate connection. Construction is complete or underway across 26 counties demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with projections with some areas exceeding expectations. In County Mayo there are 36,919 premises in the Intervention Area and NBI has advised that, as of the end of June, some 3,322 premises are passed and available for immediate connection.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: www.nbi.ie/reps</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 644 BCP sites have been installed by NBI, as of 1 July 2022, and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Mayo 15 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed by NBI to date.  Further details can be found at nbi.ie/broadband-connection-points/.</p>  <p>  In County Mayo 41 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</p></reply>

My Department is engaging with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland and the European Investment Bank in relation to the development of a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme.    The residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme is part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan and will be co-funded by the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility and Exchequer funding. The scheme is still under development and market engagement is on-going. The Invitation for Pre-Qualification stage to identify interested On-Lenders has now concluded. This is an important milestone in the development of the scheme. The Invitation for Allocation stage, planned for Q3 2022, will determine how much of the guaranteed loan portfolio will be allocated to each On-Lender. The Invitation for Allocation will set out the interest rate pricing approach under the scheme. The aim is to make the loans under the guarantee available in Q4 2022.</p>  <p>  The loan guarantee will provide risk protection to retail credit institutions participating in the scheme. This will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates to private homeowners and non-corporate landlords and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to consumers. This approach will signal to the banking sector, new sustainable business opportunities associated with retrofit and the transition to a low carbon economy as well as increasing the volume of retrofit activity within the State.</p></reply>

There are currently just over 9,600 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. The number of homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme waiting list by county at the end of June 2022 is set out in the table below. </p><p>COVID-19 related restrictions in 2020 and 2021 negatively impacted wait times under the Energy Poverty Schemes. COVID cases are continuing to impact works on the schemes, both on the Contractors&rsquo; and Customers&rsquo; side.  </p><p>It is important to note that the SEAI received over 5,000 applications for the Warmer Homes Scheme to the end of June this year, compared with 2,874 for the whole of 2021.  The increased publicity around the launch of the new SEAI National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme and revisions to the Warmer Homes Scheme, together with increased energy costs, are driving demand for this critical Scheme.</p><p>In addition, the deeper measures being provided under the Warmer Homes Scheme result in upgrades taking longer to complete.  In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased to &euro;17,620 reflecting the significant works being carried out.</p><p>SEAI data indicates that, for homes completed in 2022, the average cycle time from application to completion was 28 months for the Warmer Homes Scheme and the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme. That average wait time is a function of the level of disruption caused byCOVID-19.The Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme is confined to specific areas of Dublin. </p><p>Delivering free energy upgrades to low-income households and reducing the waiting times on the Warmer Homes Scheme waiting list is a top priority for my Department and SEAI. In order to reduce this timeline to completion and target a monthly average of 400 completions this year, the following actions have already been taken:</p><p>- The budget, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;</p><p>- SEAI has been allocated additional staff for the Warmer Homes Scheme;</p><p>- SEAI is working to increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management.</p><p>Delivery under the Warmer Homes Scheme remains a top priority for the Minister and SEAI.</p><p>Other SEAI schemes require homeowners to procure their own contractor or One Stop Shops secure approval from SEAI and draw down a grant once the works are completed.  </p><p>For Better Energy Homes and Solar PV Schemes completion times are within the control of the homeowner. However, works must be completed within an 8-month period, starting from the date of grant approval. Under the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, homeowners will engage a registered One Stop Shop to manage the grant application process and oversee delivery of the retrofit on their behalf. Works must be completed under this scheme within 12 months.  <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>No. of Homes</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>114</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>95</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>193</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>1,014</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>360</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>2,697</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>535</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>299</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>355</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>130</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>148</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>348</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>70</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>187</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>507</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>340</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>116</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>197</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>173</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>172</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>392</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>206</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>170</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>345</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>376</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>9,617</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The SEAI also are working to extend the solar PV grant to the non-domestic sector for installations up to 6.0kW, from August this year.     </p>  <p>  Up to the end of June this year the SEAI has supported the installation of domestic Solar PV systems for 11,581 homes since 2018, which has resulted in an installed capacity of domestic Solar PV of 45.1 MW. This translates to an average size of an installed system of 3.9 kW. Furthermore, SEAI target supporting 6,600 homes in 2022 to install Solar PV systems.</p>  <p>  On the 15 February I signed the Regulations that create an obligation on suppliers to offer the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment for excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. I am aware that some suppliers have already advertised their CEG tariff, and eligible micro-generators will start receiving CEG tariff remuneration from 1 July depending on their billing cycle. </p>  <p>  I understand that over 30,000 micro- and small-scale generators have successfully registered for export and 22,500 of this cohort have smart meters which means they are already accruing the value of the CEG tariff for their exported electricity.New installations greater than 6kW up to 50kW will be eligible for a Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff per kWh exported. The CEP will be &euro;0.135/kWh in 2022, fixed for 15 years.

However, as large energy users they also present considerable challenges to the future planning and operation of the country&rsquo;s power system.There have been major policy, market and geopolitical developments with implications for the data centre sector since the publication of the 'Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy' in mid-2018. For instance, last November, to address security of supply concerns, the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a direction to the system operators, on grid connections for data centres, which introduced strict assessment criteria by which to process applications. </p><p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment has committed, under the Climate Action Plan 2021, to reviewing its 2018 Statement on data centres, taking into account the relationship between data centres and their impact on the energy system in terms of grid constraints, renewable energy targets, sectoral emissions ceilings and security of supply. As such, in recent months D/ETE has been engaging with relevant Government Departments, including my own department, and state agencies, including the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities and EirGrid in its role as Transmission System Operator, to finalise this statement, which is due for publication later this summer.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring the Scheme prioritises those in the worst performing homes first and opening the Scheme for homeowner &lsquo;revisits&rsquo; thereby allowing them apply for deeper energy upgrade measures now available under the scheme.</p><p>- A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation has also been introduced for all households. This will help to urgently reduce energy use as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to current exceptionally high energy prices.</p><p>A total of &euro;267.2 million was allocated for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes and the Solar PV scheme in 2022 as part of the Revised Estimates Volume. The capital allocation will be amended on foot of the Supplementary Estimate for my Department.</p><p>The investment this year targets almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including over 8,600 homes to a BER of B2. Figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that to the end of June 8,628 homes have been completed across the residential energy efficiency schemes and of these, 2,681 have been upgraded to a post works Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 or better. </p><p>There are a number of Residential Schemes that offer a range of upgrade measures, therefore the average cost per Scheme will depend on many factors, including age, size, type and condition of the property and they retrofitting works required or recommended.</p><p>The number of homes completed by county under the Warmer Homes Scheme to the end of May 2022 is set out in the Table below. Currently, data on home completions per county across all schemes is not routinely reported by the SEAI.  <table>    <tr>       <th><b>County</b></th>       <th><b>2022</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>115</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>535</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>45</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>72</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total </b></td>       <td>1,453</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The average cycle time from application to completion under the Warmer Home Scheme is 28 months. However, it is important to note that cycle times have been affected by COVID related issues. In addition, there are deeper measures being provided under the Scheme since 2018, which involve more substantive works. This Scheme is a key priority for me and SEAI are working to increase output to an average of 400 per month supported by a significant increase in funding and resources.</p><p>The cycle times for the other residential and community energy upgrade schemes are a factor of the specific guidelines associated with each Scheme. Under the Better Energy Homes and Solar PV Schemes completion times are within the control of the homeowner. However, works must be completed within an 8-month period, starting from the date of grant approval. Under the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme and the Community Energy Grant Scheme retrofit projects are managed through contracts agreed between homeowners and their engaged registered One Stop Shop or Project Co-ordinator with all works required to be completed within 12-months of the signing of contracts.</p></reply>

The range of emissions reductions for the built environment published in CAP21 is 44% - 56% relative to 2018 levels and includes direct emissions associated with buildings in the residential, commercial and public sectors.    As one of the measures for achieving emissions reductions in the residential sector the National Retrofit Plan sets a target to complete 500,000 residential retrofits to achieve a B2 BER/cost optimal equivalent or carbon equivalent and the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes, by the end of 2030. </p>  <p>  The Retrofit Plan estimates that, between 2019 and 2025, almost 185,000 home energy upgrades will be delivered with over 83,000 to a B2/cost optimal level. When the emissions savings from the non-B2 upgrades are included, this is the equivalent of 120,000 B2 upgrades over the period. As a result, there will be a need to deliver, on average, approximately 75,000 B2-equivalent home upgrades per year from 2026 to 2030 to achieve the overall target of 500,000 by 2030.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan and National Retrofit Plan have ring-fenced &euro;8 billion to support the achievement of this objective.

The review of the National Development Plan (NDP) resulted in an unprecedented financial commitment to support achievement of the Government&rsquo;s retrofit targets. A total of &euro;8 billion of Exchequer funding (including &euro;5 billion in carbon tax revenues) will be available to support residential upgrades to 2030.   Achieving B2 status for homeowners is central to the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme which was launched earlier this year. The Scheme introduces a new, highly customer centric, way to undertake home upgrades. SEAI registered One-Stop-Shops will provide an end-to-end service for homeowners. This includes surveying; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors; and quality assurance. The Scheme offers unprecedented grant levels, increased from around 30% to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump.</p>  <p>  This year, the SEAI has a target to support 27,000 home energy upgrades across all schemes including 8,640 homes to a post-works Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2. </p>  <p>  Figures from the SEAI show that to the end of June, 8,628 homes have been completed across the residential and community schemes, of these 2,681 have been upgraded to a post works BER of B2 or better.</p></reply>

The Road Traffic and Roads Bill will remove e-scooters from this category and classify them instead as 'powered personal transporters'. Only vehicles which are type-approved can be registered and accordingly it is not intended that powered personal transporters will require registration.

Low-powered models, which are those which require manual input from the cyclist and are capable of achieving speeds of up to 25 km/h, will continue to be treated analogously to manual pedal cycles and registration will not be required. However, higher-powered models, which can be type-approved, will be classed as mechanically propelled vehicles and vehicle owners will therefore have to register their vehicle. The upcoming change of status for this type of vehicle was notified to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners earlier this year and my officials have been working closely with that Office to facilitate the change.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-14a.650.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400075#WRM02800"><p>As the Deputy would be aware, the NTA's Board recently approved an average increase of 12% on taxi fares from 1st September 2022, as proposed in the recent National Maximum Fares Review, which will be the first increase on such fares since 2017.  The NTA&rsquo;s 2022 driver survey shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently undertake &ldquo;night work&rdquo;.  30% of drivers (up from 17% in 2019) reported that they would consider doing &ldquo;night work&rdquo; if the relevant fares were to increase.  In recognition of this, the proposed fare increases have been weighted in favour of the premium rate that can be charged for journeys between 8.00pm to 8.00am, as well as on Sundays and public holidays. The increase in cents/euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial; however, the cumulative impact is significant for drivers, and the weighting in the increase has been designed so as to encourage more drivers to operate during these periods and also encourage drivers who may still not have come back since the pandemic, to re-activate their licences.</p>  <p>  Whilst the NTA has statutory responsibility for regulating the SPSV industry, taxi drivers are self-employed individuals and, as such, decide on their own business strategies within the regulatory framework, including choosing the times at which they operate.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department and the NTA previously introduced a number of supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licensed SPSVs to continue in the industry during this very difficult period.  The SPSV motor tax refund scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the SPSV industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. I announced this support on 9 June 2021 and an allocation of &euro;2m in funding was provided.  The Scheme commenced on 1 September 2021 ensuring that SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax. The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022.</p>  <p>  The NTA also introduced the NCT Initial Test Fee Waiver Scheme for the SPSV sector on September 1st 2021, with funding of &euro;1.5m from my Department.  As a result, SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free.  This Scheme also ends on 31 August 2022.</p>  <p>  The NTA extended vehicle age limits several times during the pandemic, with standard age limits for taxis and hackneys now waived through to end-2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.  The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period. It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licensees will return now that demand for services is increasing.</p>  <p>  Supports are available to drivers wishing to change their vehicles.  I allocated &euro;2m to the wheelchair accessible grant scheme for this year (WAV22).  Under this Scheme, the NTA informed me recently that 102 new WAV licences have been added to the SPSV fleet to date in 2022, and 26 replacement vehicles have been upgraded. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles. The electric small public service vehicle (eSPSV) grant scheme was put in place to support the greening of the taxi sector. The Scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the NTA. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use, and &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric.</p>  <p>  eSPSV22 was paused for new applications in April to allow operators with grant offers the time to finalise their car purchase and draw down funding. The Department announced on 26 June 2022 that eSPSV22 will re-open for applications on 1 August, and the application form will be published on the NTA's website that same day. Applications will be accepted up to 30 November 2022 for this Scheme, with no extension being considered.  Vehicles must be licensed (passed the suitability inspection) by 31 December 2022 to get the funding. If this has not happened, operators must wait and apply to any future grant Schemes which might be launched by the Department. </p>  <p>  You may be aware that Microfinance Ireland is still providing the so-called eSPSV Business Loan, which is available to support SPSV owners that are unable to secure finance from banks and asset finance providers, and are availing of the eSPSV Grant Scheme to replace their vehicle with a more sustainable model (electric/hybrid).  These loans range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000, with a fixed interest rate of 4.5% if submitted through a Local Enterprise Office, and with no additional fees or charges.</p>  <p>  I recognise that rising fuel costs are a significant challenge for all sectors and, that is why the Government announced on March 9th last, a temporary reduction in fuel-related excise duties of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel.  These reductions, which were due to finish at the end of August, will be extended until Budget Day on September 27th, at an additional cost of circa &euro;80 million, and should help reduce the operating costs of all private and commercial vehicle owners, including non-electric SPSV operators.</p></reply>

It was administered by the Department of Transport, and it is now closed. There was good uptake of the Scheme, with over &euro;15 million paid out to nearly 3,000 operators.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) remains available to licensed haulage operators in respect of vehicles over 7.5 tonnes. At diesel prices over &euro;1.43 (including VAT), the maximum rebate of 7.5 cent per litre is provided. It has always been the case that some operators that are eligible for the DRS do not take it up. The Department would strongly encourage all such operators to make the most of the supports that are available.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, tax debt &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; during the COVID crisis remains at an interest rate of 0% for the remainder of this year.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Government has also acted to offset the rising cost of fuel through a reduction in Excise on fuels - a reduction of 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel fuel. While this measure (announced in early March 2022) was originally proposed to last until 31 August 2022 the Government has extended it out to Budget Day 2022. This measure provides assistance to all citizens and businesses to help mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the causes of the current fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. </p>  <p>  Since early March with the benefit of the excise reduction, 8 weeks support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief, haulage businesses will have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy. </p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. </p></reply>

In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government provided temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. These supports were extended up to the 30th of June 2022 with <i>c.</i>&euro;65m provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.</p><p>Further, in recognition of rising fuel costs for all citizens and businesses, on the 10th of March the Government introduced an excise duty reduction of 15 cent per litre of diesel, initially introduced until the end of August but later extended out to Budget Day.</p><p>In addition to these measures, and in view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. </p><p>The YAC was initially launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, and will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings. </p><p>The time lag is due to the fact that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives, such as the YAC, on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. An array of various ticketing equipment is in use on fleet used by the commercial operators and needs to be catered for. To expedite the process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card in as timely a manner as possible.</p></reply>

It is aimed at improving air quality in urban areas, reducing the CO2 emissions of a sector which typically has very high mileage, and also can positively influence the uptake of zero emission passenger cars by improving general perception and awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles. </p>  <p>  The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use. The Scheme is funded by the Department and administered by NTA acting as agents of the Department with delegated authority and as the licensing authority for SPSVs. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support SPSVs to switch to electric.</p>  <p>  The scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to new applicants to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers which usually have a time limit of three months.  In addition, applicants can apply for a further three month provisional grant offer extension if they have a letter from their dealer stating that the vehicle will be delivered within this timeframe. Once these grant offers have been drawn down, there will be a clearer picture of the funding available for the second half of the year, and I anticipate the scheme will reopen for applications at the beginning of next month.</p></reply>

The &euro;35bn investment allocation, which funds delivery of the plan, is designed to support investment in protection and renewal of road, rail and active travel infrastructure; the optimisation of existing infrastructure; as well as investing in new assets and infrastructure where appropriate.</p>  <p>  Protection and renewal of regional and local roads is an important investment strand in the NDP and in 2022 from an overall capital allocation of 2.547bn received a budget of 490m or 19% of the total allocation. In addition, from a current expenditure allocation of 885.494m, protection and renewal of regional and local roads received 45.916m. The final sectoral allocations are decided during the Revised Estimates process each year, which concludes in late November or early December. </p>  <p>  If additional capital becomes available for re-allocation in a given year, the merits of re-allocating to regional and local roads protection and renewal will of course be considered. There are no plans to re-allocate capital at present. As is standard practice, should capital become available for re-allocation, a review of all spending areas will take place, including regional and local roads protection and renewal, to determine the most appropriate spending areas to re-allocate capital to in the context of meeting annual and medium term investment objectives.</p>  <p>  I trust this information is of assistance. </p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts. </p><p>Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.  In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.</p><p>In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, these supports for the commercial sector were recently extended up to the 30<sup>th</sup>of June 2022. To date, <i>c.</i>&euro;65m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.</p><p>It is envisaged that the Young Adult Card (YAC) will be broadened to include commercial operators at a later date. However, it is important to note that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives such as the Young Adult Card on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. As such, it will take longer to make this fare discount available to Commercial Bus Operators.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is in detailed discussions with transport operators and the Department of Transport regarding the range of issues that need to be addressed.  To assist with this process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card on Commercial Bus Operators in as timely a manner as possible, taking account of current ticketing capabilities to ensure a viable scheme is implemented</p><p>The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, in light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to Commercial Bus Operators and the youth travel card scheme, to the NTA for direct reply.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts. </p><p>The 20% fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations.  I would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023; however, I am acutely aware of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so I will work closely with Minister McGrath and other Government colleagues in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services. </p><p>It should be noted that the 20% fare reduction comes on top of several other measures that we are progressing to encourage greater public transport patronage. For instance, the Young Adult Card, which provides an average 50% fare discount for those aged between 19 and 23 on both PSO and commercial services. As well as the TFI 90 Minute Fares scheme which means that adults now pay &euro;2, young adults pay &euro;1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin. </p><p>While fare reductions are to be welcomed, investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, I am committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+ as well as improving existing services across the country.</p><p>The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.

A passenger's rights are clear where baggage is not returned within 21 days of the flight, the airline concerned should treat the baggage as lost and settle the passenger's claim on that basis. The air carrier liability for baggage delay is limited to 1,000 Special Drawing Rights which are linked to an exchange rate which approximates to &euro;1,300 at present.</p>  <p>  Airlines have different policies in respect to reimbursing passengers while they await their baggage, some offer a small payment, others would expect passenger to make a claim with evidence of expenses incurred. Where a passenger has already engaged with the airline or is not satisfied with the level of compensation received, if any, they may seek resolution though the Small Claims Court. </p>  <p>  Resource challenges across many European airports are resulting in some customers experiencing a level of service below what they expect, including delayed baggage at Dublin Airport. Although Dublin Airport provides the baggage system infrastructure in the terminals, they are not responsible for the handling of baggage which is looked after by the airline and their chosen handling partner. </p>  <p>  In response to the challenges, I am advised that airport teams on the ground are continuing to work closely with all the relevant airlines and handling agents to retrieve delayed or misdirected baggage as quickly and efficiently as possible. I understand that airlines have increased resourcing and adapted their processes to enhance the speed at which third party transport companies can deliver delayed bags to affected customers.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that Dublin airport have completed a relocation of all bags from the T1 baggage hall to a landside location which is convenient for passengers with sufficient parking and access. It is expected that this will speed up the baggage repatriation process as both handlers and couriers will not require badged access to this area.</p></reply>

A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication.</p><p>Preparations are also underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p><p>Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home. This means that the majority of EV users will never need to access the public network except for longer journeys.</p><p>A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p><p>There is a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as non-residential neighbourhood charging, destination charging, and motorway charging. </p><p>A significant increase in funding for public charging points will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.</p><p>The existing Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs.</p><p>I can confirm to the deputy that three County Councils applications have been approved under the current Public Points Scheme. The number of charge points per County Council is outlined in the below table: <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>Number of Charge Points Approved per applications </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City Council</td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth County Council </td>       <td>20 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary County Council </td>       <td>4 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department has reviewed the Scheme and the draft Strategy sets out a number of additional actions to support delivery by local authorities, such as funding capital costs for civil and electrics works, as well as charge point installation, through a new Residential Charging Scheme.</p><p>My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 62,000 at the end of June.</p><p>In addition, the Department convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group</i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. In particular, the group examined the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies. The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is available online.</p><p>In line with the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to support the transition to EVs:  </p><p>- The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland has been retained until at least end-2022.

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.</p><p>As the Deputy has referenced, in order to avail of the HTB incentive, the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) for a property must be 70% or more. In the case of a self build residence, the lender will apply a valuation using the Central Bank of Ireland's macro prudential mortgage rules, which consists of the aggregate of the market value of the land and the estimated costs of construction. It should be noted that the Central Bank is independent in the decision of its macro prudential rules.</p><p>The HTB scheme, as announced in Budget 2017, was initially intended to be limited to persons who had mortgages with a minimum LTV of 80%.  However, Central Bank data indicated that a sizeable number of first-time buyers take out a mortgage with a LTV of less than 80%. As such, It was decided to amend the scheme in the Finance Bill to set the minimum LTV at 70% so as to ensure that first-time buyers did not feel compelled to borrow larger amounts than they would have otherwise in order to qualify for the scheme.</p><p>According to published Revenue statistics, from the inception of the scheme to 30 June 2022, self-builds have represented 25.48% of approved claims. However, to end 2021, the proportion of claims in the 70% to 85% LTV bands are much higher for self-builds, accounting for more than 40% of all claims. The nature of self-builds is such that an applicant may already own the land on which the house is built which means that they are likely to need to borrow only in relation to construction costs.</p><p>Individuals who are in the fortunate position of being able to avail of a mortgage at a lower loan-to-value ratio than 70% are considered to have sufficient resources to more than meet the deposit requirements of the macro-prudential rules and thus less in need of assistance from the Exchequer. The objective of the scheme is to stimulate the housing market at the entry level and not to provide supports to individuals who are seeking houses at the upper ends of the market.</p><p>It is not at all clear that it would be fair or equitable to allow for different eligibility criteria with regard to LTV ratios in respect of self-build properties vis-&aacute;-vis that which applies to all other new build homes. As such, I do not currently plan to amend the scheme in the manner that has been suggested by the Deputy.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that work by external consultants, Mazars, on the review of HTB is nearing completion. The outcome of this comprehensive review will help to inform decisions on the future of the scheme beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2022. However, this is a matter that will fall to be considered by Government in the context of the Budget 2023 process and it would not be appropriate for me to offer further comment at this time.</p></reply>

The second Implementation Report, which was published on 1 March 2022, shows that 80 per cent of the actions contained in the <i>Action Plan</i>are now being delivered. </p><p>The establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which is chaired by Minister of State Fleming, is a <i>Programme for Government </i>commitment. Its aims are to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. </p><p>Since its establishment, the Office has held over 90 meetings with a range of stakeholders, including insurance companies and representative stakeholder organisations. As part of this, the Office is working closely with IDA Ireland to help leverage the ongoing insurance reforms with the aim of targeting new entrants to the Irish market, or persuading current incumbents to expand their risk appetite. This will, in the first instance, target providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market, such as the leisure sector and other sectors having difficulty in obtaining public liability insurance. Due to the successes of the Government reform agenda, such as the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines which have now reduced awards by an average of 40 per cent, I am confident that the IDA now has a very positive message to deliver. Upcoming developments, such as the reform of the Duty of Care, will further enhance this by addressing the issue of &lsquo;slips, trips and falls&rsquo; which is particularly prevalent in high-footfall/high-risk public-facing sectors. There are positive indications of some firms expanding their risk appetite into a number of these areas. </p><p>Finally, the recent NCID report contains much that is encouraging. It demonstrates that 57 per cent of &lsquo;packaged&rsquo; EL/PL/commercial property policies had premiums of less than &euro;1,000 and 92 per cent less than &euro;5,000.  Only 2 per cent had premiums over &euro;25,000. </p><p>I wish to assure the Deputies of my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure further implementation of the <i>Action Plan</i>which should have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for all consumers.</p></reply>

It has been publicly announced that in response to a European Commission investigation, Insurance Ireland has provided a series of commitments to overhaul access to the InsuranceLink database, including the creation of an independent application and appeals process. Following a consultation period, and a number of amendments to the initial proposals, the Commission has now found that Insurance Ireland's final commitments will ensure market participants' access to the InsuranceLink platform, and has decided to make them legally binding on Insurance Ireland. These are anchored in EU anti-trust laws and will remain in force for 10 years, as well as being monitored by the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that Insurance Ireland has provided these commitments to reform access to the InsuranceLink database, including enhanced governance arrangements, which will ensure equitable and transparent access to this data. Information sharing and data analysis have become increasingly important in promoting competition in the insurance sector and encouraging new entrants. Therefore the solution arrived at between the European Commission and Insurance Ireland should both maintain market competition and protect customer choice in the private motor insurance market. </p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this Government is continuing to prioritise insurance reform through the whole-of-Government Action Plan for Insurance Reform. The Personal Injuries Guidelines represent a key achievement of this reform agenda, with recent data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board indicating that the overall average award has fallen by 42 per cent compared to awards made in 2020 under the Book of Quantum. Given this pace of reform, and the many other measures being implemented, it is necessary for the insurance industry to pass on benefits to its hard-pressed customers. Both Minister of State Fleming and I have been clear on these points and have been holding the insurance sector to account, in so far as it is permissible, on commitments made.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has met individually with the CEOs of the eight main insurers in the Irish market on a number of occasions since the adoption of the Guidelines. In these meetings, and in ongoing engagement with industry, Minister of State Fleming has consistently stressed the importance of insurers reflecting lower claims costs through reduced premiums. These engagements have been positive, with insurers confirming their commitment to passing on savings from the Guidelines. During these meetings, it was also impressed upon insurers the need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Claims Information Database (NCID) contains a wealth of information on premium prices and claims costs, and is unique in Europe in terms of the transparency it brings to the insurance sector. Following the introduction of the Guidelines, the Central Bank has amended the NCID data specification and will collect further claim settlement data. I look forward to the publication of the fourth Private Motor Report later this year, which will provide data up to the end of 2021, and should show some initial insight into the impact of the Guidelines. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that it will take time for the Guidelines to take effect, particularly in terms of Court settlements, as there are still a number of existing claims before the Courts which will be assessed under the Book of Quantum. In addition, buy-in from all stakeholders is vital if the Guidelines are to have the expected effect, and it will take a period of time for their true impact to be felt. In the meantime, the Government will continue to engage with stakeholders in relation to their use, as well as with the Central Bank with regards to enhancing the NCID to monitor their impact.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-14a.782.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400077#WRO04700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 and 288 together.</p>  <p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, this Government recognises the concerns felt by many groups regarding the cost and availability of insurance, and has therefore prioritised insurance reform via the Action Plan for Insurance Reform which was published in December 2020. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government published the second Action Plan for Insurance Reform Implementation Report in March this year, which shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 80 per cent of the actions already being delivered.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan is a whole-of-Government strategy contains several initiatives expected to positively impact insurance costs. For example, the Personal Injuries Guidelines (implemented in April 2021) have significantly lowered award levels for many common injuries, with the latest data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) indicating that the overall average award has reduced by 42 per cent compared to 2020. Consistent implementation of the Guidelines should therefore lead to a reduction in the cost of claims, which is the main driver of the cost of insurance.</p>  <p>  Another key development with regard to home and motor insurance costs has been the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Regulations to prohibit price walking from 1 July 2022. This is a form of dual pricing whereby customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with an insurance provider. This ban is a balanced approach that will protect customers who prefer to stay with their current provider from being subject to a &lsquo;loyalty penalty&rsquo;, while still allowing customers to benefit from discounts from new providers.</p>  <p>  Recent legislation (the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022), commenced on 8 July, responds to this development and includes a requirement for the Central Bank of Ireland to submit a report to the Minister for Finance setting out the steps it has taken since regulating price walking. The Act provides for this report to be submitted within an 18-month timeframe from enactment, and for it to be laid before the Oireachtas upon receipt. This will allow for timely oversight of the price walking ban by Government and the Oireachtas, to determine whether further measures need to be taken to address the issue. The legislation also addresses a number of further insurance issues that have arisen since the publication of the Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Some of the other achievements to date aimed at reducing costs include:  </p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which aims to lower costs by promoting greater competition in the Irish market; </p>  <p>  - the enhancement of the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) through the Competition (Amendment) Act 2022; and</p>  <p>  - measures to reduce fraud, including the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021, which places perjury on a statutory footing for the first time.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing across Government to drive forward the outstanding aspects of the Action Plan. This includes further legislative changes intended to reduce costs, including:</p>  <p>  - the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022, which will strengthen the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to ensure more cases settle at that stage instead of proceeding to costlier litigation (this is under the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment); and</p>  <p>  - the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, which will contain amendments to the Occupiers&rsquo; Liability Act 1995 to rebalance the duty of care (this is under the responsibility of the Minister for Justice). </p>  <p>  It is my belief that the overall implementation of the Action Plan should help to improve both the cost and availability of insurance. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would also note that recent data from the Central Statistics Office shows that average private motor insurance prices have fallen by 41 per cent since their peak in July 2016, and it is my hope that these ongoing reforms will bolster this downward trend in the wider insurance market, to the benefit of consumers, businesses and community groups.</p></reply>

The second Implementation Report, which was published on 1 March 2022, shows that 80 per cent of the actions contained in the Action Plan are now being delivered. </p>  <p>  The establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which is chaired by Minister of State Fleming, is a Programme for Government commitment. Its aims are to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. In that regard, the Office is working closely with IDA Ireland to help leverage the ongoing insurance reforms with the aim of targeting new entrants to the Irish market or encouraging current incumbents to expand into underserved areas. Since its establishment, the Office has held over 90 meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, voluntary groups and representative bodies on issues surrounding competition. Minister Fleming also met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland, and they have confirmed that they are passing on savings achieved as a result of Government reforms to customers. The Office has also cooperated with the Central Bank to create a databank for new market entrants, which was launched on 8 February 2022. This databank is an additional source of information for insurance providers who are considering entering the Irish market, as it provides &lsquo;one-stop&rsquo; access to key sources of information on insurance in Ireland, and showcases the high-quality work being done in data collection by the Central Bank, such as the National Claims Information Database (NCID). </p>  <p>  Through initiatives such as the Action Plan, this Government is committed to securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland. In this regard, it is my intention to continue working with my Government colleagues to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan, which will bring benefits to the wider economy and society. </p></reply>

Some taxpayers may have overpaid tax in some years and underpaid in others and some may be entitled to additional credits or reliefs which they have not yet claimed while others may have additional income on which tax may be due.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that, to date, Revenue has refunded &euro;430m to 620,000 taxpayers in respect of the 2021 tax year. In respect of tax year 2020, &euro;440m has been refunded to 660,000 taxpayers, while just over &euro;500m was refunded to 800,000 taxpayers in respect of 2019.</p>  <p>  Revenue has further advised that a Preliminary End of Year statement is made available to PAYE taxpayers through the myAccount service after the end of each tax year. The Preliminary End of Year Statement sets out each taxpayer&rsquo;s provisional tax position for that tax year, based on information available on Revenue records.</p>  <p>  To claim a refund of overpaid tax, taxpayers should complete an income tax return. The quickest and easiest way to do this is online through Revenue&rsquo;s myAccount facility. The information on Revenue&rsquo;s records is prepopulated on the individual&rsquo;s income tax return.  This simplified facility encourages taxpayers to claim their entitlements and ensure as far as possible, that they pay the right amount of tax at the right time.</p>  <p>  Revenue is currently writing to taxpayers who may have overpaid or underpaid tax in these years, inviting them to submit returns to finalise their tax position and over 50,000 taxpayers have been written to in the past month in this regard.</p>  <p>  Based on the provisional end-of-year position for PAYE taxpayers who have not submitted an Income Tax return, Revenue records indicate that there are approximately 300,000 customers who have not filed a tax return for 2019 and who may have overpaid tax in that year by &euro;10 or more. The provisional figures indicate that the potential amount overpaid is &euro;170m.</p>  <p>  The equivalent provisional figures for 2020 are &euro;150m potentially overpaid in respect of 270,000 customers, while provisional figures for 2021 indicate that approximately &euro;300m is potentially overpaid in respect of 450,000 customers in 2021.</p>  <p>  Revenue further advises that the overall numbers of taxpayers who may have overpaid tax is less than the aggregate of the above figures as some customers may have overpaid tax in one or more of the years shown. Similarly, the net amount of tax overpaid will be less than the aggregate of the figures shown as Revenue records indicate that taxpayers may have overpaid in some years and underpaid in others.</p>  <p>  Revenue will continue to communicate directly with taxpayers who have over/underpaid balances per their Preliminary End of Year statement.</p></reply>

Therefore it is not possible to provide estimates based on such a small cohort of taxpayers.  However, based on publicly available information as to the bank&rsquo;s profitability levels, a limit of 25% or 50% on the tax losses forward that can be used in one year would likely not yield significant additional tax, due to the amounts of losses forward available to the banks.</p>  <p>  A five-year absolute limit on the carry forward of losses would mean that the banks would no longer be able to use the historic losses that are being carried forward since the financial crisis. The likely additional tax yield from such a measure would depend on the banks future profitability levels which cannot be accurately estimated at present.</p>  <p>  The value of these tax losses to the State is realised through share sales. The banks share prices recognise a certain value for the tax losses and as such the State will continue to receive value for the balance of tax losses as future sell-downs complete. There would be a negative impact on the valuation of the State&rsquo;s investments in the banks from a change in tax treatment of losses carried forward.</p>  <p>  Despite the scale of losses accumulated, the banks contribute to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy. It should also be noted that loss relief does not shelter profits made by the bank in all their corporate entities.</p>  <p>  In 2018 Department of Finance officials produced a detailed technical note for the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the subject of both bank losses and corporation tax losses more generally (see www.gov.ie/en/publication/436ff7-technical-note-on-the-potential-consequences-of-changes-to-the-treat/). It was further updated and re-circulated to members during the 2019 Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

The Sheriffs are Officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945.  Their debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended.  The execution of Revenue referrals (warrants) is specifically provided for in Section 960L of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Revenue suspended debt collection enforcement in line with the Government&rsquo;s introduction of the Debt Warehousing Scheme to provide a vital liquidity support to businesses experiencing cash-flow and trading difficulties due to the pandemic.  Under the scheme, businesses can temporarily &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain tax debts on an interest free basis until the end of this year (or until 30 April 2023 for businesses impacted by the public health restrictions introduced in December 2021).  Almost 90,000 individual entities are availing of Debt Warehousing to the value of almost &euro;2.9 billion. Consequently, these debts are not subject to current enforcement action and the level of referrals for enforcement of collection by sheriffs shown in the table below reflects that fact.</p>  <p>  oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-07-15_pq312-14-07-22_en.docx</p>  <p>  I am advised that coming towards the end of this year, Revenue will engage with all businesses availing of the debt warehousing scheme to agree suitable phased payment arrangements in respect of the &lsquo;parked&rsquo; liability. The payment arrangements will be flexible and tailored to take account of the financial circumstances of each business concerned.  Provided returns are filed for all periods covered by the debt warehousing scheme and current returns are filed and taxes are paid as they fall due, these parked debts will remain in the debt warehouse and a reduced interest rate of 3% will apply to phased payments arrangements for the payment of those debts.</p>  <p>  The table below provides the number of warrants issued to the Sheriffs from 2017 to 30 June 2022, broken down by county.</p></reply>

This is an increase of &euro;1.7 billion relative to what was originally provided for and will ensure that support is provided to households to help with the higher cost of living. </p>  <p>  This will result in an increase to the 2022 and 2023 core expenditure growth rates to 6 per cent and 6&frac12; per cent respectively. &euro;80.5 billion in core expenditure will now be available for 2022 with &euro;85.8 billion in 2023.

Following the Revised Estimates in December 2021, &euro;3.9 billion of this funding remained unallocated. This contingency is held in reserve centrally to allow Government flexibility to respond to emerging needs during the year. </p><p>In February 2022, the Government announced a suite of measures to assist with costs of living pressures. This included the Electricity Credit to domestic account holders, which had an estimated cost of &euro;400 million. This required a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, given the scale of this amount in relation to the original Estimate for Vote 29. This Supplementary Estimate was brought before the D&aacute;il in March to provide an additional allocation of &euro;271 million with the remaining cost funded through reallocation of existing Vote 29 resources. Following this development, the remaining contingency balance stood at just under &euro;3.7 billion. </p><p>While this is the only draw down from the contingency funding allocated in Departmental Estimates in the first six months of 2022, there are significant pressures and commitments on the remaining funding including:</p><p>1. Further Covid support measures, including the response to the Omicron wave will require additional funding over that foreseen at the time of Budget 2022. This includes income and employment support schemes in the Department of Social Protection, Department of Health Covid-19 response, the targeted Commercial Rates Waiver for Q1 2022 and Department of Education Covid response measures.  These Covid-19 expenditure pressures are evident in the end June expenditure reported in the Fiscal Monitor with gross current expenditure in the Department of Social Protection &euro;292 million ahead of profile and &euro;284 million ahead of profile in the Department of Health. </p><p>2. Additional allocations may be required to fund the other cost of living measures announced in throughout the first six months of 2022.</p><p>3. Costs related to the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine will also need to be provided. Ultimate costs will depend on the numbers of refugees arriving, the length of stay, labour market participation over time and the accommodation solutions provided. There is considerable uncertainty in relation to these elements and it is too early to say how much will be required from the contingency at this point. To date approximately &euro;186 million has been spent across a number of Departments. </p><p>4. An additional Supplementary Estimate of &euro;110 million was presented to the D&aacute;il at the beginning of July for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to make funds available to address security of energy supply for winter 2023/24 as set out in the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022 </p><p>Further allocations from the contingency will be considered later in the year taking account of any offsetting underspends.  </p><p>No allocations have been made in respect of Ukraine-related expenditure in the first six months of the year with pressures being managed within Departments expenditure ceilings.

It also provides for the transposition of Directive (EU) 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law. The Bill provides for enhanced protections, notably:</p>  <p>  - the extension of the existing protections of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 to a wider cohort including volunteers, shareholders, persons belonging to the administrative, management or supervisory body of an undertaking, and persons going through a recruitment process or in pre-contractual negotiations,</p>  <p>  - reversal of the burden of proof during proceedings at the Workplace Relations Commission and the courts,</p>  <p>  - access to interim relief at the Circuit Court against penalisation, and </p>  <p>  - providing for criminal penalties for penalisation.</p>  <p>  Following a recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report and at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in February of this year, I signalled my intent to consider how to make provision for retrospective protection where possible. At each stage when this Bill has been considered, I have updated members of the House on progress in this regard, and my commitment to go as far as possible to provide retrospective protection, where possible, to persons who have reported relevant wrongdoing within the meaning of the Act prior to the Bill's forthcoming enactment. In light of my instruction to provide retrospective protection as broadly as possible, the amendments required careful consideration by my officials in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. The amendments introduced at Committee Stage in the Seanad fulfil the commitment I gave to the Houses on this matter.</p>  <p>  The amendments I have introduced provide that a worker who reports a relevant wrongdoing before the Bill is enacted but suffers penalisation after the Bill is enacted is entitled to the enhanced protections of the amended legislation, including the reversal of burden of proof in civil proceedings at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the courts.</p>  <p>  The amendments further provide that a worker (as defined in the 2014 Act) who reports a relevant wrongdoing and suffers penalisation before the Bill is enacted but has not initiated proceedings at the WRC or the courts will be entitled to the reversal of the burden of proof in such proceedings.  I am satisfied in light of my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the Office of the Attorney General that it is not possible to apply those changes to existing proceedings, since that would involve interfering with already existing litigation.  To seek to apply new rules to cases where proceedings have already issued would be unfair and give rise to legal issues.  This is especially so where there is already a Court decision in place.</p>  <p>  Section 13 of the Protected Disclosures Act provides that, "If a person causes detriment to another person because the other person or a third person made a protected disclosure, the person to whom the detriment is caused has a right of action in tort against the person by whom the detriment is caused". </p>  <p>  Section 22 of the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill provides for the insertion of a new subsection - (2B) -  into section 13 of the 2014 Act, which provides that, "In any proceedings under this section in respect of alleged detriment caused to a person, the detriment so caused shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have been caused as a result of the person or another person having made a protected disclosure, unless the person whom it is alleged caused the detriment proves that the act or omission concerned was based on duly justified grounds."</p>  <p>  The effect of subsection (2B) is to reverse the burden of proof in any tort proceedings taken under section 13, so that the court must assume that the alleged detriment occurred because of a protected disclosure, unless the defendant can prove otherwise. This  is to give effect to Article 21.5 of the Directive.</p>  <p>  Paragraphs 3 and 5 of Schedule 7 of the Bill provide for the retrospective application of this provision to persons who have reported before the enactment of the Bill but suffer retaliation after enactment. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 7 provides for the retrospective application of this provision to persons who have reported and suffered penalisation before enactment but have not initiated proceedings in the Workplace Relations Commission or the courts. Without these provisions in Schedule 7, Section 13(2B) will not have any retrospective application, i.e. it will only apply to protected disclosures made after the enactment of the Bill.</p></reply>

Where necessary, Local Authorities may put forward proposals to relevant central Government Departments, including the Office of Public Works, for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat. </p>  <p>  Under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management. Full details of this scheme are available on www.opw.ie.</p>  <p>  Mayo County Council carried out a Feasibility Report (funded by the Office of Public Works) in September of last year. This report estimated the cost of addressing the issues here at &euro;6.4m with the majority of the benefits coming from the protection of road infrastructure, thus identifying a potential role for the Department of Transport. The capital cost is now well in excess of the &euro;750,000 ceiling for Minor Flood Mitigation Works.</p>  <p>  As the report indicated that the majority of the benefits from the proposed scheme would be to roads and access, Mayo County Council were advised in February this year to develop a joint proposal for the scheme with the Department of Transport and to subsequently meet with OPW to review the joint proposal.</p>  <p>  On the 9th June 2022, the Minister met with a delegation of local stakeholders and representatives of Mayo County Council to discuss the flooding issues relating to the Neale. It was agreed that Mayo County Council will finalise the feasibility review report, include options assessment and forward to the OPW. The OPW will review this feasibility report. Following that review, the OPW will convene a meeting with Mayo Co. Co, Dept of Transport and the OPW to discuss possible funding options for a scheme for this area, given the majority of benefits are to roads and road access. The Minister indicated that the outcome of that meeting will inform what scheme can be progressed. This will be convened by the Office of Public Works once the review of the feasibility report is complete.</p></reply>

This expenditure is defined as the Government Expenditure Ceiling in the Minister&rsquo;s and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2012 as the sum of expenditure which is met out of: </p>  <p>  - money supplied out of supply grants and appropriations-in-aid in respect of supply services,   </p>  <p>  - money paid out of the Social Insurance Fund, and   </p>  <p>  - money paid out of the National Training Fund.</p>  <p>  The Government Expenditure Ceiling aggregates individual Ministerial Expenditure ceilings, i.e. the National Training Fund spend must be included within a Ministerial ceiling.  Therefore an increase in expenditure from the NTF, all other things being equal, would require an increase in the relevant Ministerial and overall Government expenditure ceilings.  While spending from the surplus of the NTF has no impact on the Exchequer Balance, it would be included in general government expenditure and consequently worsen the General Government deficit.  For that reason the legislation provides that both the expenditure of the SIF and NTF form part of the expenditure ceiling.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Finance that if the National Training Fund was to reduce its investments in Exchequer Notes, there would be a corresponding reduction in the National Debt, all other things being equal.  However, there would not be any reduction in General Government Debt as the National Training Fund is within General Government so any lending/borrowing is consolidated.</p></reply>

That scheme has its origins in section 4 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963, which, in short, provides that a person who is employed in a pensionable capacity in an &ldquo;approved organisation&rdquo;, may transfer pensionable service from one approved organisation to another. </p>  <p>  The transfer scheme rules do also provide a mechanism by which an individual may reckon (i.e. have service deemed pensionable) and transfer prior non-pensionable service, subject to certain eligibility criteria. Part 1, paragraph 2(2) of the 1979 letter allows for an individual to reckon such service, stating that the person must have belonged to a category of employees which was not covered by a pension scheme at the time and:</p>  <p>  the organisation subsequently introduced a pension scheme for the category of employee concerned, </p>  <p>  or</p>  <p>  the organisation&rsquo;s pension scheme allows for the reckoning of such service in the event of the member being appointed to a post covered by the scheme (for example, a temporary employee appointed to a permanent post).</p>  <p>  Service will not be transferable where the person has opted out of the first organisation's pension scheme. However, where, subsequent to the date on which the person left the organisation, that organisation's employees were allowed to change any such option, the person may, if he so chooses, be deemed to have changed his option. ( Letter to Personnel Officers 30 January 1981, par. 2(d))</p>  <p>  In any such cases the employee will be required to make an appropriate payment to the second employer in respect of any contribution (including interest) which they would have been required to pay, or would have had an option to pay, in respect of the service now becoming reckonable, if they had remained in the first group. Any retained benefits paid in respect of the prior service would also be required to be refunded plus interest.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, it is a matter for the original employing body to determine whether the prior service given could be deemed pensionable subject to the criteria set out in the transfer scheme. Should the body require assistance in that regard, they can contact the pensions policy section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Production continued throughout 2021 despite the very great challenges of COVID-19.  Levels of employment across the industry have been particularly high.</p>  <p>  The Government has a range of measures to encourage activity in the audiovisual industry including the Section 481 tax relief and direct grant to projects from Screen Ireland and the Sound and Vision fund.</p>  <p>  The Government's Audiovisual Action Plan aims to provide the necessary environment for Ireland to become a global hub for the production of Film, TV drama and animation. The Plan recognises Section 481 as a vital part of the financial infrastructure of the audio-visual industry in Ireland and underlines the need to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and achieves its objectives.  My Department is in ongoing collaboration with the Department of Finance to ensure that the tax relief is kept up to date and in line with international incentives.</p>  <p>  Screen Ireland's mission is to support and promote Irish film, television and animation through fostering Irish artistic vision and our diverse creative and production talent, growing audiences, and attracting filmmakers and investment into the country.  The funding allocation for Screen Ireland increased in 2022 by &euro;6.65m compared to 2021. The total allocation for 2022 is &euro;36.743 million - an increase of 22.1%. Screen Ireland&rsquo;s 3-year strategic Plan &lsquo;Building for a Creative Future 2024&rsquo; sets out how it plans to support this important sector including championing development that is national and sustainable, supporting Irish companies and an expanded workforce. Screen Ireland also wants to ensure large-scale mobile productions are enabled to complete their full project in Ireland, including valuable animation, post-production and Visual Effects (VFX) work. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) continues to develop and implement the broadcasting funding schemes that support an increase in the production and availability of diverse, innovative and culturally relevant Irish audio-visual content.  In 2020, &euro;15,769m was allocated by BAI to Sound and Vision projects.  In 2021, the equivalent figure was approximately &euro;16m.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, the trade union SIPTU and Screen Producers Ireland (SPI) announced a new Shooting Crew agreement.  The agreement covers pay rates for live-action films and TV production as well as working conditions. The new agreement, came into effect on 1 January 2021 and is reported to be working well and being observed by all parties.  The recent passing of the ballot on a national Construction Agreement for the Irish Film and Television industry is welcomed and will act as an important framework for the industry in setting consistent standards and enhancing work practices. The Construction Agreement covers several important measures and these agreements will help provide a level of certainty and stability for workers in the Irish Film and Television industry.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with the Central Statistics Office to deepen the statistical information collected on employment and activity in the Arts &amp;amp; Culture sectors and this has the potential to add to research and statistical analysis about the levels of employment and unemployment in the audiovisual sector and the various occupational categories within the industry.</p></reply>

To this end, funding was initially targeted at the less intrusive cavity wall insulation as well as attic/roof insulation.</p><p><b>Phase 2</b>focused on the fabric upgrade works to those remaining dwellings with solid/hollow block wall construction and includes the provision of heating upgrades.</p><p>The previous programme was withdrawn in 2021 with the introduction of a new holistic Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme that focuses on ensuring that the fabric of the home is upgraded and an energy efficient heating system is provided. The programme will see a significant upscaling on what has been completed by local authorities in previous years.</p><p>This new enhanced ten year energy efficiency programme was launched in response to a commitment made under the Programme for Government, which called for the 'retrofit' of 500,000 homes to a B2/Cost Optimal Equivalent BER standard by 2030, of which approximately 36,500 are expected to be local authority owned homes.</p><p>The 2022 Energy Efficiency Retrofitting programme has seen a significant increase in funding support to local authorities to &euro;85 million, allowing approximately 2,400 homes nationally to be upgraded to a B2 or Cost Optimal Equivalent Standard.</p><p>A breakdown of the funding provided and the output per local authority since 2013 to 2021 can be found on the Department website:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/668c1-energy-efficiency-retrofitting-programme-expenditure-output/</p><p>My Department also introduced a pilot Midlands Energy Retrofit Programme in 2020-2022, the details of which are at the link. A further 146 properties were retrofitted to a BER of B2/ Cost Optimal Equivalent and these figures are in addition to the National Retrofit Programme.</p><p>gov.ie - Midlands Energy Retrofit Programme - Expenditure and Units (www.gov.ie)</p><p>Work in relation to the 2022 programme is underway but it will be later this year before significant recoupment claims are lodged with my Department. Full details in relation to the 2022 EERP will be available early in 2023.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are presently processing this payment.</p><p>In relation to the closure of this case, I can advise that a decision on the substitute consent application by ESB for their Derrybrien Wind Farm in County Galway was signed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board) on Friday 4 February 2022. </p><p>In their decision, the Board refused to grant substitute consent for ESB&rsquo;s wind farm, which ends the statutory process seeking to retrospectively regularise the environmental impact assessment status of the wind farm, (the subject matter of the EU court judgment in case C-261/18). </p><p>On 16 March 2022, ESB decided to cease operations at the Derrybrien wind farm permanently, and it is understood that ESB is preparing to decommission the wind farm in line with regulatory and legal requirements.</p><p>Planning legislation specifies that a development that has been refused substitute consent is deemed to be an &lsquo;unauthorised development&rsquo; development by primary legislation. Galway County Council, the relevant planning authority, is required to issue a planning enforcement notice in accordance with sections 154 and 177O(5) of the Planning and Development Act, which among other things shall require the cessation of activity on site.  </p><p>On 30 May 2022, officials in my Department wrote to the Commission, to seek to close out the related infringement case against Ireland on the basis of the Board&rsquo;s decision to refuse permission for the wind farm, which unauthorised development is now an enforcement matter for the relevant planning authority. Discussions with the Commission in this regard are ongoing. </p></reply>

In preparing these plans local authorities were asked to assess the level of housing demand with affordability constraint projected for their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) tool and plan their provision accordingly. Local authorities with an identified affordable housing need were asked to prepare Affordable Delivery Action Plans and were set five-year Affordable Delivery Targets.  </p>  <p>  An identified high level of affordable housing need arises where the HNDA indicates that, of the total projected need for housing in the county, over 5% of new households will not qualify for social housing but will also be constrained in accessing housing by their ability to afford to buy or rent. The level of affordably constrained need across both Cavan and Monaghan is assessed at below 5%, although some localised affordability issues may arise in certain towns within the county. </p>  <p>  It is possible for local authorities, including Monaghan County Council and Cavan County Council, to undertake HNDA analysis at sub county level to determine whether a need for affordable housing schemes is evident in specific towns/areas.  The Affordable Housing Fund subsidy is available to support affordable housing purchase in schemes located in large or key towns per National Planning Framework objectives and to  ensure that provision is aligned with where need is concentrated. My Department and the Housing Agency are available to assist in this regard. </p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme to support affordable purchases of new homes in the private market will operate nationwide. Targeted at First Time Buyers or those eligible under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle, the Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders, and was launched last week. It will improve access to newly-built homes by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. The homes must be priced within regional price ceilings which will reflect the median prices paid by First Time Buyers for new homes in each area, so this is an intervention to support homeownership in the lower region of the market.</p></reply>

These include a commitment to to examine defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report <i>&quot;Safe as Houses?&quot; </i>and to assist owners of latent defect properties, by identifying options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.  <i>Housing for All</i>, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates these commitments. </p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings have taken place to advance elements of the work.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013. The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p> <blockquote> 	1.  Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.<br /><br />2.  Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:<br /><br />-Identification and description of defect,<br /><br />-Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,<br /><br />-Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,<br /><br />-Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,<br /><br />-Period of construction affected,<br /><br />-Type of dwelling affected,<br /><br />-Location of dwellings affected.<br /><br />3.  Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.<br /><br />4.  Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.<br /><br />-In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.<br /><br />5.  Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:<br /><br />-Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,<br /><br />-Efficient means of carrying out work,<br /><br />-individual dwellings or whole building approach,<br /><br />-routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,<br /><br />-Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.<br /><br />6.  Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.<br /><br />7.  Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.<br /><br />8.  Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing. </blockquote>  <p>The working group is currently concluding its deliberations in support of the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and working towards finalisation of its report. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

Cork City Council has advised my Department that the first two phases of the Boherboy Road project in Cork City, involving a total of 117 affordable purchase homes, will see 37 of those homes completed and advertised for applications to purchase this month.  </p><p>In addition, a development at Cluain Chaoin in Tower will deliver 36 affordable purchase homes in two phases and will also be advertised this month. </p><p>Nationally, approval in principle has been confirmed for approximately 900 new Cost Rental homes to be delivered in urban centres by AHBs under the Cost Rental Equity Loan scheme over the period 2021-2023. Of these initial approvals, approximately 150 are scheduled to be delivered in Cork City in 2022 and 2023, across four different sites. The first 73 Cost Rental homes in Cork are scheduled for delivery by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Lancaster Gate, Cork City, later this year. </p><p>Furthermore, the Land Development Agency (LDA) are currently working on the former HSE site at St. Kevin&rsquo;s Hospital in Cork City. The LDA have secured planning permission for 265 social and affordable homes. Work will begin on site this year and the first homes are expected at the end of 2023.</p><p>The planned delivery of affordable housing, in accordance with the Affordable Housing Act 2021, is set out in local authorities' Housing Delivery Action Plans.Preparation of the Plans allowed each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly. They provide a comprehensive national overview of projected delivery of affordable housing.</p><p>Finally, the recently launched First Home Scheme to support affordable purchases of new homes in the private market will operate nationwide. Targeted at First Time Buyers or those eligible under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle, the Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders, and was launched last week. It will improve access to newly-built homes by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. The homes must be priced within regional price ceilings which will reflect the median prices paid by First Time Buyers for new homes in each area, so this is an intervention to support homeownership in the lower region of the market.</p></reply>

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. </p><p>Since HAP was rolled out in 2014 to end 2021, HAP support has been ceased for 1,418 tenancies due to tenant differential rent arrears. This represented 1.4% of all tenancies set up during that period. Data in respect of 2022 is not yet available. My Department does not hold data on the number of tenants who have exited HAP due to arrears on a county by county basis, the management of individual HAP tenancy exits is a matter for each individual local authority.</p><p>The approach taken by the HAP Shared Services Centre (HAP SSC) has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q4 2021, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.</p><p>During the Covid-19 emergency, the HAP Debt Management Process (DMP) was suspended from March 2020 and partially re-commenced in October 2020. This meant non-payment of differential rent by a tenant during that time did not affect payments to HAP landlords. Tenants were, however, expected to continue to pay their rent with supports available for those financially impacted by Covid.</p><p>Following on from the successful roll out of the Covid vaccine programme and the reopening of society, the normal DMP was reinstated from 6 September 2021.</p><p>Tenants that incurred arrears during the Covid-19 emergency were given additional time to engage with the HAP Debt Management Unit to clear their arrears, as well as access to payment plans as a specific Covid measure. Under the normal HAP DMP payment plans are not offered or available to tenants at this stage of the process. The HAP SSC has now resumed the standard debt management process.</p><p>The National Homeless Action Committee (NHAC), which I chair, was established in December 2021 in line with a commitment set out in <i>Housing for All</i>.  At the first meeting of NHAC, it was agreed that immediate priority would be given to additional measures to prevent homelessness. A number of measures have been identified and are now being advanced. Three separate subgroups have also been established to focus on specific areas of homelessness prevention. One of these subgroups is tasked with considering the risk of homelessness for HAP/HHAP tenants in arrears. </p><p>HAP tenants in arrears should contact their local authority and the HAP SSC to discuss the options that are available to them to ensure the continuation of their HAP support.</p></reply>

This includes delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p><p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes; 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026. In September 2021, I issued social housing targets to each local authority, for the period 2022-2026 and in March I issued local authority targets for affordable purchase and cost-rental. Louth County Council has a target to deliver 1,323 new build social homes in the period 2022-2026 including a target to deliver 660 new build social homes in 2022.</p><p>Specific to Affordable Housing Fund- supported homes, Louth County Council have a target to deliver 226 affordable purchase and cost-rental homes in the period 2022-2026. The First Home affordable purchase shared equity scheme is also available to purchasers in Louth.The Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) is available to Approved Housing Bodies and the scheme will deliver 34 Cost Rental homes in Louth in 2023. The Help to Buy Scheme, Local Authority Home Loan and the expanded Part V requirements are also available to increase the supply of new housing and make home ownership more affordable across Louth.</p><p>It is a matter for each local authority to determine the location of social and affordable housing projects, having regard to the identified need. A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery as appropriate over the period 2022 - 2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All. All local authorities submitted their Housing Delivery Action Plans to me in December and my Department worked closely with the local authorities to review and finalise the Plans, having regard to the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. The Plans are being published on local authority websites.  </p></reply>

The site investigations are critical activities developers undertake in order to investigate viability and prepare environmental impact assessments of potential future offshore renewable energy (ORE) infrastructure. The majority of these applications have been received in the last 12 months which is strong indication of the appetite and commercial interest in the developing ORE sector in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Foreshore Section of my Department also assesses foreshore consent applications for a range of other proposed activities and developments relating to ports and harbours, strategic infrastructure projects like water and waste water infrastructure, local authorities&rsquo; infrastructural works such as bridges, marinas, coastal protection works, flood relief works, as well as strategically important telecommunications and interconnector projects. </p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to prioritise site investigation licence applications linked to a set of seven qualified ORE projects, known as "relevant projects" or Phase 1 project, which qualify to make an application to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) as part of the transition provisions in the Marine Area Planning Act 2021. Any project in this category granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new marine planning system.</p>  <p>  Each application must be assessed appropriately in accordance with the applicable requirements of domestic and EU law including the EIA Directive, Birds and Habitats Regulations and the Foreshore Act. Over the last eighteen months, my Department has significantly increased its staffing resources in this area, including technical personnel available within the Foreshore Section to address this increasing workload of applications under the Foreshore Act. In parallel, the processes underpinning the statutory assessment processes have been refined allowing the various procedures to run in parallel, where appropriate. This should reduce the average time taken to assess an application. In addition, a panel of external specialist environmental consultants is in operation to assist in the technical assessment of applications. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that my Department is taking a proportionate and responsible approach to processing foreshore licence applications for site investigation licences linked to the proposed development of offshore renewable energy projects pending the update to policy in relation to the management of the Phase 2 for offshore renewable energy, as well as progress with the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority. I will continue to keep the situation under review.</p></reply>

The 2022 National Biodiversity Conference in June formed a key element of public and cross-sector outreach and the outputs from conference discussions have helped to inform further refinement of the Plan, which will be issued for public consultation in the coming months. </p>  <p>  The final draft of the Plan will be published in early 2023, to align with the outcomes of the Convention for Biological Diversity COP 15 and to allow the recommendations of the ongoing Citizens Assembly on Biodiversity Loss to be reviewed and incorporated, where appropriate. </p></reply>

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. There are several payments within the scheme, including once-off exceptional needs payments which can cover rent arrears.</p>  <p>Decisions regarding management of arrears are a matter for individual local authorities. Local authorities actively engage with tenants to ensure rent arrears do not arise in the first instance, including for those tenants on fixed incomes such as invalidity pension. Where arrears do arise the local authority will work with the tenant to put in place a repayment arrangement to assist the tenant in managing the arrears. This can include advising the tenant of the services offered by MABs. Local authority rent schemes also generally make allowances for specific hardship cases. In such cases, they may accept lesser amounts for a specified period if they consider the amount of rent due would cause undue hardship for the tenant.  </p></reply>

RAS has provided a more structured, accommodation-based approach to the use of the private rented sector to meet long-term housing need, thereby eliminating dependence on temporary income support payments through Rent Supplement. The scheme is delivered by local authorities who source accommodation from both the private market and Approved Housing Bodies. </p><p>In order for a household to qualify for HAP, they must first be assessed as eligible for social housing support by their local authority. Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for HAP and those households must source their own accommodation in the private rental sector.</p><p>HAP is replacing Rent Supplement for those with a long-term housing need who qualify for social housing support. However, Rent Supplement will remain available through the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to households as a short-term income support.</p><p>A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement specifically with a HAP recipient. However, on 1 January 2016, the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 introduced &ldquo;housing assistance&rdquo; as a new discriminatory ground. This means that discrimination in the provision of accommodation or related service and amenities against people in receipt of rent supplement, HAP or other social welfare payments is prohibited. Further information is available at <i>www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/housing/housing-assistance-payment/</i></p><p>If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission; further information is available on the Commission's website, <i>www.workplacerelations.ie/en/</i></p><p>Under the Housing for All strategy, the Government plans to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 homes per year over the next decade, including an average of 10,000 new build social homes.As new build supply of social housing ramps up, there will be reducing reliance on the HAP and RAS schemes.</p></reply>

In order for a household to qualify for HAP, they must first be assessed as eligible for social housing support by their local authority. Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for HAP and those households must source their own accommodation in the private rental sector.  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while the supply of social housing increases. </p><p>Under Housing for All, the Department was tasked with undertaking an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required.  The Housing Agency undertook to carry out this analytical exercise on behalf of the Department to better understand what level of discretion should be made available to Local Authorities under HAP to maintain adequate levels of support. </p><p>Following receipt and analysis of this review, I, in cooperation with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, have now approved an increase in the HAP discretion rate from 20% to 35% and for new tenancies to extend the couple&rsquo;s rate to single person households. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.  Both these measures came into effect from 11 July 2022. </p><p>Each local authority now has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 35% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it, or up to 50% in the case of homeless households in the Dublin region. </p><p>A separate review of the discretion available to Homeless HAP tenancies in Dublin, which is up to 50% above the prescribed maximum rent limits, is currently being undertaken by my Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency.</p><p>It is a matter for the local authority to determine, on a case by case basis, whether, and to what extent, the application of the flexibility is warranted although it should be noted that local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable.</p><p>From available data, at the end of Q4 2021, 57% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility, at an average rate of discretion of 24.2% above the relevant limit. </p><p>When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 51.2%, of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 17.3% above the relevant limit.</p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent required by the landlord, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and that households in HAP are in a position to meet the rental costs involved. </p><p>The supplementary welfare scheme and the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 come under the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>I am committed to decreasing our reliance on the HAP scheme and we will only do that through significantly scaling up our social housing supply. &lsquo;Housing for all&rsquo; sets us on a pathway to delivering 90,000 social homes between now and the end of 2030 including 9,000 this year.</p></reply>

Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p><p>Supporting documentation for the application to which the Deputy has referred was received on 7 October 2020, and is due to be processed in the near future. A member of the FBR team will be in contact with the applicant in this regard. </p><p>The Passport Service has been scaling up resources to deal with anticipated demand for passports and FBRs since June of last year. Over 570 staff have been assigned to the Passport Service since June 2021, including 200 who have started since May of this year.  </p><p>The unprecedented level of staff currently working in the Passport Service will be maintained in the months ahead. This will allow for the reassignment of additional staff to the processing of FBR applications with the aim of significantly reducing turnaround times for these applications by the end of this year.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, recent months have seen an increase in insecurity and violence in eastern DRC and a worrying escalation of tensions between the DRC and Rwanda. At the most recent discussion on the DRC at the UNSC on 29 June, Ireland specifically expressed concern at rising tensions and stressed the importance of regional efforts to address the crisis. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the efforts of the United Nations, through the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), to reduce violence and instability in DRC, both through our membership of the UNSC and our deployment of personnel to MONUSCO. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been a troop contributing country to MONUSCO, previously MONUC, since 2001. Additionally, Ireland provided &euro;4.9 million in humanitarian assistance to the DRC in 2021, and have committed a further &euro;4.4 million for humanitarian assistance and response in 2022. </p>  <p>  The European Union (EU) is currently actively engaged in the DRC and has encouraged the development of a strategic, political resolution to the conflict in eastern DRC.  Ireland has emphasised the importance of the engagement of national and regional organisations and actors to promote peace and stability in DRC and the wider Great Lakes Region, including as a member of UNSC and the EU. The DRC will be among the subjects to be discussed by EU Foreign Ministers when the next meet on 18 July. Ireland has welcomed the efforts of the East African Community Heads of State Conclave, including the Nairobi peace process, and the recent summit between the Presidents of DRC and Rwanda hosted by the International Conference on the Great Lakes (ICGLR) in Luanda, Angola.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to maintain that politicisation of instability must not be allowed to deepen the current crisis in eastern DRC. As a UNSC member, Ireland will steadfastly encourage efforts by regional and international partners to de-escalate tensions and build trust. Regional cooperation remains essential in the pursuit of peace and security, and Ireland will continue to highlight the importance of the ongoing implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the region, and to encourage constructive engagement in the Nairobi peace process and the implementation of the ICGLR Roadmap.</p></reply>

The witnessing of these forms is a vital element of the identity verification process for the Passport Service, as it provides initial assurance that the person in the photograph is the same person presenting to submit the passport application form. In the case of children's applications, it ensures that the consent of guardians is verified. </p>  <p>  Garda stations maintain logs of these witnessed forms for verification purposes. For each application involving a Garda witness, the Passport Service calls the relevant Garda station to confirm that the Garda witness recorded the witnessed form in the station logbook. Passport Service staff will call the relevant Garda station up to three times to verify the Garda's signature.</p>  <p>  In cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified by calling the Garda station, a new system has been established between the Passport Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to verify these applications. This new system assists in reducing the number of applications that are delayed due to a failure to verify witness details. An average of 15 applications per day are verified in this manner. Over the past four weeks, the Passport Service has issued over 6,000 passports per day. </p>  <p>  This system was fully rolled out across the Passport Service in June 2022. The Passport Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will keep the system under review to ensure that it continues to operate effectively.</p></reply>

This outreach is supplemented by our Embassies abroad and by senior officials across the civil service. Solidarity with Ireland&rsquo;s position and support for the Commission&rsquo;s approach and for minimising disruption in Northern Ireland remains steadfast among our EU partners.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spoke with Prime Minister Johnson on 10 May and engaged with representatives of the UK Government, the NI Executive, Scotland, Wales, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, and Jersey at the British-Irish Council Summit meeting in Guernsey on 8 July.  He is in ongoing contact with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel, and met with Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic on 7 June.</p>  <p>  I spoke on 13 June with European Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic about the UK Government&rsquo;s publication of draft legislation on the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.  I speak regularly with my EU counterparts including during my recent visits to Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Spain and Sweden, as well as in the margins of EU meetings such as the Foreign Affairs Council, and meetings in other international forums. On 3 July, in a joint article in the UK&rsquo;s Observer newspaper with German Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, we made clear our concerns about the UK&rsquo;s unilateral approach on the Protocol and set out a way forward based on partnership and vision.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Byrne also avails of the opportunities of meetings with his counterparts at the General Affairs Council and in capitals to reiterate our position and to thank them for their ongoing support.</p>  <p>  I am also in ongoing contact with my counterparts in the British Government, as well as with stakeholders in Northern Ireland. I spoke by phone to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on 13 June and expressed my deep disappointment at the UK&rsquo;s proposed illegal actions. Far from fixing the challenges arising from the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK&rsquo;s Northern Ireland Protocol Bill will create a whole new set of uncertainties and damage relationships within Northern Ireland, across our islands, between our governments, and between the UK and the EU and its Member States.  I spoke by phone to the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Shailesh Vara on 7 July and met with him in London on 11 July.</p>  <p>  The Government remains in regular contact with the US administration. I travelled to Washington D.C. at the end of April where I discussed the Protocol with senior members of the Biden administration, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. Minister of State Byrne travelled to the US for a series of engagements in June. I have welcomed a number of US Congressional Delegations to Ireland in recent months, including a bipartisan Congressional Delegation which visited Dublin and Kerry in May. We are grateful for continued bipartisan US support for peace and stability in NI throughout the Brexit process, and we will continue to ensure that the Irish perspective is understood through continued high-level contact, as well as through ongoing engagement by our Embassy in Washington, D.C. </p></reply>

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries.</p><p>There are currently seven recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, Serbia, Ukraine and Moldova. Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia are recognised as potential candidates by the EU. Georgia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have formally submitted applications for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and has indicated an intention to submit a formal application for EU membership during 2022. </p><p>On 17 June 2022, the European Commission presented its Opinions on the EU membership applications submitted by Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova as invited by the European Council. The Commission recommended that candidate status be granted to Ukraine and Moldova, on the understanding that reforms are taken in a number of areas. It was also recommended that candidate status eventually be granted to Georgia, once a number of priority reforms have been addressed, with the Commission to review progress on all three applications by the end of 2022. Ireland welcomed and supported the 23 June decision of the European Council to grant EU candidate status to Ukraine and to Moldova and potential candidate status to Georgia.</p><p>Ireland has long advocated for this outcome and I have strongly supported Ukraine's EU perspective at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council. As I re-iterated when I met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba in April, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU membership. President Zelenskyy also expressed his thanks for Ireland being in the leading group of countries supporting Ukraine&rsquo;s candidacy during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to Kyiv on 5-6 July. </p><p>We have come together with a group of other Member States with a view to providing political and practical assistance in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective. I and my officials have also had frequent meetings with representatives of the Ukrainian, Georgian and Moldovan authorities on the issue of EU membership, including with the Embassy teams of those countries here in Ireland. </p><p>In the Western Balkans, current issues relating to the enlargement process largely revolve around the commitment to opening Inter-Governmental Conferences (IGCs) with Albania and North Macedonia. The main obstacle to agreement has been Bulgaria&rsquo;s objection to moving ahead with opening accession negotiations with North Macedonia due to bilateral difficulties related to the Macedonian language, the Bulgarian community in North Macedonia, and the implementation of the 2017 Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations. </p><p>Diplomatic efforts led by the outgoing French Presidency have been underway in recent weeks to resolve the issues. On 24 June the Bulgarian Parliament approved a proposal from the French Presidency aimed at resolving the impasse and lifting the veto. Following further discussions, including <i>en marge</i>of the NATO Summit in Madrid on 29-30 June, the French Presidency produced a revised proposal which has been accepted by the North Macedonian government and submitted to the country&rsquo;s national assembly for consideration, with a parliamentary vote expected on 15 July. </p><p>The issue was discussed during the joint visit of the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, T.D., with his Finnish counterpart, Tytti Tuppurainen, to Skopje on 4 July with both Ministers emphasising that the latest Presidency proposal represented a clear opportunity for North Macedonia to advance on its European track while safeguarding both the Macedonian language and identity. </p><p>Elsewhere, the EU is continuing to encourage greater reform efforts on the part of Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in relation to Rule of Law and promotion of good governance. Serbia&rsquo;s non-alignment with the EU common position relating to Russia&rsquo;s aggression against Ukraine has also been of concern recently.  </p><p>The possibility of granting candidate status to Bosnia and Herzegovina was also discussed at the June European Council meeting. Ireland welcomes that the Commission will be providing a further report on the country&rsquo;s progress in meeting its reform agenda, and looks forward to supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina as it advances further on its European path. </p><p>Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.</p></reply>

Over 720,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022, compared to 634,000 in the whole of last year. </p><p>The Passport Service continues to outperform its previous busiest year, 2019, by over 20%. </p><p>The Passport Service is continually working to deliver enhanced customer experience and service delivery to our citizens. This year the Passport Service is experiencing an unprecedented volume of demand for passports. This is as a direct result of pent-up demand for travel after two years of pandemic-related restrictions.</p><p>This level of demand is not unique to Ireland. In countries such as the UK and United States, the turnaround time for all types of passports can be up to 10 weeks. The Passport Service has decreased the processing times for first time online applications by 40% since March. Processing time for first time online applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In addition, almost half of adult online renewals are processed within 2 days. The Passport Service is performing at its highest capacity ever and is producing an average of almost 6,000 passports per day.</p><p>The current processing times are:</p><p>- Online adult renewal - 10 working days</p><p>- Online child/complex renewal - 15 working days</p><p>- Online first time application - 25 working days (from 6 June)</p><p>- An Post Passport Service - 8 weeks</p><p>In order to achieve these type of results and to continue to improve the service, my Department has made an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service. In terms of staffing, over 570 staff have been assigned to the Passport Service since June of last year, including 200 since May 2022. The addition of these staff has allowed the Passport Service to maintain its current turnaround times in the face of enormous levels of demand.</p><p>In addition to significantly more staff being assigned, the Passport Service has made important improvements as follows that will help to ensure that passport applications can be processed within turnaround times:</p><p>- A large number of the new staff have been assigned to the Customer Service Hub. This has greatly increased the number of calls and webchats being answered and is assisting with customers getting access to the information they need. In recent weeks, the number of calls handled by the Hub has risen to over 2,000 per day.</p><p>- In May the Passport Service released two online video guides that provide tips to ensure that passport photos and witnessed consent forms for children are correctly submitted. Passport photos and witnessed consent forms are some of the main reasons that an application may be rejected, so it is important the customers have all the information they need to ensure that these are submitted correctly. These easy-to-follow video guides are available on my Department's website and social media channels and I encourage all applicants to watch them before they submit their application.</p><p>- The Passport Service has worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified.

In light of the deepening global food security crisis, we are actively engaged in discussions on these matters at a range of EU fora. We are particularly concerned at the situation in least developed, and import-reliant developing countries, including in the Horn of Africa. These countries are experiencing the compound impacts of COVID-19, climate change and conflict, and, now the devastating consequences of Russia&rsquo;s invasion.  </p><p>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s participation in the European Council on 23-24 June is a notable example of this engagement, along with our contributions to Council Conclusions for a Team Europe Global Food Security Response,<b></b>adopted at the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 June. EU Member States have agreed to combat Russian efforts to assign blame to EU/Western sanctions for the food crisis; reduce<i></i>the dependence of partner countries on grain imports; promote sustainable food systems; and to mobilise EU funding. Solidarity in facilitating exports from Ukraine was also highlighted, with support expressed for the proposed EU &lsquo;Solidarity Lanes&rsquo; that will facilitate the  release of 22 Million tonnes of grain trapped in Ukraine. </p><p>The EU has now committed &euro;5 billion in funding to support global food security over the next three years. This includes immediate measures through its Neighbourhood South Facility; the launch of a &euro;225 million &lsquo;Food and Resilience Facility&rsquo;;<i></i>a &euro;1 billion pledge in support of the Sahel and Lake Chad regions; and a pledge of over &euro;600 million for the Horn of Africa<i>.</i></p><p>Ireland is committed to an effective, rapid, and well-co-ordinated Team Europe response to the global food security crisis, and we will continue to play our part. Last year, we committed &euro;800 million to nutrition work over the next five years; we signed a three-year partnership with the World Food Programme for &euro;75 million; and, we increased our funding to the International Fund for Agricultural Development by 67%.</p></reply>

Rising global food prices have been exacerbated by the effective blockade on shipping from Ukraine's ports which has restricted access to wheat and fertilisers. The United Nation&rsquo;s outlook for the coming months highlights twenty global hunger hotspots where humanitarian action is an urgent priority. </p>  <p>  In its review of Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance (ODA) published in 2020, the OECD found Ireland to be an excellent humanitarian partner. Ireland is supporting responses worldwide including a strong focus on the 20 hunger hotspots and the 2022 allocation of &euro;126 million for Irish Aid&rsquo;s humanitarian action is substantially higher than 2021. In addition the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine has provided &euro;25 million to assist the World Food Programme&rsquo;s activities in crisis countries. In order to help address the underlying causes of food insecurity Ireland has pledged to invest &euro;800 million by 2027 in improving global food and nutrition systems.</p>  <p>  The Horn of Africa, to give one specific example of our response, is experiencing one of the most severe droughts in at least forty years. Responding, my Department has contributed over &euro;48 million in humanitarian support to Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia over the past 18 months. These interventions complement the Irish Aid investment of over &euro;12 million in development funding last year, including in partnership with Irish NGOs.</p>  <p>  In addition, the region is being supported through Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to multilateral humanitarian action, such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland prepositions funds with partners such as the CERF which enables them to react immediately to crises as they happen. Since 2021, the CERF has allocated almost $100 million to help drought-affected communities in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia. Ireland is the 8th largest contributor to CERF providing &euro;11.5 million in 2022. Ireland has supported a strong EU response and in April the EU pledged &euro;348 million for 2022 to provide both humanitarian assistance and longer-term support to tackle root causes of food insecurity.</p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council Ireland will continue to draw international attention to humanitarian crises. As the informal focal point on Conflict and Hunger on the Security Council, Ireland is a consistent advocate on global food insecurity. We are also a strong voice at the EU on collective action and the urgent need for scaled up responses.</p></reply>

The position is honorary and Honorary Consuls play an important role in delivering consular assistance and services to our citizens and in representing Ireland abroad.</p>  <p>  While the role and functions performed by Honorary Consuls can vary, they are generally appointed to provide consular services and assistance to Irish citizens in their area of accreditation. They act as a focal point for the local Irish community, particularly in countries where there is no resident Mission, and they assist with trade promotion and arrangements for high-level visits, in consultation with their supervising Mission, as well as promoting the increase of Ireland&rsquo;s visibility and profile.</p>  <p>  The Honorary Consulate in Cancun has been in place since August 2008, and the term of the current Honorary Consul there was recently renewed until August 2026.  The Government has no plans to upgrade the Honorary Consul in Cancun to a Consulate General office. The Embassy team in Mexico City manages Ireland&rsquo;s relations with Mexico. It is considering appointing new Honorary Consuls in the coming months in the cities of Guadalajara and Monterrey, and has invited suitable candidates to submit expressions of interest.</p>  <p>  The Governments Global Ireland programme aims to see Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint and influence double in the period to 2025, including through an expanded and strengthened diplomatic presence.  Since its launch in June 2018, 14 new Missions have been opened, including, in 2021, in Kyiv, Manchester, Manila and Rabat.  A Government decision in 2021 approved the opening of a further four new Missions in Dakar, Lyon, Miami and Toronto.  Along with the reopening of our Embassy in Tehran, this will bring to 19 the number of new Missions opened as a key deliverable of 'Global Ireland' . </p>  <p>  All Missions are located in regions where there are opportunities for Ireland to advance our national, political and economic priorities.  Missions work as part of an integrated Team Ireland in cooperation with State Agencies and other Government Departments, to strengthen Ireland's international reputation and drive the development of opportunities in trade, tourism, investment, science, technology and innovation, culture and education.</p></reply>

The House of Commons have voted for the Bill to pass through its remaining stages, and the Bill will now go to the House of Lords for First Reading, though the date for this is not yet confirmed. </p>  <p>  It is deeply disappointing that the British Government has chosen to unilaterally introduce legislation, moving away from the process agreed in the Stormont House Agreement -a process that was agreed by both Governments and the majority of the political parties in Northern Ireland.  We have consistently maintained that any way forward on legacy must be based on a collective approach and a broad measure of consensus, with victims at its centre.</p>  <p>  I met the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Shailesh Vara MP in London on Monday 11 July, following a phone call immediately upon his appointment. We discussed a broad range of issues including legacy, and I raised our serious concerns regarding this legacy Bill. I urged the Secretary of State against moving forward with unilateral action in this deeply sensitive space, and against taking an approach that does not have the support of victims or any political party in Northern Ireland. I will continue to remain in close contact with the Secretary of State, and our officials will also continue to engage on this issue, to communicate the profound concerns and upset  being expressed by victims and their families.</p>  <p>  I have also outlined our significant concerns by writing to the British Government in some detail. They include, but are not limited to, the status of the &lsquo;reviews&rsquo; proposed in the Bill, serious questions around the independence of the proposed process and of course, fundamentally, compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and other international human rights obligations. </p>  <p>  The Government is firmly committed to making progress on this issue for the families and victims that have been waiting for too long for truth and justice, and will continue to engage with the British Government to make clear our serious concerns and urge them to reconsider their approach. </p></reply>

The combined effective strength of the AR and NSR, at year end, for the past five years is set out below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>AR &amp;amp; NSR Effective Personnel (at year end)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>1,489</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>1,588</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>1,673</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>1,799</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>1,856</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The strength of the First Line Reserve, at year end, for the same period is as follows. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>FLR Personnel (at year end)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>271</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>262</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>272</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>288</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>271</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Government remains committed to on-going recruitment in the RDF. I am very cognisant of the fact that the RDF strength level remains lower than the Establishment figure. However, I am aware of the many initiatives in place to recruit individuals to the Reserve. These include supports provided to maximise RDF recruitment, including use of social media, promotion through the DF Press Office, outreach activities by RDF members, and the use of PDF exit interviews which contain information on applying to the RDF. In addition, I'm advised by the Military Authorities that a number of measures to streamline recruitment and induction process for the RDF are in train and it is hoped that they will yield a positive outcome.</p><p>While the commitment to restoring the strength of the RDF is not in doubt, the same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment. Given the competing recruitment demands at present, PDF recruitment is, and will remain a priority.  However, RDF recruitment will continue to be progressed to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>Heretofore, there was no provision in the Defence Acts to allow RDF personnel to be deployed overseas. However, the Defence (Amendment) Act 2021 has been signed into law, which serves to update the Defence Legislation on the use of the RDF on a voluntary basis, on-island and overseas in support of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, published last February, contains many detailed recommendations, including on the future structure and role of the RDF. As the Deputy will also be aware, following Tuesday&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting, I announced that the Government has approved a move to &lsquo;Level of Ambition 2&rsquo; (LOA2), as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission on the Defence Forces.</p><p>This will result in the Defence budget rising from &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion, in 2022 prices, by 2028, the largest increase in Defence funding in the history of the State. This will allow for the required substantial transformation and investment in recruitment and equipment that were identified by the Commission. </p><p>A High Level Action Plan (HLAP) that sets out the Government&rsquo;s response to the recent report of the Commission on the Defence Forces has also been approved.  </p><p>Some specific initiatives include the immediate commencement of planning for the establishment of an Office of Reserve Affairs with the priority objective of developing a regeneration plan for the Reserve Defence Force.</p></reply>

The Report was accepted in full by the Government and an extensive High Level Plan titled "Strengthening our Defence Forces&rdquo; was also agreed and published on the same date.</p>  <p>  All projects undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the PSPC report have now been completed, and/or are being progressed as part of normal business. The Project Management Office (PMO) has been stood down. This was communicated by a civil/military team in a final briefing on the status of the HLIP projects, to which the representative organisations of the Permanent Defence Force were invited.</p>  <p>  By way of an update on the status of the projects, four projects, relating to pay provided immediate benefits to PDF members totalling some &euro;10m, as well as initiatives that have led to further improvements. Also completed are projects on enhanced professional military education, bespoke leadership training, development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy, non-pay retention measures, consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas, a review of recruitment process and a review of technical pay groups.  The first tranche of payments to the Permanent Defence Force personnel who fulfil the eligibility criteria under the Technical pay grades 2-6 review, were received on the 13 July 2022.</p>  <p>  The Workforce Planning Project report has been presented and is being progressed through the joint civil/military Strategic Human Resources Group.</p>  <p>  The Review of Pay Structures project was intended to examine pay structures in the Permanent Defence Force and to fall under the public service pay agreement &ldquo;Building Momentum&rdquo;. However, in the intervening period, one of the tasks set for the Commission on the Defence Forces was also to examine pay structures in the Permanent Defence Force. The recommendations of another project dealing with incentivised long service arrangements for certain Officer and NCO ranks, fell to be considered in the context of the sectoral bargaining element of &ldquo;Building Momentum&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The project examining Barriers to Extended Participation in the PDF was split into two phases. Phase 1 focussed on reviewing mandatory retirement ages for Officers.  A review has been completed by civil and military staff and their Report contains a number of recommendations for extension in service limits. </p>  <p>  Phase 2 examined the contracts of service and mandatory retirement ages for enlisted personnel. In December 2021, agreement was secured with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which will allow for an extension in service limits for all Privates and Corporals to remain in service up to 50 years of age, subject to them meeting certain criteria including medical and fitness standards.</p>  <p>  Arrangements  were also secured which will allow for Sergeants to continue to serve  beyond 50 years of age the details of which will be finalised following  further discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p>  <p>  Other recommendations in this project (both Phase 1 and Phase 2) will be considered in the forum of an Inter-Departmental Working Group, which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established to consider mandatory retirement ages for all public service groups with fast accrual pension arrangements.</p></reply>

Rather, the Commission recommended that Defence Forces allowances, which were retained under Haddington Road Agreement but reduced above and beyond any reductions made under FEMPI, have their reductions restored. Given that the Specialised Instructors Allowance for Officers was abolished, rather than reduced, it was not encompassed by any recommendation of the Commission.</p><p>In 2017 RACO submitted a claim to Conciliation and Arbitration Council of the C&amp;amp;A Scheme seeking reinstatement of the Specialist Instructors Allowance for officers.  As the claim was a cost increasing measure, under the terms of the pay agreement of the day - the Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020 - the claim was not considered.  </p><p>There was scope in the context of the current pay agreement - &quot;Building Momentum - A New Public Service Pay Agreement 2021 -2022&quot;, to which RACO signed up, to have the matter of the restoration of the Specialist Instructors Allowance considered under the sectoral bargaining element of that fund. RACO members chose not to take that option however, instead deciding to utilise the fund for a general round of pay increases.</p><p>RACO has since reinstated its claim for reinstatement of the Allowance, and the matter is currently being processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  As discussions in the scheme are confidential to the parties concerned, I am constrained on commenting further, at this juncture.</p></reply>

The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, is the primary authority responsible for cyber security in the State, including incident response, cyber resilience and information provision.   </p>  <p>  While the primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to Cyber Security relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. This is being done in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognising the potential and important role of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department and members of the Defence Forces work closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and other Government Departments and Agencies to support measures to deal with cyber challenges.  A member of the Defence Forces is also currently seconded to the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia. The Centre is staffed and financed by 34 different countries. It is involved in carrying out cyber-defence focused training, awareness campaigns, workshops, and courses, developing and conducting cyber defence-focused exercises and developing its ability to provide cyber defence exercise support, providing a link between small and medium enterprises in the sector and governments, and developing its capability in cyber defence testing and validation. Having a member of the Defence Forces in the Centre of Excellence means we get important insight into developing trends in cyber security and it strengthens the ability of the State to respond to such threats.  </p>  <p>  The Dail very recently gave approval to join the PESCO project known as the Cyber Threats and Incident Response Information Sharing Platform. This project aims to strengthen EU Member States&rsquo; cyber defence capabilities and response to cyber incidents by promoting cooperation in the field of cyber threat information sharing. Ireland also participates in projects in the European Defence Agency which aim to maintain and improve cyber resilience as well as the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of EU Member States' Defence Forces personnel in the area of cyber defence.</p>  <p>  While it would be inappropriate, from an operational perspective, to comment on the Cyber capability of the Defence Forces other than to say that there is on-going development of cyber capabilities within the Defence Forces, on 12July Government approval was given for a move to &lsquo;Level of Ambition 2&rsquo; (LOA2), as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission on the Defence Forces. The Government also approved the High Level Action Plan, which sets out the response of Government in relation to each of the 130 specific recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s report. LOA2 includes a number of cyber-related measures such as deepening Defence Forces involvement in relevant national and international forums to enhance capability development in the cyber domain. Among the early actions identified in the High Level Action Plan, a detailed implementation plan will be published before the end of 2022, which will set out the recommendations to be delivered over the short, medium and long term. </p></reply>

These external gate posts are the primary means of access for aviation fuel supplies, aircraft and airport supplies, and construction and hangar personnel.  As well as access control and ID checks, screening at the gate posts includes searches of vehicles, baggage and people by hand and through the use of explosive trace detection.</p>  <p>  Defence Forces personnel have commenced training and have been certified to perform these duties. Training of personnel is continuing this week and the Defence Forces will stand ready to assist if required.

This assistance has not yet been requested by daa.</p>  <p>  The support will be stood down in August when the busy holiday period has passed. The daa have given assurances that they will continue with their own recruitment and onboarding of additional security staff and the introduction of other mitigations during this period.</p>  <p>  A service level agreement has been signed between the Department of Defence and the daa setting out the arrangements for the provision of aviation security duties by the Defence Forces at Dublin Airport. This includes the modalities for the reimbursement to the Exchequer of all costs by the daa, including salary costs, allowances, training, certification and management costs and the cost of having the Defence Forces personnel on standby. The service level agreement was signed following detailed discussions between officials from my Department, the Defence Forces, Department of Transport and daa to agree the necessary arrangements, and my Department will continue to liaise with all parties as required in this regard.</p></reply>

The equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) were restored at both Primary and Post-Primary level (2,600 in total).</p>  <p>  The Department has committed to annually revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year which has ensured that the current level of Posts of Responsibility (PORs) are maintained in the school system. New POR threshold tables are produced each year to distribute these POR&rsquo;s equitably across all school.</p>  <p>  Currently one in three teachers hold a promotional post within our schools.</p>  <p>  The Sectoral Bargaining process under Building Momentum for the primary sector has been used to increase posts of responsibility (POR) in primary and special schools by 1,450 posts. The distribution of these additional posts of responsibility are comprehended in Circular 0043/2022 - Allocation of Assistant Principal Posts 2022/2023 which issued last month.</p>  <p>  Since the commencement of the restoration of these posts at Post-Primary, there has also been an increased allocation in respect to Deputy Principal posts with over 450 additional posts allocated to schools. In the 2021/22 school year, the enrolment threshold for the allocation of an additional deputy principal in DEIS post-primary schools was reduced from 700 to 600 pupils. These additional posts provide resources to focus on leadership and management in our schools.</p>  <p>  This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  The current annual rates for Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II posts are &euro;9,058 and &euro;4,007 respectively.</p></reply>

In line with last year, the total funding available to provide summer programmes this year is up to &euro;40 million. Building on the 2021 programme, all schools, both primary and post-primary, are encouraged to provide this valuable programme to their students. In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.</p><p>The Department has held consultations and listened to education partners, stakeholders and advocacy groups. Following this process, steps have been taken to encourage more schools to participate including the following: </p><p>-  the provision of paid overseeing and preparation time for schools, </p><p>-  a reduction in the administrative burden for schools, </p><p>-  arrangements to pay staff sooner, </p><p>-  greater guidance, </p><p>-  an online payments portal for schools, and </p><p>-  greater flexibility in the timing of the programme.</p><p>The complexities of organising a summer programme in special school environments is recognised and further enhanced funding for special schools is being provided this year including increased capitation and preparation hours to support these schools.</p><p>Concerns around the availability of staff have been further addressed with the provision to recruit final year student teachers and student teachers registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5. To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, principals may delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. Overseers, teachers and SNAs who work on the programme will be paid for this work based on what they are normally paid during the school year in addition to their normal salary.</p><p>In 2021, 377 special schools and schools with special classes ran a programme, with in the region of 5,587 pupils attending. To provide some context, in 2011 there were 149 schools and 2,461 pupils attending the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; programme. The number of special schools running a programme under the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; scheme had fallen from 54 in 2011 to 34 in 2019. It is important to note that we have actually seen an increase in the number of special schools running a programme in both 2020 and 2021 with 39 special schools taking part in 2021.</p><p>While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.  </p><p>Planning for the 2023 Summer Programme has commenced with a view to addressing future plans for the programme.</p></reply>

Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements.</p>  <p>  An online registration portal was available for schools to register their participation in this year&rsquo;s programme with a closing date of 9 June, 2022. It remains open for schools to contact the Department in respect of the Summer Programme. Indications are that over 1,000 schools will participate in this year's programme compared to 945 in 2021. Final details of participating schools will be available later in the Summer.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists, but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Where reasonable progress is not made, following a school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, a psychologist will become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p></reply>

I am fully aware of the vitally important role played by them in the running of our schools and I support fully this important agreement which will improve their terms and conditions.</p>  <p>  The majority of primary and post-primary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union had tabled a claim in 2019 seeking parity of these staff with ETB public service staff. Extensive engagement has taken place since then between the Department and school management bodies with Forsa to work towards a resolution with the support of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  On the 24th February this year, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a suite of measures designed to improve the working conditions of school secretaries was proposed, which F&oacute;rsa agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot was undertaken and the result was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.  I was very pleased to hear of this overwhelmingly positive result on this long running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment.</p>  <p>  The work to implement this agreement has now commenced in conjunction with F&oacute;rsa; it requires a complex process of assimilating information to capture accurate data in respect of each individual secretary. Additional resources are in place to provide capacity to manage this process, ensuring both individual and school data is captured and correctly applied.</p>  <p>  This will also require the development of an IT system to collect the data and action the payroll obligations.  As this work is currently ongoing, it is therefore not possible to commit to an exact timeline but the Department has expedited the process and will communicate further as the work progresses.  </p>  <p>  The Department has issued a circular (36/2022) to schools outlining how the agreement will be implemented. The circular outlines that as a first phase of implementation of the agreement, schools must, before the end of September, calculate the initial assimilation rate of pay and annual leave entitlement for secretaries and offer it to secretaries.</p>  <p>  Should the secretary choose to move to the new terms then the new pay rate should be applied by the school from 1 September 2022.</p>  <p>  The verification of this first phase, the calculation of back pay and the option to have the value of Jobseekers Benefit included in pay will be addressed in the second phase of the assimilation process. The Department will continue to consider the approach to these further aspects and communicate to schools and secretaries as needed over the coming months.</p></reply>

Only "iron on" or "sew on" crests should be used. </p>  <p>  The Circular also sets out that schools should consult with parents on their views and suggestions on cost reduction initiatives in relation to school uniforms.</p>  <p>  The Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill, when enacted, will improve how schools engage with students and their parents by requiring each school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities, including school costs. This will help ensure that the various views of students and parents will be heard and responded to by schools.</p>  <p>  My Department recently announced a suite of measures designed to help families with school-going children returning to school in September which includes the non- charging of fees for school bus tickets which will provide families with savings of up to &euro; 500.00 on the costs of tickets.</p>  <p>  In addition, funding is provided to all recognised schools in the Free Education Scheme by way of per capita grants. The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.</p>  <p>  My Department has ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie. </p>  <p>  My Department has also provided funding of &euro;17.2 million in 2021 to schools in the free education scheme to provide assistance for books including Book Rental Schemes. The School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes the Approximately 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme. </p></reply>

The next step is the finalising of contracts and the commencement of referrals to the new service. Pending this, my Department has extended the contracts of most LES and Job Clubs until the end of August.  However, a small number of providers have declined the extension offer, which is at their discretion, and they will have communicated their decision and rationale to their staff.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where existing providers chose not to bid for the new services or were unsuccessful then I would expect that, as a first option, providers should look to redeploy any staff affected to other functions within their organisations.  However, where this is not possible, and if these employers are unable to finance redundancy payments, then my Department's Redundancy and Insolvency service will, in accordance with relevant legislation, be able to make provision for statutory redundancy payments for any affected staff.</p></reply>

This latest change means that a further 920 participants who would have been impacted by the rule, can remain on the scheme until they reach state pension age, as long as they continue to satisfy the eligibility requirements. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the review of the RSS scheme no longer needs to consider the operation of the 6-year rule.  Minister Humphreys and I have asked the Department in consultation with other relevant Departments, to look at where operational responsibility and funding for employment schemes and RSS, which are increasingly focused on providing services in local communities, should be best placed.  While this somewhat changes the context in which the RSS review will take place - the intention is to still review specific issues that relate to this scheme.  This work has not yet commenced, but it is intended that it will do so during the later months of this year.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the unemployment rate for June stood at 4.8 percent, around pre-pandemic levels.  </p>  <p>  Despite the significant improvement in the labour market, I am conscious that there are some people trying to regain their footing post-Covid and, as such, my Department continues to provide a range of supports for jobseekers. </p>  <p>  My Department, which delivers public employment services (PES) through Intreo and its contracted partners, offers a range of employment supports to help people prepare for and secure employment.  The key service provided is one-on-one engagements where a range of different options are explored, and a personal progression plan is agreed.  These plans can include referrals to employment opportunities, training, work placement, education, or support with self-employment or participation in state employment schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s.  In the last year, the caseload capacity of the PES is being expanded to provided additional capacity to help and support jobseekers. </p>  <p>  My Department offers work placement schemes such as the Workplace Experience Programme (WPEP), which can help break the cycle of &lsquo;no work, no experience&rsquo; and &lsquo;no experience, no work&rsquo; that often puts people at risk of long-term unemployment.</p>  <p>  Another part of our toolkit is providing recruitment subsidies such as JobsPlus, which offers a financial incentive of up to &euro;10,000 to employers who hire somebody who is long-term unemployed or who are older workers, lone parents and refugees. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022 and Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science provided for an additional 50,000 further education and training places to help more people to have the opportunity to upskill for employment into a new sector. </p>  <p>  State employment schemes such as Community Employment and T&uacute;s, play a crucial role in providing local services around the country and I have recently improved some of the conditions on these schemes to make them more accessible to jobseekers.  My Department also supports jobseekers wishing to become self-employed through the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance.</p>  <p>  These range of schemes and supports are vital to ensuring that jobseekers are given the best possible opportunity to find and sustain employment.</p></reply>

In 2019 my Department commissioned an independent review of the provision of employment advisory services, including JobPath, Local Employment Services and Job Clubs.  This review conducted by the Institute of Employment Studies and Social Finance, reviewed the provision of services and made recommendations for the future restructuring and procurement of services.  The consultants commissioned by the Department consulted independently with a sample of existing providers that they had selected.  </p>  <p>  All external providers of employment advisory services are subject to regular audits and inspections.  In addition, and specific to the provision of JobPath services, my Department commissions regular independent Customer Satisfaction Surveys to ensure that services are being delivered satisfactorily from the viewpoint of the customer.  All of the evidence indicates that the experience of the majority of customers who have engaged with the JobPath service to date has been quite positive. </p>  <p>  The Department have published the results of a number of these independent Customer Satisfaction Survey that have been commissioned since 2016.  These surveys are available on the Department&rsquo;s website on Gov.ie.  These surveys provide a qualitative evaluation of the standard of service provided by the JobPath contractors.  The most recent published survey would be that which was carried out in Dec 2021 and the results of this are published on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  In addition to the independently commissioned Customer Satisfaction Survey, the 2019 econometric review of JobPath undertaken by my Department in partnership with the OECD noted that the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment with the JobPath service are 17% higher than the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment without the support of JobPath in 2018.  Taken with the 26% improvement in employment outcomes in the same period, it means the overall positive employment/earnings impact is 37% in 2018 for those supported by the JobPath service.  These findings indicate that jobseekers who engage with JobPath are significantly more likely to get a positive employment outcome than those not supported by the service.  The evidence to date, published by the Department indicates that employment outcomes among people on JobPath are higher than non-participants. </p>  <p>  I would also refer the Deputy to the published C&amp;AG Report, which provides a detailed description of the JobPath service along with analysis and commentary on the service.  The Chapter on the JobPath Service is available on the C&amp;AG website. </p></reply>

This advance process facilitates an efficient service to these customers and allows for speedy processing of their claim when the period of unemployment actually arises.</p><p>However, it is important to note that educational sector workers are still required to sign on for each period of unemployment and satisfy all the qualifying conditions for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit including the 3 waiting days at the start of the claim if  it does not link to a previous jobseeker's claim. </p><p>I want to assure the Deputy that prompt processing of all claims remains a priority for my Department.

The changes will provide an enhanced appeals service to customers as well as supporting improved administrative arrangements.</p>  <p>  Insofar as oral hearings are concerned, the revised Regulations maintain the principle that it is at the discretion of the Appeals Officer as to whether a summary decision is made or an oral hearing is required. The revised Regulations also introduce a requirement on Appeals Officers to consult with a Deputy Chief Appeals Officer on the need for an oral hearing.</p>  <p>  Oral hearings have been successfully conducted online or by telephone since October 2020 and these types of hearings will continue.  This remote hearing approach has proven to be an effective way of facilitating an oral hearing previously achieved via the holding of an in-person hearing.  </p></reply>

It recommended that long-term carers should be given access to the State Pension (Contributory) by having retrospective contributions paid for them by the Exchequer for any gaps in their contribution history arising from that caring.  The Commission also recommended that relevant Departments should examine, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, options for the creation of a statutory "Family Carer Register" which could, in time, facilitate the identification of long-term carers for State Pension (Contributory) purposes as well as assisting in the planning and delivery of services for family carers.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the comprehensive and far-reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report need to be considered very carefully and holistically. My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will be considered as part of these deliberations.  Once we have considered all of these matters in detail and taken on board the views of my Ministerial colleagues, I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises.</p><p>The means test not only ensures that the recipient has an income need but also that scarce resources are targeted to those with the greatest need. Removing the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance would, in effect, create a new universal social protection scheme for those meeting the scheme&rsquo;s basic caring condition. </p><p>In Budget 2022, I announced significant improvements to the means test for Carer's Allowance, in recognition of the vital role that carers play in society. These were the first changes to the means test in 14 years.</p><p>-  The capital and savings disregard for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means assessment was increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which applies for DisabilityAllowance.</p><p>-  The weekly income disregard was increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p><p>The changes outlined came into effect on 2 June and many carers who, up to now, did not qualify for a payment due to means will now be brought into the Carer's Allowance system for the first time.  </p><p>Any additional changes to the Carer's Allowance means test would have to be considered in an overall policy and Budgetary context.</p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It does not reflect claims that were withdrawn, cancelled or awaiting further information.</p><p>Table 2 shows the number of Additional Needs Payment applications registered by county from March 2022 to June 2022 and the outcomes of these applications in terms of awards and disallows. It does not reflect claims that were withdrawn, cancelled or awaiting further information.</p><p>Table 3 shows the number of Rent Supplement recipients by county at the end of each month for the period 1st March to-date for 2022 (end of June). The number of applications received/awarded/disallowed for Rent Supplement is not currently available.</p><p>Table 4 shows the provisional monthly expenditure by county for Basic SWA, Rent Supplement and Additional Needs Payments from 1st March 2022 to end of June 2022.  A breakdown of expenditure by Intreo Centre or county is not available.</p><p>The claim figures in the tables below represent a snapshot of claim activity taken at 1st July 2022 and are subject to change.</p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place - 0818-607080 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>TABLE 1 &ndash;

The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. </p><p>In 2013, the arrangements governing the electricity/gas allowance were changed from a unit-based allowance to a credit-based allowance. The new monthly allowance was set at &euro;35 per month per customer and there has been no change to the monthly allowance rate since then.</p><p>If the increases outlined in the question were introduced in 2023, the estimated average number of recipients would be 495,000 and the additional yearly cost of the measures would be as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Proposed Monthly Rate Increase</th>       <th>New Monthly Rate</th>       <th>Number of Recipients</th>       <th>Additional Yearly cost</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;7 </td>       <td>&euro;42 </td>       <td>495,000 </td>       <td>&euro;41.6m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Any decision to enhance or increase the electricity and gas aspect of the package would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Entitlement to such schemes is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria. Illness Benefit and Invalidity Pension are two such non means tested income supports. </p>  <p>  Illness Benefit: is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness, who have made the necessary PRSI contributions. Certification for the scheme is by the persons treating physician, in most cases a General Practitioner.</p>  <p>  Invalidity Pension is a social insurance payment for people who are deemed permanently incapable of work due to a long-term illness or disability. Eligibility is subject to a medical assessment and PRSI contribution conditionality.  </p>  <p>  A person who has an insufficient PRSI contribution record may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme (Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension are both social assistance schemes). </p>  <p>  Disability Allowance: is designed to support people with a disability who are aged between 16 and 66, who are habitually resident in the state. Eligibility for Disability Allowance requires that the disability must be expected to last for at least one year, substantially restricting a person&rsquo;s ability to undertake work which would otherwise be suitable for persons of similar age, experience, and qualification.</p>  <p>  Blind Pension: is designed to support blind people/people with a specified level of low vision, aged 18 and up to the age of 66 who are habitually resident in the State. Eligibility for the Blind Pension requires that a person&rsquo;s vision is impaired to such an extent that they cannot perform any work for which eyesight is essential or cannot continue in their ordinary occupation. Medical assessment requirements include a medical report from an Ophthalmic Surgeon or an Optometrist.</p>  <p>  In addition to other conditions of a particular scheme (e.g. PRSI contributions, age, means) each application for the above schemes are individually assessed, based on the medical information provided by healthcare providers and the claimant.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note, that each of these schemes have been designed to support a person to enter, return to or retain employment. This is achieved through the provision of: employment supports and grants (available through Intreo), the Partial Capacity Benefit scheme and income disregards for income from employment / self-employment (where means are assessed as part of the eligibility criteria for a given scheme).</p></reply>

Where a person is in employment and does not engage in agreeing a repayment plan, the Department will consider making an attachment of earnings order.</p>  <p>  I would urge the person concerned to contact my Department's Central Debt Unit in order to discuss and agree a suitable repayment arrangement.  She can do this by emailing CentralDebt@welfare.ie or by calling 0818 927 999.     </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

This represents a snapshot of claim activity taken at 1st July and is subject to change.</p><p>Table 2 shows the expenditure for additional needs payments by month to-date in 2022 (to end of June). Breakdown of expenditure by county is not available.</p><p>Under the additional needs payments, which can have a wide range value, the amount paid will depend on a person&rsquo;s weekly household income, their outgoings and the type of assistance needed.  Payments are made for large items, such as help provided in setting up a home for the first time and smaller weekly supplements to assist with ongoing costs. The scheme is demand led. There is no maximum amount awarded and no cap on payment amount allowable; however the system is restricted to issuing payment transactions of &euro;6,500 or less per transaction. If an Officer determines that the need exceeds &euro;6,500 they can issue multiple payments of &euro;6,500 to meet the need presented. Statistics are not maintained on individual payment amounts or the salary levels of persons awarded an additional needs payment.</p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place - 0818-607080 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>TABLE 1 - Number of Additional Needs Payment claims processed by county for each month to-date in 2022 (to end of

Detailed information on claims awarded, claims rejected, claims withdrawn and total claims registered are available in the Annual Statistics report at www.gov.ie/dsp/statistics.</p><p>Claims awarded on appeal are managed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office which functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements. </p><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers and Designated Persons are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and approximately 2% are appealed. </p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was incorrect.  It is often the case that new evidence is provided with an appeal and that, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.</p><p>Where the decision was not revised by the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the person concerned as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the person concerned in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>The table below shows the outcome of appeals finalised for each benefit scheme in the last full calendar year (2021).</p><p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that these statistics are not maintained on a county by county basis, and it is not in a position to supply the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the specific county

Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the Fostering Allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised Fostering Allowance. Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager. </p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  Tusla has also advised in cases where access visits result in round trips in excess of 150km, an additional financial support payment may be made. Tusla has further advised an additional financial support payment may also be considered where a foster carer must, for reasons set out in child/young person&rsquo;s care plan, facilitate travel in excess of 300km per week cumulatively.</p>  <p>  I would like to acknowledge the fact that foster carers are the backbone of our child care services. It is vital that our foster care system operates as effectively as possible, for the foster carers and for the children in their care. </p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. When the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. </p>  <p>  Any decision to review the current allowances shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it. </p></reply>

Funding for the campaign was secured under the Dormant Accounts Initiative, and I secured in Budget 2022 to promote awareness around the UNCRPD. </p>  <p>  Engagement with stakeholders on the parameters of the campaign, the key messages to be communicated, and the media to be utilised in delivering it, will inform the final cost, and preparatory work is ongoing in this regard.</p>  <p>  In terms of action to date my Department already supports an employer outreach programme. My Department has provided funding to the Open Doors Initiative to deliver the &lsquo;Employers for Change&rsquo; project since 2020. The project comprises a website with information and a helpline through which information and advice can be sought, along with capacity building programmes delivered to employers and prospective employers of people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Employers for Change provides information to employers directly to address concerns that they may have about the ability of individuals with disabilities to carry out a job or their capacity as employers to support people with disabilities in the workplace. The fear of making mistakes can act as a significant barrier to employers and the Employers for Change project had demonstrated successfully that increased knowledge, awareness and understanding addresses such barriers well. </p></reply>

As part of the implementation of Phase 1 of the National Action Plan for Childminding, Budget 2022 enabled the recruitment of an additional 6 Childminding Development Officer posts within the CCCs as well as a national CCC Childminding Lead whose work includes overseeing and coordinating the team of 12 Childminding Development Officers. As the Childminding Development Officers work on a regional basis in collaboration with the CCCs in each region, the team of Childminding Development Officers provides full national coverage.  </p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the National Action Plan for Childminding, the role of the Childminding Development Officers is to prepare the childminding sector for the move towards wider regulation and support, while also in the immediate term supporting childminders who are subject to the current regulations but are not yet registered with Tusla to meet Tusla registration requirements, thus enabling more childminders to take part in the National Childcare Scheme and other State supports.</p>  <p>  The full-year cost of the 12 Childminding Development Officer posts that are now in place is &euro;843,000 per annum, which includes costs for salaries, PRSI, travel and subsistence and overheads.</p>  <p>  The Childminding Development Officers are employed by the City/County Childcare Committees, and the costs of each post vary between counties. On average, 78% of the costs of the posts are accounted for by salary and employment costs, 9% by travel and subsistence, and 13% by overheads. Assuming that the average cost of employing a single Childminding Development Officer, including all related employment costs as well as overheads, is approximately &euro;70,000 per annum, the additional cost of employing 15 full-time Childminding Development Officers would be approximately &euro;1 million per annum.</p></reply>

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.  </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.</p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.  </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. </p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. When the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it. </p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review. </p></reply>

Prevention and early intervention is cost effective. High quality, evidence informed prevention and early intervention services can help to address difficulties such as early school leaving and behavioural problems. </p>  <p>  Integrated, high-quality services to children and families must be provided at the earliest opportunity across all levels of need. Tusla family support services are delivered on the basis of low, medium, or high prevention. Tusla is working to embed and develop a consistent national approach to practice across all its response pathways. This aims to ensure families receive consistent service levels across all Tusla areas, at all levels of need.</p>  <p>  The Tusla-led Early Intervention National Practice Model, Metiheal, is a case co-ordination process for families with additional needs who require multi-agency intervention but who do not meet the threshold for referral to the Social Work Department under Children First.</p>  <p>  When a child and their family need additional supports from several agencies, experience shows they benefit from the agencies taking a collaborative approach. Tusla has established 121 Child and Family Support Networks (CFSN) to support this collaborative approach. CFSNs work in partnership with families to ensure there is &lsquo;no wrong door &lsquo;for families to access support and all families in their locality receive easily accessible, appropriate support to meet their identified needs.</p>  <p>  Tusla also provides specific and targeted interventions for families delivered by Tusla and Tusla funded services. Examples can include parenting supports, counselling, and educational supports. Universal services funded by Tusla take a universal preventative approach when working with children and families, to ensure that parents and caregivers build the knowledge and skills for understanding and providing babies and children with what they need to grow, develop, and stay safe. Examples can include parenting programmes, infant mental health programmes, toddler groups, and youth groups.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided Dormant Accounts Funding of &euro;619,008 under the What Works initiative this year to roll out effective family support programmes. A spending review of Tusla-funded family support services is currently underway and will inform future priorities for investment in these services. </p></reply>

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.</p><p>Core Funding, which begins in September, is the new funding stream worth &euro;221 million in full year costs to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.  Core Funding allows for an estimated 19% increase in the total cost base for the sector to be absorbed without any increase to fees for parents. </p><p>Core Funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain staff; establish career structures; introduce or improve other features of provision that are demonstrated to contribute to quality (e.g. non-contact time, planning, training, curriculum implementation). Staff costs comprise on average approximately 70% of services' operating costs. &euro;138 million has been allocated as part of the Core Funding package to contribute to staff costs.  This is in addition to existing income from other funding schemes and parents' fees.</p><p>The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations contained in 'Partnership for the Public Good'. Fee management will start with the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access Core Funding in 2022. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. This will be developed further in future years.</p><p>Under Core Funding, the vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and no service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be in place.  This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.  This will be open to both private and community providers.</p><p>In relation to the workforce, I firmly believe the level of pay for early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners should reflect the value of their work for children, families, society and the economy. </p><p>The State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine staff working conditions. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue.</p><p>In particular, I began a process in December 2020 to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, which began meeting in December 2021. The outcomes of the Joint Labour Committee will be supported by the new Core Funding stream. </p><p>In addition, in December 2021, I published &quot;Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028&quot;, which includes commitments to develop career pathways, promote careers in the sector, and strengthen supports for continuing professional development, which will complement efforts to improve pay and conditions of employment in the sector. </p><p>Commitments in Nurturing Skills are organised under five pillars:  </p><p>-  Establishing a career framework; </p><p>-  Raising qualification levels; </p><p>-  Developing a national Continuing Professional Development system; </p><p>-  Supporting recruitment, retention and diversity; and </p><p>-  Moving towards regulation of the workforce. </p><p>Successful delivery of commitments under the five pillars will be supported by three &quot;key enablers&quot; that are identified in Nurturing Skills: </p><p>-  Improvement in pay and conditions of employment; </p><p>-  Coordination of the quality support infrastructure; and  </p><p>-  Ongoing engagement with the profession. </p><p>A Monitoring Committee is being established with the task of monitoring the implementation of Nurturing Skills. A comprehensive Implementation Plan is included within Nurturing Skills and covers the first phase of implementation from 2022-2024.</p></reply>

The ERO fixes minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for workers in specified business sectors: employers in those sectors are then obliged to pay wage rates and provide conditions of employment not less favourable than those prescribed. The Industrial Relations Act 1946 sets out the process for adopting an ERO.  </p><p>I acknowledge the independent nature of the Labour Court and Joint Labour Committee (JLC) process and the hard work of its members to negotiate pay and conditions for employees in the early learning and childcare sector. </p><p>I understand that two draft EROs on a number of grades within the Early Years sector have been published by the JLC for the purpose of public consultation. In both cases the consultation processes have now ended, and the JLC is considering the submissions it received during the consultation processes.</p><p>Any ERO that comes into force will set minimum rates of pay for the relevant roles within the sector, and it will be open to employers to pay higher rates of pay than the minimums.</p><p>The new Core Funding stream I announced in the Budget to begin in September 2022 is designed to support a range of objectives, including the drawing up of EROs to determine minimum rates of pay for workers, as well as supporting career pathways and graduate employment.</p><p>Of the &euro;221 million Core Funding budget, approximately two thirds is intended to contribute to improved pay rates across different categories of staff. This portion of the budget cannot be made available without assurances that this funding will be channelled towards achieving this intended objective.  </p><p>Accordingly, a pre-condition of the Core Funding Partner Service Funding Agreement is that Core Funding will only come into effect and is contingent upon EROs being in effect to cover all roles across the sector as defined in the Early Years&rsquo; Service Joint Labour Committee Establishment Order.</p><p>In the event that there are no EROs, or an ERO that only covers one role in the sector in effect on 1st September 2022, Core Funding cannot proceed. </p><p>Officials in my Department are working with Pobal on the development of an alternative funding arrangement for the sector in the regrettable event that EROs are not in effect in time for the introduction of Core Funding in September.</p><p>Without the EROs in place in time, the alternative funding scheme cannot make available the intended funding contribution towards staff costs. Provision will be made to ensure that services do not experience a reduction in income compared to that which they received in higher capitation and programme support payments last year and remain sustainable but the alternative funding scheme will mean that the quantum of funding available to most services will amount to approximately one third of the value that they would receive through Core Funding.  </p><p>I am fully supportive of improved pay and conditions for this valued workforce and achieved significant investment from Government in Budget 2022 for this purpose. I urge the JLC to continue its negotiations to agree EROs for all grades in the sector, including minimum rates for graduate Lead Educators and graduate Managers. I am hopeful that EROs can be agreed swiftly and that Core Funding can go ahead underpinned by the EROs in September.  <b></b></p></reply>

The primary objective of the Transition Fund is to ensure that fees to parents do not increase. </p><p>Participation in the Transition Fund is optional, but I am very glad to see that as of 12 July, 4,076 providers, which represents 95% of all eligible providers, have signed up. Only 239 eligible providers are not signed up to the Transition Fund.</p><p>The Transition Fund remains open to new entrants to sign-up for the remaining months of operation and City and County Childcare Committees are available to support providers who have not yet signed-up.</p><p>The Transition Fund requirement that fees remain at or below September 2021 levels continues in September under the new Core Funding scheme. Under Core Funding, Partner Services will also be required to offer the National Childcare Scheme and/or the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme to parents.</p><p>Taken together, this will benefit parents by ensuring that the full affordability effects of the NCS are felt.  This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and prevent increases in NCS subsidies being absorbed by fee increases.</p><p>The NCS is supporting thousands of families to offset their costs and Budget 2022 has expanded access to the NCS by ending the practice of deducting time in pre-school and school from NCS subsidised hour and by extending universal NCS subsidies for children up to age 15.</p><p>A recent review of the NCS showed that:</p><p>- 38% families had more than half of their early learning and childcare costs were covered by the NCS;</p><p>- 56% families had more money to spend due to the scheme; and</p><p>- 28% families were working more because of NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work without it.</p><p>I recognise however that the burden on some families remains too high and more needs to be done to ensure affordability.</p><p>The introduction of Core Funding in September, combined with developments to the NCS, will improve affordability for parents. Importantly, it provides a platform for additional investment in this coming Budget.</p><p>The high uptake of the Transition Fund bodes well for the introduction of Core Funding in September.  This is further underscored by the fact that 89% of providers have now completed a survey which is the first step to coming into contract for Core Funding.</p><p>While my Department cannot mandate providers to participate in schemes, every effort has been made to carefully design the schemes to meet the policy objectives, including achieving high levels of participation by ensuring that the schemes are attractive to providers. There is strong evidence of this, both through the level of Transition Fund uptake and the early indications in relation to Core Funding.</p></reply>

This Government is acutely aware of this and is sensitive to the effects in certain pockets of society more than others. I, as Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, am working with officials in my Department across all areas under my remit to identify and, where possible, address barriers to participation in education as a result of these pressures. </p><p>In relation to your specific question, Apprentices are primarily employees and all of the 65 apprenticeship programmes are subject to contracts of employment. For the majority of apprenticeships, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer. </p><p>For the 25 craft apprenticeship programmes, the rates of pay applying under the employment contract are either agreed within the relevant sector, or are set out in legally binding Sectoral Employment Orders recommended by the Labour Court.</p><p>On that basis, any review of those rates currently payable is a matter for negotiation and agreement under the appropriate industrial relations structures in place. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to be involved in the determination of apprenticeship pay or training rates. </p><p>It is important to note that, while rates do vary between occupations and sectors, in all cases craft apprenticeship rates are expressed as a proportion of a qualified rate, increasing yearly from 33% of the qualified rate in year one to 90% in year four. Periods of off-the-job training are funded from the National Training Fund with payments of the agreed rate made directly to craft apprentices by the education and training boards during this time.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to note that as employees, eligible apprentices are also entitled to access general employment supports through the social welfare system. This option is open to any employee, apprentice or not, who finds themselves in difficulty. </p><p>Regarding the increases in the cost of living, there are allowances paid to craft apprentices such as travel, accommodation, and meal allowances. A copy of the current rates for these allowances are attached. These allowances are being examining in the context of the upcoming Estimates process. </p><p> </p></reply>

This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and give greater certainty for students in terms of supports.</p><p>For the academic year 2022/23, there are significant enhancements to the financial supports that students who need them most receive through the Student Grant Scheme; where:</p><p>- There will be an increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant;</p><p>- The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant will be increased by &euro;1,000;</p><p>- The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant will be reduced from 45km to 30km.</p><p>Under the Student Grant Scheme 2022, a student in receipt of a postgraduate research award where the stipend portion of the award does not exceed &euro;18,500 can apply to the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) for financial assistance. The stipend portion is treated as an income disregard when calculating the household reckonable income (ie. not counted in the calculation of income). In 2021 this support increased from &euro;16,000 to &euro;18,500. </p><p>Apart from the student grant a number of supports are available to assist postgraduate research students in their studies. This includes a range of grants from research funders, institutional scholarships, as well as supports through the Student Assistance Fund. Research students in receipt of grants must comply with the terms of their funding award from these bodies, which can vary from funder to funder. </p><p>Postgraduate students who meet all of the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are also eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;6,115 and qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro; 6,270.</p><p>The postgraduate office within the higher education institution would also be able to advise on funding supports.</p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Students can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education.  The aim is to ensure that students can participate fully in education, or on an equal basis with their peers.  The Disability Officers actively promote the ethos of inclusive learning for all students. Recently the FSD has also been used for projects to develop strategic disability services in HEIs and supports for students. Examples include inclusive design in teaching and learning, improving online teaching and learning practices, staff training, improving campus experience for students with disabilities, assistive technology supports and autism-friendly spaces.</p><p>Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

Under the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to eligible students attending an approved full-time course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p><p>Approved courses for the Student Grant Scheme 2022 are prescribed in Regulations 3 and 4 of the Student Support Regulations 2022 and in the Student Support Act 2011. In order to be considered for a grant a student is required to be pursuing an approved full-time course under Section 8(1)(b) of the Student Support Act 2011 in an approved institution. Regulations prescribe that an approved course requires attendance by a student on a full-time basis at an approved institution, therefore courses that are online are not currently approved for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme and therefore students attending these courses do not qualify for grant assistance under the Student Grant Scheme.  <b></b></p><p>The issue of potentially expanding part-time delivery of tertiary education in Ireland is a complex one and significant planning will need to be conducted at both national and institution level to manage the significant supply-side impacts on educational institutions. <b><i>Funding the Future</i></b>has committed the Government to financially supporting part-time, blended and postgraduate learning in the medium term, once existing reform commitments are embedded within the sector. </p><p>I have convened a Higher Education Reform Implementation and Review Group to support the development, implementation and review of a reform agenda at national and sectoral level to meet the ambition contained in the funding and reform framework.  The first meeting of this group took place on May 25 2022 and I am excited to hear from the sector representatives in relation to the reform agenda including flexible and lifelong learning. </p><p>Upskilling and reskilling provision in higher education is available through Springboard+ and Human Capital Initiative (HCI) Pillar 1, providing a combined over 13,500 places in over 350 courses available in the 2022/23 academic year. Almost 95 per cent of the courses provided will be delivered in a more flexible format. As well as aiding participation for those in employment, increased online and distance learning provision will allow people from all across the country to access programmes in regions other than where they reside.</p><p>The Springboard+ and HCI Pillar 1 programme is managed by the Higher Education Authority, on behalf of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p><p>Springboard+ complements the core State-funded education and training system and provides free and subsidised upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need. Springboard+ courses are at Level 6 (Certificate) to Level 9 (Masters) on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and are delivered by public and private higher education providers around the country.</p><p>HCI Pillar 1, Graduate Conversion Programmes was launched in June 2020.  Approval has already been granted for courses under HCI Pillar 1 to run for the 2022/23 academic year, as part of the approval process in 2020. These courses are one year, full time conversion courses at levels 8 and 9, in areas of identified skills need, building on experience of the ICT Conversion Courses under Springboard+. </p><p>Over 150 courses are available at NFQ level 9 under Springboard+ 2022 and HCI Pillar 1 for the 2022/2023 academic year. 31 of these courses relate to either Science or Engineering.

The Plan seeks to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum, across a wide range of programmes, by 2025.</p><p>The expansion of apprenticeship across all sectors has widened the impact of apprenticeship in areas of skills shortage such as engineering, retrofitting, technology and fintech. Under the Plan there will be increased online visibility regarding apprenticeship engagement and development processes for employers/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeships. Applications for new apprenticeship development are open on an ongoing basis, allowing employers to progress the development of programmes in response to emerging skills needs on an as-needed basis in all sectors of the economy.</p><p>Development of new apprenticeship programmes has continued despite pandemic challenges. There are currently 65 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 40 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021: arboriculture, equipment systems engineer, healthcare assistant, principal engineer &ndash; professional doctorate, recruitment executive, sales, scaffolding and supply chain associate.</p><p>So far this year, bar manager, wind turbine maintenance technician and transport operations &amp;amp; commercial driving apprenticeships have been launched. Programme development has been approved for programmes in areas such as farming, horticulture, finance, manufacturing, construction, cybersecurity and ICT, with several other programmes at the initial proposal stage. A full list of apprenticeship programmes available and in development is linked below.</p><p>Significant financial supports have been introduced this year under the Action Plan:</p><p>-The annual Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the grant. This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p><p>-The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 42 programmes which meet the criterion.</p><p>Employer feedback during the consultation process of the Action Plan highlighted that non-financial supports were particularly important for SME employers. Recognising this, supports to be in place during 2022 include:</p><p>- The National Apprenticeship Office is linking potential consortia members, education providers, and supporting consortia members and/or provide supports to build in-company training capacity.</p><p>- A development plan is to be delivered for a user-centred apprenticeship management system to simplify employer participation within and across apprenticeship</p><p>- Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967, included in the Higher Education Authority Bill, 2022, will widen the scope for new apprenticeship programmes in an expanded range of sectors.</p><p>The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.</p></reply>

This represents a more than seven-fold increase on 2020 registrations and will support a long-term goal of 7% of the apprentice population being employed by public service employers.</p><p>Whilst it is not yet determined where the apprenticeship roles are best located, the diversity of the public service provides a wide basis for involvement with the range of existing apprenticeships and those programmes in development.</p><p>Apprenticeship provides an opportunity to target and widen the recruitment pool for both generalist and specialist roles within the public service.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s officials have undertaken a number of actions in order to make progress towards achieving this commitment:</p><p>- Several general and sector-focused information sessions on apprenticeship were held late last year.</p><p>- A Working Group has been established, representing Government Departments and agencies and local authorities, to develop a Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan by summer 2022. The Group&rsquo;s work is based on surveying over 100 organisations in relation to their skills needs.</p><p>- More specifically, there has been extensive bilateral engagement with the LGMA to assist with surveying local authorities in relation to their skills needs.</p><p>There is also engagement with the HSE and Department of Health in relation to a commitment in the Action Plan to explore a healthcare assistant apprenticeship programme for the HSE and the options for how this might be piloted. </p><p>The results of the survey of Public Service organisations have now been analysed and a Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan, informed by the survey results, is being drafted.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions via the recurrent funding model.  The amount provided under my Departments B4 subhead and the National Training Fund (NTF) Enterprise Focused Higher Education provision are included in the overall recurrent grant to the sector.</p>  <p>  Recurrent Funding is allocated on an annual basis rather than an academic year basis therefore any increase in the annual grant budget would represent the full year cost of such an increase.</p>  <p>  In considering higher education funding it is important to note that public investment in higher education through my Departments allocation is on an upward trend, and now stands at &euro;2.4 billion. Annual current expenditure has increased by 40% since 2015. I am committed to continuing the process of investing in our higher education system and to the development and implementation of a sustainable funding, reform and performance model for the sector. On 4th May I launched the Funding the Future framework which includes the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future of higher education.</p>  <p>  The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our ambitions to drive reform and support agility and responsiveness in the sector, and the need to ensure that students are supported in accessing education and training. This includes:</p>  <p>  - Planned additional investment of &euro;307 million to address core funding challenges for our institutions, that will be made over a number of years through annual budgetary processes. This does not account for future demographic needs or new policy proposals for higher education.</p>  <p>  - Plans to consider options to address cost as a barrier to higher education, and how we will pursue funding measures on these issues through the Estimates process, including in respect of reductions to the student contribution and enhancements to the SUSI grant in line with the Student Grant Review.</p>  <p>  The provision of Higher Education funding on an annual basis is part of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy for Government. It is of course imperative that funding is made available to my Department to support these plans and I will be seeking to have the additional funding required to address the identified core funding gap and also to address costs for students of attending higher education as part of the annual Estimates processes over the coming years.</p></reply>

Through 2022 Ireland, in partnership with the OECD, is reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s skills strategies, policies and approaches to help us ensure that our skills system is future proofed. A core objective for my Department is to ensure that individuals and businesses are offered supports and pathways to quality education, upskilling and reskilling opportunities.</p><p>The National Training Fund supports initiatives including:</p><p><b>- Skills to Advance</b>is an employee development policy framework which enables targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce; </p><p><b>- Skills to Compete</b>are a range of programmes to respond to the need for activation, upskilling and reskilling;</p><p><b>- Springboard+</b>provides free and subsidised upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need;</p><p><b>- Human Capital Initiative (HCI)</b>range of programmes which seek to ensure that the higher education system as a whole responds to the constantly evolving skills needs of the economy;</p><p><b>- Skillnet Ireland</b>provides subsidised training to business through learning networks operating nationwide and across all sectors.</p><p>The Green Tech Skillnet provides training opportunities in wind energy both for those working in the industry and for people looking to enter the wind industry. The Green Tech Skillnet is an enterprise-led network facilitating the workforce and development needs of the Irish renewable energy industry. It is promoted by Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), the representative body for the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential, economical and environmentally friendly part of the country&rsquo;s low-carbon energy future. A number of renewable energy programmes are funded under HCI and Springboard+, among other Green Skills courses. This includes: a Graduate Diploma in Sustainable Energy Systems at DCU; a Postgraduate Diploma in Wind Energy at Dundalk Institute of Technology; Certificate in Energy Sustainability at South East Technological University; and MEng in Energy Infrastructure at Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest.</p><p>Sustainable green skills are embedded in the Further Education and Training Strategy, which provides that climate change and sustainable development are key components of Further Education and Training (FET) processes. FET will continue to contribute to the Government&rsquo;s call of action to prioritise energy, building and the environment in its processes.</p><p>It is envisaged that the SOLAS Green Skills Action Plan will contribute to clean technologies and the acceleration of the use of renewables. It will contribute to a greater awareness of energy efficiency and the benefits of retrofitting both public and private buildings. The key skills areas to be addressed will include as follows:</p><p>- Creation of awareness of the Green Agenda through education;</p><p>- Increase of capacity in this area;</p><p>- Training and upskilling, which will contribute to green transition.</p><p>Currently, a number of &lsquo;Green Cert&rsquo; training courses are being delivered by Education and Training Boards (ETBs). A &lsquo;Green Cert&rsquo; training course refers to a list of land-based courses, which provides qualifications in Horticulture; Agriculture; Forestry or Equine<b></b>Studies. Upon completion of the Green Cert training course, a qualified person will meet the requirements of a qualified farmer for the purposes of all Revenue and Department of Agriculture (DAFM) schemes. In 2021, there were 600 Learner Enrolments registered on ETB Green Cert training courses. </p><p>In May 2021, an agreement was reached on a pilot project to be launched this year between the Campus des m&eacute;tiers et des qualifications d&rsquo;excellence international normand des &eacute;nergies (CEINE), Dublin &amp;amp; Dun Laoghaire ETB, Kerry ETB, Laois Offaly ETB, Limerick &amp;amp; Clare ETB and Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan ETB. These organisations will seek to build on their shared expertise in the field of Green Technologies Skills. ETB Further Education &amp;amp; Training will have a primary role in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s workforce has the required skills to meet its ambitious energy targets. LOETB has attended two meetings on the pilot for Green Technology Skills CEINE to date. The most recent meeting took place in October 2021 and it was agreed that the initial focus of the Programme would be on offshore wind turbine maintenance in conjunction with Kerry ETB. Other programmes of interest to LOETB, which were referenced at the meeting as potential &quot;start points&quot; of French-Irish cooperation include: Digital Technologies; Sustainable Agriculture and the transition from Peat to Renewable Energy, to name but a few.</p><p>The Wind Turbine Maintenance Technician (WTMT) Apprenticeship was launched in March 2022. Kerry ETB is the coordinating provider for the apprenticeship. It is estimated that there will be in the region of 18 registrations by year end.  It will run for a duration of 3 years and is offered at Level 6 on the NFQ. The rationale for this apprenticeship is that there is no current apprenticeship which provides the range of knowledge, skills and competencies needed for the role of wind turbine maintenance technician. This Apprenticeship is for people who wish to pursue a career in the maintenance of large scale commercial wind turbines. It is designed to meet the needs of the growing Irish Renewable and Sustainable Energy sector. This apprenticeship will create a pathway into this career for school leavers or those who do not currently possess any relevant qualifications.</p><p>Kerry ETB recognised the shortage of training and education opportunities in this area, and in consultation with a number of employers implemented the highly successful wind turbine maintenance traineeship. This traineeship typically lasts 39 weeks and includes a minimum of 30 percent on-the-job training. Upon completion, trainees may receive a City and Guilds Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Electrical Power Engineering. This has been run in Kerry ETB&rsquo;s training facility since 2014 with very high placement rates for trainees involved. However, the entry requirements for this traineeship require potential trainees to hold one of the following:</p><p>- Advanced Craft Certificate (Electrical)</p><p>- Advanced Craft Certificate (MAMF)</p><p>- Advanced Craft Certificate (Motor Mechanic)</p><p>- BEng with related work experience</p><p>The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications has established a cross-Departmental Offshore Wind Delivery Taskforce to drive delivery and capture wider and longer term economic and business opportunities associated with the development of offshore renewables in Ireland. This will include the identification of supporting infrastructure development and supply chain opportunities as Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind industry is developed.</p><p>A cross-departmental Offshore Wind Delivery Taskforce has been established to accelerate delivery of offshore wind actions and ensure alignment of activities in progress across Government. One of the key objectives of the Taskforce is to ensure the longer term economic and business opportunities associated with the development of offshore renewables are captured.</p><p>Ireland has an ambitious skills agenda driven out by an advanced system of skills provision, across Further and Higher Education, lifelong learning and human capital development, which is agile and responsive to changes in the world of work, in order to address evolving skills needs.</p></reply>

Under section 5 of the Act, a district court judge may authorise bodies designated under that Act to carry out surveillance for the purposes of the investigation and prevention of arrestable offences and maintaining the security of the State.  Section 7 of the 2009 Act provides that a member or officer of a body designated under the Act may carry out surveillance without an authorisation in cases of urgency and subject to strict conditions. Section 8 of the 2009 Act provides for the use of a tracking device where approved by a superior officer of a designated body, and subject to strict conditions.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the operation of both Acts is overseen independently by serving Judges of the High Court who are designated by the Government for this purpose and report to the Taoiseach.  In carrying out their functions, the Designated Judges have, by law, full access to all persons and records they consider relevant and all relevant persons have, by law, a duty to co-operate.</p>  <p>  In addition, both Acts provide for a serving judge of the Circuit Court to act as the Complaints Referee. The Complaints Referee is empowered to receive and investigate complaints from persons who believe that their communications have been intercepted or that they might be the subject of surveillance. In carrying out her functions, the Referee has, by law, full access to all persons and records she considers relevant to her investigations and all relevant persons have, by law, a duty to co-operate with her.</p></reply>

CoFPI engaged in extensive consultations as part of the deliberations that informed its report and recommendations including with Garda members and Garda staff and with their representative bodies.</p>  <p>  A central tenet of the CoFPI report is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be a single organisation with a single workforce. </p>  <p>  It found that more integrated workforce structures were required to leverage the different skills and perspectives of Garda members and Garda staff and thereby contribute to enhancing the capacity of the organisation to deliver better policing outcomes for communities throughout the country. To support this, CoFPI recommended that Garda staff should be recruited directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not to the general civil service, and should be treated as valued members of a single Garda workforce with a shared mission.</p>  <p>  The Bill will give effect to this recommendation by providing for the Garda Commissioner to recruit and appoint Garda staff in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004. The Bill will also address the position of existing Garda staff. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that no changes to the status of existing Garda staff will take place solely as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation. A ministerial order will be required before any designation to change the civil servant status of existing Garda staff may be made.  Under the Bill the Minister is required to engage with any trade union or staff association concerned and consider any representations made by them. The Bill will provide for further reassurances on the terms and conditions of existing Garda staff prior to any agreement being reached with relevant unions or associations. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have been in contact with the relevant representative associations to brief them on the legislation, and are available to consult further as required.  </p></reply>

This is a key commitment in my Justice Plan 2022. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes. In September 2020, Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. The General Scheme of the Family Court Bill has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and drafting is progressing with a view to publication of the Bill as soon as possible in 2022.   </p>  <p>  I also established a Family Justice Oversight Group to develop the first national strategy for the reform of the family justice system and to support the legislative changes proposed in the planned Family Court Bill. The focus of the Group is to drive and coordinate the modernisation of the family justice system to make it more user-friendly, streamlined, supportive and, where possible, less adversarial.  The terms of reference of the Group include developing a high-level vision and medium and long-term objectives for the development of an effective national family justice system; this will be most obvious in the development of the first Family Justice Strategy and its subsequent implementation. The Strategy is currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  As part of its work to develop the Strategy the Group engaged in a consultation process where relevant stakeholders, the public, children and young people who engage with the family justice system gave their views on how a modernised family justice system should look.  A number of common issues were raised and are being considered for inclusion in the emergent Family Justice Strategy, including: a greater focus on children; the availability of and access to support services; the potential use of less adversarial approaches to the resolution of disputes, where possible and appropriate; training; information dissemination and awareness raising.</p>  <p>  One of the areas being considered by the Group is additional training for those working within the family justice system that would benefit all those who engage with the system. The Family Court Bill will provide that specialist knowledge and ongoing professional training in the area of family law will be required to be appointed as a Family Court judge.   </p>  <p>  To bring a strategic focus to the question of judicial numbers, I have established the Judicial Planning Working Group to consider the number and type of judges required over the next five years. The Group is expected to report in the Autumn following consideration of an independent review of judicial numbers which is being carried out by the OECD. This review will be benchmarked against international comparisons.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to investing over &euro;270m every year for the next five years in capital projects in the Justice Sector as part of the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030, which represents a significant increase on recent years. This investment will provide for the completion of vital projects including a new family law complex at Hammond Lane. It will also be used to help fund building and refurbishment projects across the Justice sector, including in court buildings. This will be key in helping us achieve our aim of building a justice system that works for everyone.</p></reply>

Guidelines in this regard are posted on my Department's immigration website (www.irishimmigration.ie). Applicants that follow these guidelines have an improved prospect of receiving a positive decision at first instance. </p>  <p>  In order to be fair to all applicants, appeals are processed in the order in which they are received. The processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of appeals, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to keep processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.  This has included the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  The position in this regard is being kept under review.</p>  <p>  The central concern in deciding on visa applications and appeals, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application and appeal is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p></reply>

Ireland is generally regarded as a safe country in international terms, with relatively low crime rates and a general feeling of safety and security. However, we recognise that this is not the case in every community and that people living in disadvantaged areas can experience a different reality. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland recognised that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone, but requires a whole of Government approach. Therefore, community safety goes beyond traditional high-visibility policing and must involve collaboration between service providers to find solutions to safety issues.</p>  <p>  A community safety approach prioritises issues identified by the community itself as safety concerns and increases community confidence in service providers.</p>  <p>  My Department's Community Safety Policy, which is published on the Gov.ie website, will ensure communities are safer and feel safer by making community safety a whole of Government responsibility and priority, to be delivered through Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs), supported through a national governance structure. </p>  <p>  The LCSPs will bring all services and the community together at local authority level, building upon and replacing existing Joint Policing Committees, to serve as a forum for discussion and decisions on community priorities. This means State services working with each other and the community to ensure there is better coordination between services such as educational and youth work with young people, the availability of local health and mental health services, drug prevention, housing and the built environment, and actions taken to combat alcohol and substance abuse, domestic abuse, youth crime, anti-social behaviour, and hate crime.</p>  <p>  The partnership approach is built on two premises:</p>  <p>  1. Every community is different and has different problems and issues; and</p>  <p>  2. Responding to those problems and issues requires a range of inputs from across  Government, local services, voluntary sector and the community itself.</p>  <p>  Three pilot LCSPs have been fully established in Dublin North Inner City, Longford and Waterford. The pilots will run for two years, concluding in Q3 2023, and will be subject to a strict evaluation so that lessons learned and best practice from the pilot phase can inform the further roll out of the LCSP model to all local authority areas after the enactment of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. </p>  <p>  Each pilot LCSP is currently engaged in developing the first iteration of their Local Community Safety Plans and I look forward to seeing their progress in the months ahead.</p></reply>

The Programme was introduced at a time when Ireland was going through a very significant economic downturn and Departments were tasked with initiating innovative programmes to attract investment and create employment as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest.</p><p>The criteria applied when assessing applications under the IIP is set out in the guidance published on my Department's immigration website at: www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-live-in-ireland/i-want-to-invest-in-ireland/</p><p>All projects which IIP applicants are investing in are also examined in great detail by an Independent Evaluation Committee comprising key officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland who have appropriate corporate expertise in this area. This examination process involves an assessment of the commercial viability of the project; employment outcomes associated with the proposed investment; and the overall benefit to the Irish State. The Committee makes a determination as to whether a project is suitable for IIP investment and, if deemed suitable, the individual application will be submitted to me for final approval. </p><p>My Department does not currently publish the details of individual approved IIP investments; however, this matter is currently under consideration  The tables below provide a breakdown of IIP applications received, approved and the value of investments since the inception of the programme up to the end of 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Applications received</th>       <th>Approved applications</th>       <th>Value of Approved   Investment</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1,500,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>18 </td>       <td>16 </td>       <td>12,200,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>30 </td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>4,450,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>75 </td>       <td>71 </td>       <td>38,800,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>334 </td>       <td>33 </td>       <td>18,750,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>324 </td>       <td>373 </td>       <td>253,700,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>423 </td>       <td>156 </td>       <td>139,750,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>443 </td>       <td>237 </td>       <td>209,300,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>339 </td>       <td>270 </td>       <td>188,000,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>258 </td>       <td>265 </td>       <td>186,100,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL </td>       <td>2,249 </td>       <td>1,431 </td>       <td>1,052,550,000 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Approvals issued in any year may relate to applications which were received in previous years due to the time taken to process applications. <table>    <tr>       <th>Investment Type</th>       <th>Total Applications   Approved</th>       <th>Total Value of Investment</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise </td>       <td>780 </td>       <td>639,000,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Investment Fund</td>       <td>214 </td>       <td>196,000,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>REIT </td>       <td>6 </td>       <td>12,000,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Endowment </td>       <td>375 </td>       <td>152,600,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bond &amp;amp; Mixed Investment</td>       <td>56 </td>       <td>53,950,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL </td>       <td>1,431 </td>       <td>1,052,550,000 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

These priorities strengthen the health-led approach, reflect commitments in the Programme for Government and align with the EU drugs strategy and action plan 2021-2025.</p>  <p>  The new structures reflect the partnership approach and give a stronger voice to civil society by broadening and deepening the involvement of community and voluntary groups in the implementation of the strategy.</p>  <p>  Membership of the Groups is comprised of representatives from Government departments and agencies, drug and alcohol taskforces and civil society.</p>  <p>  Independent leadership has been provided to ensure the accountability of all stakeholders. These independent chairs will bring impartiality, insight and experience in addressing the challenges of drug and alcohol use. The independent chairs from each Implementation Group, have become members of the National Oversight Committee, and will report to the NOC on the progress made within their respective group. The next meeting of the National Oversight Group is scheduled for September. There are no Government departments acting as chairs for these Strategic Implementation Groups.</p>  <p>  I am committed to the partnership approach and a stronger voice to civil society organisations in developing national policy.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html</p><p>Payment to eligible staff is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. As of Friday, 8 July, 68,943<b></b>eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 20,000 staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 88,943.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<br /><br />2.  Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<br /><br />3.  Agency roles working in the HSE;<br /><br />4.  Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;<br /><br />5.  Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; <br /><br />6.  Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.   </blockquote>  <p>The above 6 areas only are covered by this Government Decision and all eligible workers will be paid in accordance with the overarching eligibility criteria in place. </p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical or GP visit cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p></reply>

These are set out in the HSE Capital Projects Manual and Approvals Protocol, which is in line with requirements set out in the Public Spending Code. </p><p>The number and cost of projects competing for inclusion in the annual capital plan invariably exceeds the funding available and it is necessary to conduct a prioritisation exercise involving a project prioritisation group in the HSE to determine which projects can be funded in any given year. The prioritisation exercise requires each project to be evaluated and scored by the project evaluation group against a range of criteria agreed with my Department including regulatory requirements, alignment with Sl&aacute;intecare and climate action. </p><p>A draft capital plan is then prepared based on the prioritised projects.

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: .Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. </p><p>The HSE and the Department are now examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<br /><br />2.  Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<br /><br />3.  Agency roles working in the HSE;<br /><br />4.  Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;<br /><br />5.  Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; <br /><br />6.  Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.  </blockquote>  <p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention.</p></reply>

The NSAC has commissioned HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) looking at the addition of other SCID types to the NBS programme. This HTA is underway and I am looking forward to receiving a recommendation from the Committee on this condition after the HTA process is finalised later this year.</p>  <p>  The NSAC is now well established and recently published its second annual report which detailed significant progress in 2021. The Committee's first Annual Call for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received a significant response with a total of 53 submissions received, including on newborn screening. Submissions were received from various sources and are now undergoing consideration by the committee. The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme later this year once it has considered all proposals submitted.</p>  <p>  Given that this is a complex area, careful consideration must be given to the expansion of the NBS programme and these things can take time, however, it is important that decisions are made based on internationally accepted criteria and scientific rigour.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of how difficult it is for parents whose children have received a diagnosis of a rare disease, and how challenging daily life can be for them, their families and their children. It can be an overwhelming situation and can be very isolating for many families because of the significant work that is involved when a rare disease is diagnosed. I am committed to the further expansion of newborn screening in Ireland and in identifying opportunities for future additions to it.</p></reply>

Very significant funding of &euro;77 million has been provided by Government across 2021 and 2022, to increase national capacity to 340 critical care beds by 2023. The HSE has advised that 51 of these beds are now open, bringing permanent adult critical care capacity to 306 beds, from a baseline of 255 beds in early 2020.</p><p>The Strategic Plan for Critical Care, which I brought to Government in December 2020 will, when implemented fully address the recommendation of the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review for 430 critical care beds by 2031. In fact, it surpasses that recommendation, delivering an increase in capacity to 446 over time.</p><p>Importantly, capacity expansion in critical care is focused on the larger &ldquo;hub&rdquo; hospitals, in line with the clinical advice and hub and spoke model of care for critical care. The funding provided in 2021 and 2022 has allowed for the opening of eight additional critical care beds in Saolta University Health Care Group, including six beds in University Hospital Galway, one in Sligo University Hospital and one in Letterkenny University Hospital. </p><p>The provision of additional critical care capacity in accordance with the hub-and-spoke model of care also reflects the overall strategic direction of Sl&aacute;intecare - delivery of the right care, in the right place at the right time.</p><p>As advised in correspondence sent by the HSE in reply to the previous PQs, renovation works in the ICU in Mayo University Hospital are to be incorporated into the overall hospital development control plan. Currently, preparatory work for the implementation of a clinical IT system for the ICU is underway.</p><p>I have asked the HSE to forward to you any additional relevant information, if available, on these clinical IT system preparatory works in the ICU in Mayo University Hospital. </p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants. </p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system. </p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has provided the attached table which outlines the waiting lists for upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy by area of residence for Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan, in standardised time bands of 0-6 months, 6-12 months, 12-18 months and 18+months. The NTPF publishes waiting list data in standardised time-bands and Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) techniques are applied to the data to preserve confidentiality and mitigate against identification or self-identification of individuals.</p>  <p>data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-07-14_pq739-14-7-22_en.xlsx</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: <i>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html</i>. Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1.Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2.Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3.Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4.Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5.Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; </p><p>6.Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system. The NTPF have advised my Department that they have approved one outpatient Ophthalmology initiative for funding so far in 2022 at University Hospital Waterford, which will facilitate treatment for 296 patients on the Ophthalmology outpatient waiting list.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p></reply>

This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.</p>  <p>  I recognise how difficult it has been for the families of nursing home residents who died during this pandemic, which has presented one of the greatest and most wide-ranging public health challenges internationally in recent history. Throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, particularly those resident in nursing homes.</p>  <p>  This included the establishment of a structured nursing home support system, in line with National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendations, to provide enhanced supports to public and private nursing homes. A comprehensive package of direct and indirect supports was established in early 2020 and many of these remain active across the country to support nursing homes on a proactive basis.     </p>  <p>  In addition, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established early in the pandemic in May 2020 to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing response. The Expert Panel report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Four Expert Panel Progress Reports have been published to date, the latest published on 21 June 2022, and all Progress Reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  One of the most important things we can take from the sadness, illness, and death experienced over the last two years is our learning and understanding of the challenges facing the nursing home sector. Through engagement with key stakeholders in the nursing home sector, including residents, their families and advocacy groups, we are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Nursing Homes Expert Panel and a programme of reform is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders to ensure an improved quality of service and experience for residents into the future.</p></reply>

It is proposed that a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use will directly follow these two assemblies, with the intention of running it concurrently with the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the Future of Education, if learnings from the concurrent running of assemblies suggest that this operational model is the best way forward.</p>  <p>  In line with this decision, the Department of Health has commenced preparations for the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use, and, to this end, detailed discussions regarding the assembly took place at the most recent meeting of the National Oversight Committee for the National Drugs Strategy. These preparations are being undertaken to ensure that there will be no delay in establishing this citizens&rsquo; assembly when the two assemblies which are currently operating complete their work before the end of this year or in quarter 1, 2023 at the latest. This will allow a period of over one year for the Government to consider its recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Government is pursuing a health-led approach to drug use through the health diversion programme, which offers compassion, not punishment to people who are in possession of drugs for personal use. The programme will connect participants with health services and provide a pathway to recovery. It will also allow participants to avoid a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly for younger people.</p>  <p>  As we prepare for the Citizens Assembly on Drug Use, work continues to implement the health diversion programme and the strategic priorities for the remaining four years of the national drugs strategy. One of these priorities is to promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences. This priority aligns with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan, 2021 &ndash; 2025, which actively encourages Member States to scale up alternatives to coercive sanctions and to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness for drug using offenders and for people arrested, charged with or convicted for drug-related offences or people found in possession of drugs for personal use.</p>  <p>  I am very positive about the potential contribution of the citizens assembly to the government's health-led response to drug use. Drug use affects all members of society, whether directly or indirectly, and imposes very significant social and financial costs. Involving citizens in decision-making on drugs policy is therefore appropriate.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Department understands that HSE has met with each of the funded organisations as part of the annual Service Level/Grant Aid Agreement process.</p><p>  In 2021, the HSE allocated &euro;244,473 for the NICDATF company for office programmes and resources.

In this context, I have ring-fenced twenty-five percent, &euro;.5 million, of the Community Services Enhancement Fund to increase access to and the provision of community based drug and alcohol services for women, ethnic minorities and the LGBTI+ community.  </p><p>I am confident that this measure will assist in addressing barriers that some women and minority groups face in accessing drug and alcohol services. </p><p>The lived experience of people who use drugs will be central to the design and delivery of the new services, as will the network of drug and alcohol task forces.</p><p>gov.ie - Minister for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy announces &euro;2 million Community Services Enhancement Fund for drug and alcohol services (<i>www.gov.ie</i>) </p></reply>

I have asked the HSE to undertake a process to review, validate and stress test the reconfiguration planning.  My Department is currently engaging with the HSE in relation to this process, with a view to it being completed shortly.</p>  <p>  Since 2019, the number of WTE at Our Lady's Hospital Navan has increased from 516 to 590, which is an increase of over 14%.  In terms of beds, Navan Hospital is currently a Model 3 acute general hospital with 62 medical beds which is an increase on the 58 it had at the end of 2018.  </p>  <p>  There has benn considerable capital invesetment in Navan Hospital in recent years, including E6.35m to upgrade the day surgery area, refurbish the medical ward and extend the rheumatology clinic.  A further sum of E2.5m is to be spent in the future, including E1.3m on upgrades to the medical assessment unit and local injuries unit.   </p>  <p>  As part of increasing ambulatory and day surgery capacity at Navan, the HSE has advised that a second theatre has been completed. This will increase capacity from around 2,500 elective surgical procedures each year to nearly 5,000. As well as the new second general theatre, a new day ward, an expanded recovery room, a new laboratory, a new rehab unit and a new psychiatric day ward have all been completed at Navan recently. Future development plans include a new rheumatology day centre and new endoscopy suite with 4 endoscopy rooms. Confirmation of other investment requirements and plans, including for the longer-term at Navan, will be set out as part of the HSE&rsquo;s planning.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the attached document outlines the IPDC end of year figures from 2016-2021 and end of May 2022 for Mayo University Hospital, and area of residence for County Mayo. </p><p>The NTPF only collects data on patients currently on the waiting list. The time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. As a result, the health system does not have the data necessary to calculate true average wait times.</p></reply>

The cost of GP visit and medical cards varies significantly with the age of the cardholder. Cost calculations require complex and detailed modelling exercises to account for a range of demographic changes, future projections of service demands and variation in the number of GPs and the allowances that could be paid. </p><p>Consultations with the IMO, representing GPs, would be held prior to expansions of GP visit card eligibility and would include discussions on the scope of services to be provided and the rate of fees payable to GPs for the provision of the services. </p><p>For these reasons, it is not possible to give the actual cost of extending GP care without fees to further cohorts. However, the 2019 IGEES paper <i>Costing Framework for the Expansion of GP Car</i>e provides a cost estimate for expanding GP care without charges to all persons under 18 years of age and for universal free GP care. The 2018 ESRI study <i>Universal GP care in Ireland: Potential Cost Implications</i>also provides a cost estimate for universal free GP care.</p><p>Department of Health IGEES staff are currently working on possible options for expanding eligibility to GP care on a phased basis. This analysis includes consideration of costs, demographics, demand and GP capacity.</p></reply>

This included the additional funding of <b>&euro;150 million</b>I secured in Budget 2021 to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services and to provide <b>5 million</b>additional hours of home support.  </p><p>In 2022, our aim is to provide 23.67 million hours of home support which is more than 25% above the 2020 National Service Plan target. </p><p>Work is ongoing to progress the development of the new home support scheme within the broader context of the ongoing reform of our health and social care system, as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. The scheme will provide equitable access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs.  The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) undertook a programme of work on behalf of the Department on the potential demand for, and cost of, home support which culminated in two reports. </p><p>This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  </p><p>An internal consultation process on a range of potential funding options is underway.

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: <i>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html</i>.</p><p>Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. As of Friday, 8 July, 68,943<b></b>eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 20,000 staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 88,943. </p><p>All payments across the HSE and Section 38 organisations are being progressed by local management and each site will assess the eligibility of their staff before processing payment. As eligibility is still being assessed and payments are still being processed across sites locally, I cannot provide you with the number of public service workers who have been paid county by county, at this point. </p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<br /><br />2.  Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<br /><br />3.  Agency roles working in the HSE;<br /><br />4.  Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;<br /><br />5.  Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; <br /><br />6.  Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.  </blockquote>  <p>The rollout of payments to the eligible workers highlighted above has not yet begun, and eligibility has not yet been assessed across the private sector. We expect the rollout to begin shortly and for eligible workers to be paid as soon as possible</p></reply>

I am satisfied that the Government will be able to achieve its stated climate objectives, while at the same time continuing to produce high quality sustainable food. I am also keen that diversification options are provided to farmers as part of our climate transformation. </p>  <p>  Some farmers may choose to take these up, whether it be increased forestry planting or growing grass as a feedstock for an Anaerobic Digestion industry. </p>  <p>  However, the final target that is set for the sector must be realistic, otherwise, there is risk that we will undermine our international reputation as a carbon efficient producer of meat and milk protein. </p></reply>

One fifth of Coillte lands are currently managed with biodiversity as the primary objective, with an undertaking in the Coillte strategic vision to increase this to 50% in the long term. Current projects include the following and their delivery, along with future delivery on  the commitment to increase biodiversity in the longer term, will provide the evidential basis for meeting the biodiversity challenge: </p><p>- The Dublin Mountains Makeover, involving the replacement of non-native with native woodlands;</p><p>- The Midlands Native Woodland Project which aims to plant approximately 4 million native trees across 1500 hectares of Bord na M&oacute;na land no longer used for peat production;</p><p>- The Wild Western Peatlands Project which aims to restore and rehabilitate approximately 2,100 hectares of Atlantic blanket bog and heathland currently planted with lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce forests;</p><p>- The Hazelwood Forest Project in Co Sligo, to remove invasive species and restore alluvial woodlands.</p><p>Furthermore and as stated previously under their new forestry strategic vision, Coillte aims to grow 100,000 hectares of new forests by 2050, supporting the delivery of one-third of Ireland&rsquo;s afforestation target and providing a carbon sink of 18 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>. Coillte are also committing to managing its existing forest estate to capture an additional 10 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>by 2050.  The evidential basis for Coillte's delivery on its cllmate change commitments will be this increased afforestation and the realisation of climate mitigation measures such redesigning poorly productive peatlands, extended rotations on selected stands and better management of broadleaves.</p></reply>

This Group continues to meet and I will continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on these significant challenges.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, I established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  I launched the Teagasc 2022 Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at the start of the year in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  This credible roadmap has helped farmers reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser in the longer-term. Teagasc has also issued revised advice to farmers on the recommended application amounts of fertilisers for silage fields to reflect the increase in fertiliser price.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported feed, I announced a package of targeted interventions for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers on 22nd March. The package supports the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards lowering demand for chemical fertiliser. Following on from the package of measures announced in recent months to provide support to Irish farmers, I launched a &euro;56 million Fodder Support Scheme on 15th June 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to closely monitor the evolving situation and is actively engaging with the EU Commission, across Government and with industry as this situation unfolds </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I am committed to supporting our farm families and their businesses through this very challenging period.</p></reply>

I am also keen that diversification options are provided to farmers as part of our climate transformation.

Employment figures are primarily sourced from the Central Statistics Office's (CSO) quarterly Labour Force Survey. </p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is an essential part of the economic and social fabric of Ireland, especially in rural and coastal areas. Irish food is produced by farmers, fishers and agri-food companies around the country and this locally produced food is exported to over 180 countries around the world. </p>  <p>  Employment in the Agri-food sector accounted for 170,400 people, representing 7.1% of the total workforce in Ireland in 2021. The average numbers employed during 2021 in agriculture, forestry and fishing were 107,000, with 49,650 employed in the manufacture of food products, 7,750 employed in the manufacture of beverages and about 6,000 employed in the wood and wood-processing sector.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Labour Force Survey is based on the main employment a person reports in the survey. Where a part-time farmer reports their off-farm job as their main employment, they will not be recorded as working in primary agriculture. Teagasc in their annual National Farm Survey outline that up to 34% of farm holders have off-farm employment while 54% of farm holders and/or their spouse has an off farm employment.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that while the overall level of employment from these sectors is 7.1% of total employment nationwide, the proportion of employment outside Dublin is much greater. For example, CSO data shows that in the border region the agri-food sector employment accounted for 14.2% of overall employment and accounted for over 12% in the south-east region.</p></reply>

Irish dairy exports exceeded the &euro;5 billion mark in 2021 for the third consecutive year, with exports to over 140 countries worldwide. </p>  <p>  The Irish dairy industry is built on the family-farm tradition. The high quality of Irish milk produced on our family farms from sustainable grass-based production systems contributes enormously to the success of the industry. Our dairy farmers produce top quality produce across the country and their work and efforts keeps our towns, villages and rural areas vibrant, spreading employment and continuing with our great agricultural tradition. </p>  <p>  As a result of the hard work of all dairy industry stakeholders over the last number of years, including our dairy farmers and their families, our milk processors, our regulators, our exporters and our marketeers; international customers across the globe recognise the quality of Irish dairy products. My Department along with Bord Bia will continue to engage intensively with the competent authorities and trade customers in other countries, to ensure that this effort is recognised so that as many markets as possible are available for Irish dairy products.</p>  <p>  In 2021, there were strong market returns across the core categories of butter, cheese and powders, coupled with a diversified market spread, helped sustain a strong demand during the year. </p>  <p>   Food Vision 2030 , the new ten-year strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, sets a vision for Ireland to become a world leader in sustainable food systems over the decade ahead, taking account of the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainability.

A total fund of &euro;13 million is being made available for this voluntary scheme for pig farmers, to support the viability of this important sector. The scheme closed for applications on Monday 11th July.</p>  <p>  The PEPS2 scheme is in addition to the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme I announced in February, funded by the Exchequer and notified under the agriculture de minimis state aid provisions, to support commercial pig farmers. This scheme provided for a payment of up to &euro;20,000 per farmer. All payments have now been processed under that scheme.</p>  <p>  The financial schemes detailed above are part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets, with dedicated media advertising campaigns under way nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.</p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the options available to them. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor the market situation closely and engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing stakeholder engagement my colleague, Minister of State Heydon, chairs quarterly meetings of the Pig Roundtable.  Including representatives from the farming and processing sectors, Teagasc, Bord Bia, and Department officials, the Roundtable's overarching objective is to serve as a vehicle for constructive discussion in driving forward the development of the sector as well as taking a high level approach to guiding the actions for the sector set out in Food Vision 2030.  </p>  <p>  Both Minister Heydon and I want to ensure the long term viability of the sector given its huge importance. </p></reply>

There were encouraging signs in 2021, as bTB levels were lower than in 2020, with fewer reactors and a lower herd incidence. Herd incidence at end of 2021 was 4.34% compared to 4.38% at end of 2020. </p><p>The table below details the number of herds experiencing a new restriction due to bTB, since 1st January each year, by county over the past 5 years to date, and the number of reactors related to these restrictions .</p><p>The reasons for increase in disease over the last number of years often relate to a combination of national and local factors. </p><p>The expansion of the dairy herd since 2015 has had an impact on bTB levels since dairy herds, larger herds, fragmented farms, and herds that buy in cattle are all more at risk of bTB breakdown. Wildlife can also be a factor.</p><p>The causes of bTB outbreaks are complex, and can vary from area to area, requiring a range of actions to address the problem. My Department's policy Divisions are supported by the 16 Regional Veterinary Offices throughout the country, each of which prioritises bTB management. </p><p>The bTB programme in each county focuses on factors including wildlife, how disease is distributed in the area, contiguous programmes, gamma interferon testing, cleansing and disinfection, testing compliance and swift isolation and removal of reactors.  Each bTB outbreak is investigated by a veterinary inspector to identify the source of infection. In the case of every outbreak involving two or more standard reactors, there is a veterinary visit to advise the herdowner on how to eliminate infection and measures necessary to help reduce the risk of recurrence. Emphasis is placed on biosecurity measures a farmer can take to reduce risks on his or her farm, and when buying in animals.</p><p>In an area that show a significant increase in bTB levels, the Regional Veterinary Office (RVO) implements a High Impact bTB Control Plan and works with farmers and other stakeholders to reduce levels of bTB in those areas.  These control plans involve increased levels of testing and other control measures. Intensified co-operation and collaboration with local famers and other stakeholders in these areas helps to reduce the level of disease. </p><p>In 2021, I launched a new Bovine TB Eradication Strategy 2021-2030. Implementation is overseen by the Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum with support from three working groups on science, implementation and finance to ensure that all aspects of the Strategy are addressed.  We now have the building blocks in place to lower disease incidence and reduce the challenges associated with a bTB restriction. </p><p>Ireland's bovine TB Eradication Programme operates in line with best national and international scientific research and advice. A large body of peer-reviewed research has been conducted into the spread of bTB in Ireland and the risks underlying its transmission. This research has found that the principle causes of bTB introduction and spread include:</p><p>movement of cattle with undetected infection;</p><p>residual infection in cattle previously exposed to bTB, but not identified at time of test;</p><p>spread across farm boundaries;</p><p>indirect spread through other biosecurity breaches, and/or</p><p>spread from infected badgers to cattle.</p><p>This research has recently been reviewed in its entirety for the Bovine TB Stakeholder Forum by its Scientific Working Group, which comprises a panel of internationally recognised experts in bTB research.

Successful projects under these schemes are developed in collaboration with local authorities and communities with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs.</p>  <p>  On 21 February , I announced the 2022 Connected Hubs Call. The aim of this fund is to add additional capacity to existing remote working infrastructure in Ireland by upgrading established hubs and Broadband Connection Points (BCPs). </p>  <p>  Eligible works included the expansion of hubs, installation of privacy booths, access control and security systems, the conversion of existing open plan space to modular offices, and the provision of enhanced audio visual, networking and conferencing facilities. </p>  <p>  By the deadline of 4 April, my Department had received 189 applications requesting over &euro;11m in funding. This represents a very high level of interest, and on 8 June, I announced &euro;5.1 million in funding to 81 successful applicants. </p>  <p>  All applications were subject to a uniform assessment and selection process. This process was centred on a competitive scoring system in line with a number of criteria which were publicised in advance of applications being developed and received. </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific hub referenced by the Deputy, the application met the qualifying standard and was assessed and scored competitively along with all other applications. As the Call was significantly over subscribed this year, it was not possible to offer funding to all qualifying applications. Unfortunately, this application was not one of the 81 projects to succeed this year based on the competitive scoring process. </p>  <p>  No additional funding will be allocated through the 2022 Connected Hubs call. I would like to clarify that an unsuccessful application this year will not negatively impact on any future applications to the Connected Hubs Fund.</p></reply>

They include the following:</p><p><b>The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS)</b></p><p>- The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS) was introduced in 2016 and is one of a number of measures designed to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland. Since its launch in 2016 almost &euro;113 million has been allocated to over 1,400 projects across Ireland. </p><p>- The 2022 TVRS places particular emphasis on projects supporting bringing vacant and derelict buildings and sites back into use as multipurpose spaces. </p><p>- Priority A1 provides for projects that bring vacant and derelict buildings and sites back into use as multipurpose spaces, such as enterprise spaces, arts, tourism, youth hubs and other community uses. </p><p>- Priority A2 provides for new build community centres (where there is a clearly identified and defined need in a town or village that cannot be met with an existing premises). </p><p>- Applications for TVRS may be made by sending an expression of interest to the local authority who prepare applications for submission to the Department. The deadline for submission of applications to TVRS 2022 is 22<sup>nd</sup>July 2022. </p><p><b>LEADER</b></p><p>- Funding may be available through the LEADER Programme for the type of project referred to by the Deputy.  LEADER is a multi-annual programme which is delivered through 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs) around the country. </p><p>- Support under the LEADER programme is provided under a broad range of themes, one of which is Social Inclusion. </p><p>- In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. </p><p>- Prospective applicants should, in the first instance, contact their relevant Local Action Group, through its Implementing Partner, to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. The list of all Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on the Gov.ie website at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c45498-local-action-groups</i>.</p><p><b>Community Centres Investment Fund</b></p><p>- I launched the Community Centres Investment Fund on the 15th April 2022.  This is a &euro;15million fund to support community groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with the upgrade and development of their existing community centres.  This is an investment in both rural and urban communities across the country. </p><p>- It should be noted that the development of new community centres is not covered by the Fund.</p><p>- Funding will be on the basis of a competitive assessment process. Guidelines and a sample application form are available at <i>www.gov.ie/en/service/fec91-community-centres-investment-fund/</i>.</p><p>- Applications can be made up until the closing date of Thursday 14th July 2022 at 3:00pm. </p></reply>

These lifeline services ensure that the island communities can avail of reliable, affordable, year round connectivity to the mainland.</p>  <p>  Contracts for these subsidised passenger and cargo services are procured by the Department of Rural and Community Development on the open market through the e-tenders procurement process. This ensures that all providers are treated equally and that the selection process is fair and transparent for all.</p>  <p>  To ensure that a subsidised service remains affordable for the duration of an agreed contract, the Department sets maximum fares that an operator can charge visitors and islanders respectively for using the service. Each operator is free to set their own prices up to the maximum rates specified within the contract.</p>  <p>  The islander rates represent a significant discount &ndash; up to 67% in some cases &ndash; compared to the standard visitor rates, in order to ensure that the services are affordable for island communities at all times of the year.</p>  <p>  The maximum rates vary across the 26 services managed by this Department. Within the contacts currently in place, the present maximum islander rates range from &euro;5 to &euro;12. The comparable maximum rates for visitors range from &euro;6 to &euro;30, meaning visitors pay at least 20% more than islanders and in many cases the visitor rates are significantly higher than the islanders rates. </p>  <p>  The maximum rates for most services have not changed in the past five years. The maximum rates applying to each contract are set out in advance of each service being procured and form an integral part of the contract for each service.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, any unilateral action to alter the terms of the existing contracts could represent a breach of contract and bring the entire procurement process into disrepute, which could have a detrimental impact on the ongoing operation of these vital services.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to examine ways of ensuring the affordability and sustainability of island transport services, both within existing contracts and in future.</p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain any data in relation to non-subsidised ferry services. The Marine Survey Office (MSO) in the Department of Transport may be in a position to provide the Deputy with the information requested in this regard.</p></reply>

The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated national network of 400 remote working hubs by 2025.</p>  <p>  In furtherance of this commitment, my Department&rsquo;s focus to date has been on strategically developing the National Hub Network, the Network's shared online booking platform connectedhubs.ie, adding capacity to Ireland's existing remote working infrastructure and supporting the establishment of new hubs.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;100m has been invested by my department in the development of remote working facilities through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Successful projects are developed in collaboration with local authorities and communities with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs.</p>  <p>  On 8 June, I announced that 81 projects across the country were successful in securing funding via the Connected Hubs Call 2022, allocating &euro;5 million in funding to add additional capacity to the existing remote working infrastructure in remote working hubs and Broadband Connection Points throughout the country. This follows the award of almost &euro;9M under the Connected Hubs Call in 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition to the National Hub Network, my department is working closely with officials at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) to establish the nationwide network of Broadband Connection Points (BCPs). </p>  <p>  BCPs are publicly accessible facilities, typically community centres and sports clubs, in predominantly rural and isolated areas. These facilities offer onsite internet access for a variety of community uses, including skills training and STEM activities for children and young people, eHealth initiatives and remote working. To date 273 of 300 sites are live, with the remainder scheduled for completion this year.</p>  <p>  To date my focus has been on establishing the National Hub Network and the BCP network and on achieving the initial critical mass. Following strong progress on the establishment phase of both projects, my focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. To this end, my officials have been consulting with hub managers across the country, with local authorities and communities, and with other stakeholders, to better inform the future strategic direction of the National Hub Network, the connectedhubs.ie platform and the BCP program.</p></reply>
