It will involve extensive engagement both with industry stakeholders and with the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects on a broad range of issues and will extend over the next 12 &ndash; 18 months.</p>  <p>  Preliminary engagement and scoping has already been undertaken and, following further consultation, a range of position papers will be prepared throughout 2019 and 2020 on issues that are impacting on project delivery.  These papers will be published to facilitate wider engagement with all those working on the delivery of public works projects.</p>  <p>  A review of the public works contract carried out in 2014 noted that the successful outcome of a project is placed in considerable jeopardy by allowing the market to price the risk represented by inadequate definition in a competitive tender.</p>  <p>  Therefore quality of information and enhanced risk management throughout a project&rsquo;s lifecycle will inform all aspects of the review.  Opportunities to further deploy digital technologies, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), will also be explored with the aim of improving workflows and information management for public bodies, contractors and consultants.</p></reply>

Demographic cost pressures from 2017 to 2027 are set out in the IGEES staff paper &lsquo;Budgetary Impact of Changing Demographics 2017 &ndash; 2027&rsquo; published in September, 2016. This paper is based on figures from Census 2016 and focuses on the areas of Health, Education and Social Protection, which are particularly affected by the changing age profile of the population. </p>  <p>  A new analysis is currently being undertaken by officials in my Department. Based on more recent data, this updated paper will examine expected changes in the structure of the population of Ireland and the impact that these changes will have on public expenditure, particularly in the areas of Social Protection, Health and Education. The paper will be published as part of the Spending Review, the third round of which is currently underway. The results of this analysis will inform Budget discussions in relation to 2020 and the medium term. </p></reply>

The OPW and Donegal County Council will work closely to ensure that the projects that are not in the initial tranche of projects to be progressed will be commenced as early as possible in the coming years and within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.</p></reply>

These discussions provided a clear understanding to each of the parties of their respective  positions in relation to this matter and in this context the formal engagement process between the parties was accordingly  concluded on this basis.</p><p>It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and accordingly it is not for the State to provide funding for occupational pension scheme provision.</p></reply>

Under this framework, proposals to implement environmental considerations in public procurement are being developed through the Social Considerations Advisory Group which is chaired by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). </p>  <p>  The OGP are currently developing a circular for Government Departments/Offices on promoting the use of environmental and social considerations in public procurement. The circular will direct Departments/Office to consider including environmental criteria in their procurements, where such clearly defined, quantifiable, verifiable and measurable criteria have been developed by the Dept of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE). These criteria should, if they are relevant to that procurement, be met within a Department&rsquo;s existing budget without impacting on service delivery.</p>  <p>  An overarching objective of all public procurement is the achievement of value for money. In implementing environmental considerations in public procurement, it is crucial that an approach is adopted that will further Government policy while also ensuring a competitive market place where suppliers can compete aggressively resulting in the desired pricing outcome.  In areas where the market is not yet sufficiently competitive, a phased approach to environmental considerations in public procurement may be necessary to encourage the emergence of new suppliers with innovative solutions. Care should also be taken to ensure that the addition of environmental considerations to public contracts is done in a manner that does not mitigate against small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) as they may not be in a position to bear the additional costs or administrative burden.</p>  <p>  The public service must demonstrate its commitment to sustainable development and use its influence to persuade others of the changes required to reduce our impact on the environment. By providing leadership in terms of environmental considerations in public procurement, public bodies can underpin the credibility of national environmental policy objectives and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s image as a 'green' economy.</p></reply>

The NDP seeks to reform how public investment is planned and delivered.  It sets out a strategic vision for Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure priorities over the next 10 years strictly aligned with the National Strategic Outcomes for Ireland&rsquo;s new spatial strategy contained in the NPF. </p>  <p>  The plan signals a shift to a greater integration of regional investment plans, stronger co-ordination of sectoral strategies and more rigorous selection and appraisal of projects to secure value-for-money. Over the course of the plan, &euro;116 billion will be invested in public capital infrastructure priorities. Investment will be increased at a sustainable pace until an average of 4% per annum is invested by 2027. </p>  <p>  A suite of key reforms have been introduced to support the efficient implementation of Project Ireland 2040 and its objectives including:</p>  <p>  - Establishment of a Construction Sector Group to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector;</p>  <p>  - A Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board of Secretaries General meets regularly to ensure effective leadership of the implementation process;</p>  <p>  - The establishment of an Investment Projects and Programmes Office in my Department to coordinate reporting on the plan and to drive reforms included strengthened business case and project appraisal;</p>  <p>  - The publication of a Capital Projects tracker to inform citizens about projects in their area and to give a greater overview to the construction sector;</p>  <p>  - A Capability Review of public sector bodies is being undertaken by my Department to ensure that the State&rsquo;s delivery practices are of the highest standard; and</p>  <p>  - As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland&rsquo;s capital management systems, the Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction procurement strategy and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is reviewing the Public Spending Code. The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.</p>  <p>  These reforms are designed to support public bodies as they work to achieve value for money and to maximise outcomes from investment in public capital infrastructure.</p></reply>

These factors include issues such as costs, quality, service effectiveness and the public interest. This continues to be the case in respect of any new service that is being proposed for delivery by public bodies. </p>  <p>  In concluding the Lansdowne Road Agreement in the summer of 2015, a limitation was placed on the ability of public bodies to outsource existing services. In particular, a restriction was introduced which prevented direct comparisons being made between total labour costs for direct provision of a service against the total labour costs of a potential outsourced provider in the preparation of the business case. This restriction only applies in respect of existing services; that is services that are currently being provided directly by the State or its agents. It does not apply in respect of newly conceived or planned services.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s role is to support public service bodies in exploring all service delivery options that are available to them and to ensure evidence-informed decisions are made when selecting a delivery model. In order to meet that objective, the Department has undertaken a substantial programme of learning and development over a number of recent years to up-skill public service managers on best practice around outsourcing using evidence-based techniques. </p>  <p>  There are no plans for the Department to conduct a review of all outsourcing contracts within the public service.</p>  <p>  However, officials, both within my Department and across the Civil Service, are currently engaged in progressing work in the context of the Spending Review. The Spending Review process aims to improve how public expenditure is allocated across all areas of Government. It places evidence at the heart of policy making by systematically examining existing spending programmes with a view to assessing their efficiency and effectiveness, and to support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities.</p>  <p>  While it is not intended to assess outsourcing and agency recruitment across the public service within this year&rsquo;s review, this topic was covered in the context of the health sector in the Spending Review 2018. Further details of this research, and all Spending Review papers, can be found on the Spending Review website.</p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on each month against expenditure profiles, in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-March 2019 was &euro;15,039 million. This is &euro;343 million, or 2.2% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;14,167 million, is &euro;245 million, or 1.7% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are below profile on current expenditure for end-March. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;872 million, is &euro;98 million, or 10.1% below profile and up &euro;105 million, or 13.7% on the same period in 2018. </p>  <p>  Looking at some key spending areas in particular, gross voted expenditure on Employment Affairs and Social Protection at end-March is &euro;4,997 million, which is &euro;8 million, or 0.2% below profile. Gross voted Health expenditure of &euro;4,219 million is &euro;4 million, or 0.1% below profile for end-Q1. Of this, current expenditure of &euro;4,102 million is &euro;18 million below profile, while capital expenditure of &euro;117 million is &euro;14 million above profile. In relation to Education and Skills, gross voted expenditure of &euro;2,492 million is &euro;71 million, or 2.8% below profile. This is made up of &euro;2,331 million in current expenditure, which is &euro;68 million, or 2.8%, below profile and &euro;161 million in capital expenditure, which is &euro;3 million, or 1.7%, below profile.  Finally, expenditure by the Housing, Planning and Local Government group for end-March 2019 is &euro;410 million. This is &euro;161 million, or 28.2%, below profile. Of this, gross voted current expenditure of &euro;260 million is &euro;112 million, or 30.2% below profile. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;150 million is &euro;49 million, or 24.5% below profile. This variance from profile is due primarily to the finalisation of the Irish Water Memorandum of Funding Agreement 2019. Once this agreement is finalised it is expected that expenditure will revert to profile for the remainder of the year. </p></reply>

It identified 300 communities (and approximately eighty percent of properties) at risk from rivers and the sea. Ninety of these communities were coastal communities.</p>  <p>  The OPW has undertaken detailed analysis of the 300 communities including the preparation of flood maps and plans to determine their vulnerability to the potential impacts of climate change. The OPW&rsquo;s appraisal of flood risk and the choice of future measures took into account the assessment of risk for two potential future scenarios, the: Mid-Range Future Scenario - increase in rainfall of twenty percent and sea level rise of 500mm (20 inches); and, High-End Future Scenario - increase in rainfall of thirty percent and sea level rise of 1,000mm (40 inches). </p>  <p>  These maps and assessments provide valuable information for the OPW, local authorities and other sectors in planning for adaptation against increasing flood risks due to climate change.</p>  <p>  As Minister of State for Flood Relief, I secured &euro;1bn for a ten year programme of investment in flood relief schemes that will protect ninety five percent of properties at assessed risk of flooding. </p>  <p>  The detailed design of the flood relief schemes set out in the Flood Risk Management Plans, published in 2018, will include the comprehensive analysis and assessment of adaptation strategies to ensure that the schemes will protect against, or can be adapted to, potential future increases in flood flows and/or flood levels due to climate change.</p>  <p>  The OPW will shortly be publishing, for public consultation, a revised Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for Flood Risk Management. This is being prepared in line with the requirements of the National Adaptation Framework published in January 2018. </p>  <p>  Adaptation planning is a cyclical process, with the National Adaptation Framework and the sectoral plans prepared under it being reviewed at least once every five years in line with the Climate Act. This will ensure that we adopt a dynamic approach to adaptation planning which is informed by the latest scientific evidence thus enabling Government Departments, Agencies and Local Authorities to modify or escalate adaptation actions, as appropriate. </p></reply>

In addition, a number of suitably qualified Defence Forces members have been seconded to the NCSC and have subsequently transferred to the Centre to work there on a full time basis. The overall aim of the SLA is to improve the Cyber Security of the State through various types of assistance and support whilst also ensuring the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are prioritised.</p>  <p>  From an operational perspective it would be inappropriate to comment on specific elements of the Cyber capability of the Defence Forces other than to say that there is on-going development of Cyber capabilities within the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The transitional military council has said it will govern Sudan for a two-year transitional period after which it promises presidential elections. Sudan's constitution has been suspended, its parliament has been dissolved, and a three-month state of emergency has been declared.</p>  <p>  Despite al-Bashir's removal, the Sudanese Professionals' Association, which is one of the main organisers of the protests, has called for a continued sit-in outside the Defence Ministry. This is to demand a return to constitutional and civilian government. In an attempt to placate the protestors, the initial appointment of the Minister of Defence as head of the transitional military council was swiftly withdrawn , to be replaced by another senior military figure. Negotiations between protestors and the military are continuing and the situation on the ground remains dynamic. </p>  <p>  The recent political changes follow five months of demonstrations, triggered initially by spiralling costs of living. These protests took on renewed emphasis earlier this month, coinciding with the 34th anniversary of a bloodless coup against a former president, Jaafar Nimeiri. </p>  <p>  In attempts over the past months to suppress and disperse protests, Sudanese security forces have used tear gas, stun grenades and live bullets. The use of violence against demonstrators has been widely condemned. </p>  <p>  On 11 April, EU High Representative Mogherini issued a statement complementing a statement by the Chairperson of the African Union Commission which highlighted that a military council does not provide the answers and breached the principles of the African Union Charter. High Representative Mogherini said that only a credible and inclusive political process can meet the aspirations of the Sudanese people and lead to the political and economic reforms Sudan needs. That can only be achieved through a swift handover to a civilian transitional government. In that process, she called on all concerned to exercise calm and utmost restraint. I fully endorse the High Representative's statement. </p>  <p>  On 15 April, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union issued a communiqu&eacute; strongly condemning and rejecting the seizure of power by the Sudanese military and calling on the military to transfer power to a civilian led political authority within 15 days or face suspension from the Union.</p>  <p>  Events continue to evolve and my officials are monitoring developments, through the Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which has responsibility for Sudan, and through our membership of the European Union, including through cooperation with the European Union delegation in Khartoum. Senior officials from my Department also met with the Sudanese Ambassador to Ireland earlier this year to discuss the situation in Sudan. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department visited Sudan earlier this month on a UN organised visit, a key element of Ireland's chairing of the donor group supporting the Office of the UN Humanitarian Coordinator.  During this visit, my officials took the opportunity to raise concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country and the need for timely delivery of principled humanitarian assistance and protection. Ireland continues to respond to on-going humanitarian needs in Sudan through the provision of humanitarian funding, with almost &euro;29 million provided through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners since 2012.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade aims to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level on international election observation missions. Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union or the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE-ODIHR).</p>  <p>  The EU and the OSCE-ODHIR regularly issue calls for the nomination of observers to participate in the election missions organised under their auspices. The Department reviews each call and responds accordingly on a case-by-case basis, including with regard to the overall annual budget available for participation in election observation missions and the resources of the Department's Elections Desk.</p>  <p>  On 3 January 2019 the OSCE-ODHIR issued a call for the nomination of Long Term Observers (LTOs) in respect of the Presidential Elections in Ukraine. As security vetting of the new roster and preparation for training was underway at the time, a decision was taken not to circulate the LTO call.</p>  <p>  On 12 February 2019 the OSCE-ODHIR issued a call for the nomination of Short Term Observers (STOs) in respect of the same election. This call was circulated to roster members who had completed the minimum required National Vetting Bureau procedures. Twenty three roster members - 6 women and 17 men - applied. Having considered each application, and having given full consideration to a special request from the OSCE-ODHIR that Participating States consider increasing their nominations, on an exceptional basis the Department nominated all 23 volunteers - 22 of whom subsequently participated in the mission. </p>  <p>  To support the observation mission during the election's second round, the OSCE-ODIHR requested the nomination of 750 STOs. This call was circulated to those who were already accredited as observers having participated in the first round. In line with the normal number of short-term observers deployed to OSCE election observation missions, Ireland nominated five observers for the second round: on this occasion those nominated comprise 2 women and 3 men.</p></reply>

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him/her. In order to meet this requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship by providing acceptable documentary evidence of this entitlement. Entitlement to Irish citizenship is determined by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. Matters in relation to citizenship fall under the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  It is not clear from the information provided if the individual in question is an Irish citizen. In the absence of such information, it is not possible to give specific guidance but it may be helpful to set out the ways in which an individual can demonstrate a claim to Irish citizenship. </p>  <p>  The citizenship of persons born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 is determined by the citizenship or residency status of one of their parents at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth. </p>  <p>   An individual born on the island of Ireland before 2005 or born to a parent who was born on the island of Ireland before 2005 is automatically an Irish citizen. </p>  <p>  A person born on or after 1 January 2005 may claim citizenship by birth where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four preceding his/her birth (a total of 1,095 days).</p>  <p>  Individuals born outside of Ireland can also claim citizenship through a parent who was not born in Ireland but was an Irish citizen at the time of the individual's birth, or through a grandparent born in Ireland. Individuals who wish to claim citizenship through these means must have his/her birth entered on the Foreign Births Register (FBR). Citizenship commences after inclusion on the FBR. Further information regarding the process can be found on the Passport Service's website.</p>  <p>  Irish citizenship can also be acquired through naturalisation. Minimum residency terms must be satisfied before an individual is eligible to apply. Where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship at birth, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied.</p></reply>

However, it was discussed at the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on 9 April, which I attended together with Minister of State McEntee. At that meeting, the Ministers prepared the agenda for the European Council the following day. In light of Prime Minister May's letter of 5 April, Ministers considered the UK's request for a further extension to the Article 50 process.</p>  <p>  On 10 April the European Council agreed to extend the date of the UK's departure from the European Union until 31 October. However, should the UK ratify the Withdrawal Agreement before then, it will leave the EU on the first day of the following month. One of the conditions of the extension is that the UK must now hold European Parliamentary elections. If it does not, the UK will leave the EU on 1 June.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the decision of the European Council, which provides the UK more time to ensure an orderly withdrawal. Of course, the UK retains the right to revoke its Article 50 notification at any time. </p>  <p>  The European Council made clear again that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, cannot be re-negotiated, and that any unilateral commitments by the UK Government should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement. We welcome these important assertions.</p>  <p>  The European Council also made clear that this time cannot be used to begin negotiations on the future relationship, which will begin once the withdrawal has taken place. Hoevever, importantly, should the position of the UK evolve, then the EU would be prepared to reconsider the Political Declaration on the future relationship. </p>  <p>  Throughout the duration of the extension, the UK will remain a full member of the EU. We welcome the UK&rsquo;s commitment to act in a responsible and constructive way during the extension. This commitment is important as we must safeguard the effective functioning of the EU.

In particular, they argue that the provisions in question are contrary to the right to privacy. In February 2019 a decision on the case was deferred to 24 May, with the significant volume of judicial caseloads the reason for the adjournment.</p>  <p>  In a separate case in March of this year, the Kenyan Court of Appeal upheld a High Court decision directing the Non-Governmental Organisations Coordination Board to register the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC) as an NGO. The NGLHRC had been struggling for formal registration as an NGO since its foundation in 2012. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the Kenyan Film Classification Board banned the screening of a film, Rafiki, selected to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. The film was banned for its &ldquo;clear intent to promote lesbianism&rdquo;. The High Court later granted an application to lift the ban for seven days to allow the director to submit it to the 2019 Oscars selection committee of Kenya. </p>  <p>  Against a backdrop of societal unease, a change in current laws would assist in enabling a broader acceptance across Kenyan society of same sex relations.  </p>  <p>  The promotion and protection of human rights, including LGBTI+ rights, is at the heart of Irish foreign policy. In accordance with our commitment in The Global Island &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World, Ireland works on an international level to promote the rights of LGBTI+ people, who continue to face disproportionate levels of violence and systematic discrimination, through our multi-lateral engagement with the United Nations and the European Union as well as our engagement in regional organisations such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE.  </p>  <p>  A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for international development, acknowledges that members of the LGBTI+ community often experience systemic levels of discrimination and marginalisation, and that threats to human rights and civil society space undermine the basis for peaceful sustainable development in many contexts.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively monitor human rights, including LGBTI+ rights, in Kenya through our Embassy in Nairobi, and through our cooperation with the European Union Delegation in Nairobi.</p></reply>

The FAI were selected for audit review in 2017. There is no intention at present to conduct an additional review of funding previously granted to the FAI through the ESP.</p>  <p>  Organisations awarded grants from the Reconciliation Fund are required to meet strict reporting requirements to ensure that expenditure and progress in delivery of programmes can be appropriately monitored by the Department.  The terms of agreement under which grants are awarded also provide for auditing spot-checks on grant recipients to be undertaken by the Department each year.</p>  <p>  In 2008, the Reconciliation Fund supported the FAI with a grant of &euro;25,000 towards an all-island coaching conference for over 400 voluntary grassroots football coaches, organised in partnership with the Irish Football Association in Northern Ireland.  No grants were made to the FAI from the Reconciliation Fund prior to, or since, that grant in 2008, nor has an application for funding been made by the FAI in the current funding round.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are undertaking a review of records relating to that grant and will follow up with the organisation as necessary, to ensure that there is full compliance with reporting requirements. I would be happy to update Deputy Murphy on progress with that review in the near future.</p>  <p>  Applications received through the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) and the Reconciliation Fund are prioritised based on how strongly they meet the criteria and objectives associated with each scheme. They are competitive grant processes, and applications received each year are considered on their merits. Grants to individual organisations under these schemes are made in line with agreed application and approval processes, which include ensuring proper procedures are in place for the financial management of funding provided, and that strong governance structures are in place to enable delivery of the project.  Any funding application received by my Department from the FAI would be assessed in line with the established policies and grant scheme criteria and taking account of any other information which would be relevant at that time.</p></reply>

The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p>  <p>  The devolved institutions of the Agreement are urgently needed so that the Assembly and power-sharing Executive can represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern. There are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas, which require a functioning Executive and Assembly.</p>  <p>  The North-South Ministerial Council is also essential to oversee and develop North-South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Following the most recent roundtable consultations by the two Governments with the parties on 15 February, I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving a resolution.  However, I continue to believe that this can be achieved and there is an increasingly urgent need for talks to begin.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the difficulties that have arisen in relation to the UK exit from the European Union and getting the Withdrawal Agreement ratified by the UK have predominated in recent weeks. However, the Government has always strongly argued that the challenges raised by the UK exit must not stand in the way of getting all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement up and working again. Indeed, the challenges raised by the UK exit from the European Union for the island of Ireland are further profound and compelling reasons for the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and the North-South Ministerial Council to be operating on behalf of citizens, and in accordance with their respective mandates under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Both Governments remain determined to find a way beyond the current impasse to get the institutions of the Agreement operating again.  The legislation that was brought forward by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, which temporarily suspends the requirement to call an Assembly election, underlines the urgent requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Secretary of State and remain in regular contact with the leaders of each of the political parties to get the necessary political process underway to secure an agreement for a functioning Executive and Assembly and North-South Ministerial Council.</p></reply>

Irish REITs are collective investment vehicles which invest in Irish property. As such, their income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when distributed. REITs must distribute at least 85% of their property profits and gains to their shareholders each year. A REIT is subject to corporation tax on any income or gains arising from any other, i.e. non-property, business it carries on.</p><p>The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption, but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by providing the same after-tax returns to investors as direct investment in rental property and removing a double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. </p><p>Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at 20% must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pensions and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax. I am advised by Revenue that the available information is the net DWT collected in respect of dividends paid by REITs for 2015 onwards, as shown in the table. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount   of DWT Collected</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;4.0m</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;7.8m</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;11.8m</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;12.4m</td></tr></table></p><p>I am advised by Revenue that, due to the obligation to maintain taxpayer confidentiality, it does not disclose information in circumstances where the number of cases is so small that it might facilitate identification of the taxpayers involved. As this is the case with Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), it is not possible for Revenue to provide the further information requested.  However I would note that REITs are required to be publicly listed companies and as a result they publish a wide range of detailed information, including financial reports, which would provide some of the information requested by the Deputy. </p></reply>

Up until end-2018, NAMA had identified a total of 6,984 residential properties as being potentially suitable for social housing. Of the units identified, demand was confirmed by local authorities for 2,663 properties, of which 2,481 have been contracted or delivered for social housing use by end-2018. </p><p>It is important to note that the confirmation of demand and decisions regarding the suitability of properties is a matter for the Housing Agency and local authorities, and NAMA plays no role in this. I am advised that local authorities take account of the requirement to provide an appropriate mix of housing tenures and to avoid undue housing segregation within individual developments and wider residential area. Social housing units are provided to local authorities; approved housing bodies (AHBs) or the Housing Agency and delivery can take the form of direct purchase or long-term leasing via NARPS. Of the 2,481 properties delivered to end-2018, local authorities have directly acquired or leased 234 units; AHBs have acquired or leased 2,228 and the Housing Agency has acquired 19.</p><p>The table below outlines the number of potentially suitable residential units identified by NAMA and the total number completed/contracted to end-2018, indicating delivery either to the local authority, Housing Agency or to a AHB.

HBFI has been provided with access to &euro;750 million of funding from the Irish Strategic Investment fund, with which it is expected to facilitate the delivery of  7,500 units over the next five years.</p>  <p>  Since its formal launch at the end of January, HBFI has engaged actively with small and medium sized builders and developers throughout the country through a range of market awareness raising initiatives.  As part of this, HBFI attended a series of workshops organised by the Construction Industry Federation  (CIF) and its constituent association, the Irish Home Builders&rsquo; Association (IHBA) that were strongly attended by small and medium sized builders and developers and generated significant interest in the work of HBFI.</p>  <p>  Collectively, HBFI&rsquo;s various engagement activities have resulted in a strong pipeline of interest from prospective borrowers. While no funding has been drawn down by borrowers to date, HBFI has approved its first lending facilities and is progressing a number of other applications through its credit process.   </p>  <p>  HBFI will be in a position to publish information on its lending activities on a half-yearly basis with the first such report to be published in July 2019.</p></reply>

This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  Significant engagement has taken place with unions on this matter but it continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and that it is not for the State to provide funding for such pension scheme provision. The employees in question are, or were, employees of private companies notwithstanding the fact that the companies concerned are, or were, in receipt of State funding.</p></reply>

These latter projects may be either elective conservation works which are planned well in advance or emergency works required urgently to retrieve fabric or correct a serious structural issue / pending collapse.</p><p>In the period 2016 &ndash; 2018, the OPW has worked on a number of substantial projects of varying scale within the National Monuments portfolio in its care together with ongoing maintenance of both buildings and sites.</p><p>As the Deputy can appreciate, given the large number of sites in the portfolio and their broad geographic spread right across the country, a significant team of skilled construction specialists and general workers is deployed to keep properties in good order.  In terms of funding, a considerable portion of the OPW&rsquo;s annual budget for heritage therefore relates to operational staff wages expended on the skilled labour force that performs most of the tasks.  Relatively less funding is provided for non-pay elements which are expended on items such as construction materials (stone and timber), and specialist services not available within OPW such as laser scanning, archaeological investigation, and other professional specialisms.</p><p>In terms of OPW&rsquo;s total heritage spending on the National Monuments estate in State care for the last three years, including both pay and no-pay elements, the following is the position:</p><p><table><tr><th>2016 </th><th>2017 </th><th>2018 </th></tr><tr><td>15,082,181</td><td>15,953,852</td><td>17,461,833</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Such acquisitions tend to be made only in exceptional cases where a monument is not otherwise adequately protected.

A key responsibility of each Minister and Department is delivering public services efficiently and effectively within their budgetary allocations. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed in line with not only Departmental allocations but also within the overall fiscal parameters. Each month, the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on against published expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-March 2019 was &euro;15,039 million. This is &euro;343 million, or 2.2% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;14,167 million, is &euro;245 million, or 1.7% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are below profile on current expenditure for end-March. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;872 million, is &euro;98 million, or 10.1% below profile.  </p>  <p>  Given the scale of Government expenditure, &euro;66.6 billion in aggregate for gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2019,  and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues, and overspends. At this early stage of the year, the key requirement for all Departments is to have credible plans to manage within the allocations voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last week.</p>  <p>  To assist in this process, a range of reforms have been put in place over the last number of years with the aim of focusing attention on achieving value for money. For example, the Performance Budgeting initiative seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure. As part of this initiative, the third Public Service Performance Report will be published in the coming weeks and will provide outturn performance information for 2018 as well as trend data for the previous two years. </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently in year three of the Spending Review process. The Spending Review aims to place evidence at the centre of policy development, through the examination of existing policies and programmes to assess their efficiency and effectiveness. This systematic examination of existing expenditure can support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities.  </p></reply>

At a national, European and international level, it has never been more important for people to understand the lessons of history. As we face the very difficult challenges of Brexit, while also addressing the impact of the first World War, the War of Independence and the Civil War, the Decade of Commemorations will demonstrate on our island the importance of understanding the historical context.</p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the framework for the junior cycle, history was a core subject in voluntary secondary schools, which make up 52% of schools. However, it is important to note that currently 90% of students across all school types choose to study history.</p>  <p>  The new junior cycle programme has greatly enlivened subjects, with a new emphasis on projects and self-directed learning. As part of the roll-out of the new framework for the junior cycle, the new history specification was introduced to schools in September 2018. The minimum time allocated for the teaching of history is 200 hours over the three years of the junior cycle programme, which is the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week. I understand that for many schools this will lead to increased time provision for the teaching of history.</p>  <p>  I have met officials of the NCCA and asked that a review of the optional nature of history under the new framework for the junior cycle be carried out. I expect to receive that report from the NCCA shortly.</p></reply>

At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post primary to the recruitment of teachers of particular subjects such as STEM, modern foreign languages, Irish and Home Economics.</p><p>In response to these difficulties, the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established in March 2018.</p><p>The Steering Group is considering the issues that relate to teacher supply under four policy headings: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession.</p><p>The Steering Group is overseeing the Action Plan for Teacher Supply, which I published in November 2018 with twenty-two actions in the four policy areas. It is supported in its work by the Teacher Supply Implementation Group and a number of working groups that are looking at specific policy areas.</p><p>A number of specific measures are being taken to increase the pool of available substitute teachers.  These include:</p><p>- For the 2018/19 school year, the restrictions on the number of days that teachers on career break may be employed were suspended.</p><p>- Retiring teachers were given information that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days, they must maintain registration with the Teaching Council.</p><p>- My Department is considering the removal of the restriction on job-sharing teachers undertaking substitute work.</p><p>- An online substitute teacher recruitment portal is being developed. It is intended that the portal will be in place for the next school year.</p><p>Other actions that have been progressed to address challenges in Teacher Supply include:</p><p>- My Department published Circular 0015/2019 with details of a new teacher sharing scheme for post-primary schools, commencing in the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>- Following engagement with the HEA, a number of HEIs will provide new post primary initial teacher education (ITE) undergraduate programmes in 2019 in priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages and Irish. The HEIs also plan to commence more new undergraduate ITE programmes in 2020.</p><p>- The HEA is engaging with HEIs to explore the development of programmes to upskill existing teachers in targeted post primary subject areas and to examine the potential for flexible ITE programmes.</p><p>- The Teaching Council, at the request of my Department, is reviewing the implementation of school placement guidelines for student teachers, with a particular focus on school/HEI partnerships.</p><p>- The Teaching Council is developing more streamlined processes for the registration of teachers qualified in jurisdictions outside the State.</p><p>- In the current academic year, an additional &euro;1m has been allocated to the Student Assistance Fund for Professional Master of Education (PME) students, increasing the overall fund to &euro;10.1m.</p><p>- In December 2018 a national campaign for the promotion of the teaching profession was launched across a number of platforms, including radio and digital media. The campaign issupported by a new webpage providing information about teaching as a career ().</p><p>In addition, following from the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education:</p><p>- An Irish-medium Masters in Education for primary and post-primary teachers, including principals, commenced in September 2018 in Mary Immaculate College.</p><p>- The number of places on the Irish medium post primary postgraduate ITE programme in NUIG (M&aacute;istir Gairmi&uacute;il san Oideachas, MGO) was increased from 2018/19.</p><p>The Steering Group and the various working groups reporting to it continue to meet on a regular basis and I hope to be in a position to announce further developments in this area over the coming months.</p></reply>

Building on the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, the Working Group considered proposals to enhance the approach to tackling low level offenders and effectively addressing their offending behaviour through a Community Justice Intervention type programme. This would be a diversion from the courts system in a way that has the potential to respond more effectively to one-off and repeat, low level offending with the emphasis on speedy processing aimed at reducing the risk of re-offending and would also offer quick referral to the necessary services.</p>  <p>  My Department wishes to build on this work and continues to examine a number of possibilities, including the creation of a conditional cautioning system of which there are a number of models. Plans for a pilot project on costs in relation to establishing a community court system in Dublin have been put on hold while the Department examines the options available.</p></reply>

I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>The Deputy raised a number of questions relating to the cost and staffing involved in public order policing. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the costs associated with the running of Public Order Units are not accounted for separately but rather are included in the total cost of running Garda Divisions. As a result, I am informed that it is not currently possible to isolate the costs in respect of the Garda Public Order Units.</p><p>Regarding personnel, I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are Garda&iacute; with specialist training in public order policing in each Division.  These Garda members are only required to perform public order duties when operational demands require their deployment, otherwise they are engaged in routine policing duties.  I am further informed that the Garda National Public Order Unit, GNPOU, is not a full time unit. Members trained in public order are deployed from across the organisation on a case-by-case basis if and when the need arises.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the following table as provided by the Garda authorities sets out the number of Garda members who are qualified to operate in the Garda National Public Order Unit in both the Dublin Metropolitan Region and nationally, correct as of 17 April 2019.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin Metropolitan Region</td><td>635</td></tr><tr><td>Nationwide excluding the Dublin Metropolitan Region</td><td>537</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1172</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Of these 2,156 (14%) related to unfair dismissal cases, either singularly or combined with other complaints under employment rights and equality legislation. The WRC held 5,312 hearings during 2018 which is an increase of 22% compared to 2017 and 2,964 decisions were issued which was an increase of 32% on 2017. </p>  <p>  However, where parties are not available for hearings and seek postponements, often more than once, the median time from receipt of complaint to issuing of decision is nine months. Furthermore, following a hearing an Adjudication Officer may often require a party to submit additional information.  Fair procedures dictate that the other side is afforded the opportunity to provide observations on this material.  It follows that delays in finalising decisions can arise.  </p>  <p>  Against this background, the WRC&rsquo;s aim is that decisions should issue within 6 weeks from the hearing or the date of receipt of the final piece of relevant information. However, it must be borne in mind that some decisions, e.g. unfair dismissal, equality issues, are more complex than others and may take longer than this to formulate. At end 2018, the median time from final hearing to issuing of decision was 13 weeks. This has declined slightly in 2019 and the work programme for 2019 has set a target to reduce this by a further two weeks over the course of the year.  The recruitment of a further cadre of Adjudication Officers who will come on stream during 2019 will assist in meeting this goal.</p></reply>

The approval of the Negotiating Directives is a key step on the road to a possible future trade agreement between the EU and US.</p>  <p>  The Negotiating Directives make it clear that agriculture is specifically excluded from these negotiations; something I had sought specific assurances on from EU Trade Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m in Council last year.  </p>  <p>  I believe a future trade agreement between the EU and US that is targeted specifically at the sectors of conformity assessment and the removal of tariffs on industrial goods, coupled with the lifting of current US tariffs on steel and aluminium products, would be a positive development for our economy and for jobs.  A recent economic analysis released by the EU Commission found that such a targeted EU-US agreement would increase EU exports to the US by 8% and US exports to the EU by 9% by 2033.  In this context, where Ireland and the US have a bilateral trading relationship worth more than &euro;100 billion per annum, the potential gains for Ireland, and resultant employment, from an EU-US trade agreement would be very positive.  </p>  <p>  It will now be a matter for the EWG to determine the timing of the commencement of these EU-US trade negotiations.</p></reply>

This will continue with ongoing day-to-day review of the appropriate staffing mix across my Department in response to evolving policy and operational priorities. </p><p>My Department has seen a careful increase in overall staffing numbers over the past three years.  This has been due to: the filling of critical vacancies that existed; significant priorities emerging from environmental challenges, such as Brexit, and; new bodies of work, for example the Digital Single Market - impacting on the resourcing needs of the Department.</p><p>In this regard, the Department operates a robust workforce plan, on a three-year rolling basis, and liaises directly with the Public Appointments Service (PAS) and Top-Level Appointments Committee (TLAC) in relation to the filling of posts.</p><p>The Secretary General of my Department is one of four Secretaries General leading the delivery of Action 8.5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan &ndash; &ldquo;To improve gender balance at each level by reviewing supports and policies to ensure these measures are impactful and measurable&rdquo;.</p><p>The Civil Service has set an ambitious target to achieve 50/50 gender balance in appointments at senior levels.

That&rsquo;s why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility. Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that businesses around the country can manage risks and avail of any opportunities. This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m. This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.</p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs], up 22% on 2018, which have a presence in every county, to support start-ups and growth and, in particular, to support businesses to prepare for Brexit. The LEOs will work with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This includes a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.</p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence and find new markets. This new Scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. I announced the first 11 successful applicants on Friday 01 March last and there will be a further call for proposals this year. In addition, Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018. </p><p>Funding to InterTradeIreland has been increased by 18% and they, along with the LEOs, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. </p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme opened for eligibility applications on Wednesday 17 April and it will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million.</p><p>The first table attached sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019 and the cost/expenditure of the supports available. Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p><p>The second table attached sets out the uptake of the different Brexit-related supports available through the Department and its agencies as at 08 April 2019. </p><p>Finally, while we have had great success through the Action Plan for Jobs in reducing unemployment from 16% to 5.6% today, in the context of Brexit and other global challenges, it is important that we move our focus beyond numbers of jobs created to quality and sustainable jobs. </p><p>Future Jobs Ireland is our plan to meet all these challenges. Launched on 10 March 2019, it includes ambitious targets and actions to drive this transformation of our economy. These includes funds, policies and initiatives that; enhance productivity, especially among SMEs; promote indigenous entrepreneurship, especially in the regions; encourage clustering and stronger links between domestic and foreign owned firms; and assist businesses to move up the value chain, to protect jobs and to build resilience for the future.</p><p><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Uptake (8 April 2019)</th></tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td><td>567 applications received, 511 approved by SBCI, 105 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;23.691 million.<br /><br />(Uptake as of 8 April 2019)</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit </td><td>5,113 Brexit Scorecards have been completed. 992 LEO clients have completed the scorecard.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td><td>182 Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new  markets</td><td>140 projects have been approved under this initiative</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Prepare to Export Scorecard</td><td>2,988 Prepare to Export Scorecards have been completed</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Customs Insights Online Course</td><td>1,178 Customs Insights Course participants</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding</td><td>47 Agile Innovation projects have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td><td>16 Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over 1,200 in attendance</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td><td>210 &ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period</td><td>1,062 Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant   for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities</td><td>518 clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant (end March 2019)</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td><td>247 LEO clients have participated in the programme (end March 2019) </td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td><td>562 mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit (end March 2019) </td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars/Events </td><td>4,213 Participants at the Brexit Information events (end March 2019) </td></tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service</td><td>2,419 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019.This is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018.</td></tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Start to Plan Vouchers</td><td>There have been 1,401 applications, with 1,214 approved and 31 still pending assessment. </td></tr><tr><td>Pilot Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland</td><td>11 retailers were awarded funding in February 2019.

Indeed it must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this.</p><p>The OPAP policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. A new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group was established in October 2017 and a progress report on each recommendation in the OPAP is currently being finalised under the aegis of the Oversight Group. </p><p>The HSE is responsible for the implementation of  a number of actions in the OPAP, including actions relating to the prevention and management of overweight and obesity in both children and adults.</p><p>Funding for actions led by the HSE is dealt with as part of the annual estimates and service planning process.</p><p>The recommendation referred to by the Deputy calling for obesity impact assessments for new planning developments that impact on children and their families is aligned by the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group with Step 2 of the Obesity Policy Action Plan 'Regulate for a healthier environment'. One of the Actions under this Step is to &quot;Develop guidelines and support material for those working in developing the built environment for urban development and planning in relation to reducing the obesogenic environment&quot;. The OPAP recognised that changing the obesogenic environment is a critical factor underpinning the success of maintaining the population at a healthy weight. The prevention approach aims to gradually change Ireland's food environment to one that facilitates consumption of healthier food and drinks and fosters active lifestyles. The OPAP acknowledged that food and retail outlets are more widely available now than ever before and that this becomes important as children have discretionary income and may not follow the healthy eating guidelines. It therefore declared that it is important that the health input into the local area planning process is consistent and evidence based. </p><p>This area is being progressed through engagement with other Government Departments to support the work of stakeholders involved in planning and developing the built environment.</p><p>In line with Actions 31 of the National Physical Activity Plan and 2.1 of the OPAP, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity and reduce the obesogenic environment, a Stakeholder Forum was held on 21 November last. </p><p>The event was planned in partnership, with substantial input from three Government Departments, (Health; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Housing, Planning and Local Government). Following on from this Forum, a working group made up of representatives of all three departments was convened to consider the outputs of the stakeholder forum and related recommendations, including the ones aligned with the recommendation referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>Finally, the question of legislation around planning matters for the issue is ultimately a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and I understand that he has addressed the position on this in his reply to Parliamentary Question 34831/17. For convenience a link to this question is .</p></reply>

something found in other countries - is very tightly drawn and its criteria for when a consent declaration can be given is directed not only at GDPR considerations but also at the Common Law, Constitution and ECHR.  That was done to ensure that all relevant factors must be addressed both in the application for a consent declaration and in the consideration of that declaration.  It is the same reasoning that means that a declaration when granted can only ever extend to obtaining and using personal data required for the research or part of the research but such data cannot then be disclosed to anyone else without the consent of the data subject or a legal obligation to do so.  It is also important to emphasise that a consent declaration cannot be given where a data subject has refused his or her consent to the use of his or her personal information for the research involved. </p>  <p>  Everything that is provided for in the Health Research Regulations was subject to a series of discussions with the Data Protection Commission.  The rigorous nature of that consultation process provided a very useful stress test.  In particular, the Department and the Commission had careful regard to the issue of genetic data against the backdrop both of scientific developments in the genomics area and the GDPR requirement that genetic data, as a special category of sensitive personal data, is subject to strong safeguards. </p>  <p>  Health research is indisputably important to better patient care and the development of innovative and life-saving therapies.  As Minister, I want to support health research and I believe most people do.  I believe that the best way to do so is to promote and sustain greater public confidence in research through enhanced openness, transparency and patient empowerment so that no individual is surprised by who has access to his or her personal data and the research uses to which it is put.  Without that confidence, the necessary support for health research that has the potential to bring considerable benefits, especially in evolving areas like genetics and genomics, will not be forthcoming.  For that reason, it is in the interests of all those involved in health research to work with us in building that confidence.</p>  <p>  One final point, the Minister for Health does not have the power to give anyone permission to collect DNA from Irish hospitals, GP practices or health centres.  Those samples, where collected, must be collected on the basis of informed consent and that informed consent determines who has access to the samples and what the samples and any related personal data can be used for.  Responsibility for proper governance in relation to those samples and the associated genetic data lies firmly with the institutions that collect and hold them.  Failure to adhere to proper governance may have significant consequences under law for the institutions and any employees or agents involved.  There will also be serious reputational damage affecting health research in Ireland generally.</p></reply>

The problem of overcrowding in hospitals requires a full system, patient focused response. Recognising this, in the Winter Plan, the HSE sought to maximise the use of existing resources across hospital groups and CHOs and to target additional investment at both hospital and community services and supports. </p><p>The range and prioritisation of measures was a matter for UHL and CHO Mid-West. Key measures included:</p><p>- additional home support packages and transitional care beds to support people to leave the hospital and return home</p><p>- extended opening hours in the AMAU;</p><p>- opening of a surgical short stay unit;</p><p>- additional access to diagnostics. </p><p>The NTPF has established a fund of &euro;1m that will support the HSE Winter plans with a focus on increasing access to diagnostics in both private facilities and in-house. 6,050 vouchers had been issued to Emergency Departments for diagnostics as of 31 March 2019, including 1,050 vouchers issued to UHL.</p><p>It is widely agreed that a key part of the solution for Limerick is additional beds. Over the past 18 months, an additional 25 beds have opened in Limerick, including 8 as part of this year's Winter Plan. </p><p>A capital allocation of &euro;2 million has been granted in recent weeks and the HSE advises that this will facilitate the completion of enabling works for the 60-bed modular ward in 2019. </p><p>In addition, the National Development Plan includes a 96-bed replacement ward block in Limerick and capital funding was provided in 2018 to progress the design phase of this project.</p><p>The performance and governance of services in UHL and in the region is a matter for the Hospital Group, CHO Midwest and the HSE. The performance of Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisation is considered by the HSE in line with the Performance and Accountability Framework, which provides for escalation and a range of actions.  </p><p>I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to closed beds in the region and on the actions that are being taken to maximise the use of existing resources in UL Hospital Group and CHO 3 to reduce overcrowding. </p></reply>

The first round of the Fund was distributed through Local Community Development Committees, Children and Young Person&rsquo;s Services Committees and statutory organisations.  The aim of the Fund is to support innovative, cross sectoral, evidence-based projects, programmes and initiatives that support the implementation of key national policies in areas such as Obesity, Healthy Eating, Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity and Sexual Health. The Fund is primarily administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department.</p>  <p>  A range of community cooking  and nutrition programmes have been funded by the Healthy Ireland Fund through allocations to Local Community Development Committees and Children and Young People's Services Committees.

Healthy Ireland is based on evidence and experience from around the world which clearly shows that to create positive changes in health and well-being takes the involvement of the whole of Government and all of society working in unison.  There are a number of Health Promotion policies and programmes that fall under the scope of the Healthy Ireland Framework that are being implemented in the Health Services and across several Government Departments, Agencies and settings.  A central aim of Healthy Ireland is to &lsquo;create an environment where every individual and sector of society can play their part in achieving a healthy Ireland&rdquo;.  It is therefore extremely difficult to classify and specifically quantify the funding that is being earmarked for each programme and to give an indication if an evaluation has taken place for each over the previous five years.</p>  <p>  However, I can give the Deputy information relating to Funds expended by the Department of Health on health promotion programmes.  In July 2016, the Government approved the creation of a Healthy Ireland Fund and subsequently provided an initial allocation of &euro;5 million in Budget 2017 to kick-start the establishment of the Fund.  The Fund has distributed &euro;10mil from my Department in 2017 and 2018 to all Local Community Development Committees, Children and Young Persons Services Committees and several national statutory organisations for the promotion of health and well-being activity.  A further &euro;5mil will be distributed in 2019.  The aim of the Healthy Ireland Fund is to stimulate and support innovative, cross-sectoral, evidence-based projects, programmes and initiatives that support the implementation of the key national policies in areas such as Obesity, Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity, Healthy Eating and Sexual Health at a local level.   In 2017, the results of the first year of the Healthy Ireland Fund have been very encouraging, especially in relation to the targeting of socially disadvantaged communities.  Of the 382 actions delivered under strand 1, 2,456 organisations were reported to be involved in the implementation of local priority actions and an estimated 770,000 people were reported to have benefitted.  These actions generally targeted health inequality, especially people living in areas of social disadvantage (71% of actions), people with disabilities (45%), people from new communities including refugees and asylum seekers (39%) and members of the Traveller community (36%). Similarly, the total number of people reported as benefiting from national actions under Strand 2 was 130,735. The number of organisations benefiting was reported as 1,785, and almost two thirds of actions (63%) reported a focus on people with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses (including mental health issues) and over half of actions (54%) were focused on people living in areas of social disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding and resources for health promotion programmes under Healthy Ireland and I therefore will refer this PQ to them for further response.</p></reply>

Accordingly, if the person concerned wishes to make an internal report under Section 6 of the Act, they are advised to consult these procedures for information as to how to do so. As an employee of a public body, they can also make their disclosure to the Minister for Health under Section 8 of the Act. Furthermore, a public disclosure can be made under Section 10, if the conditions of that section of the Act are met.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to the NMBI, the Nurses and Midwives Act, 2011 sets out the circumstances under which I may remove a member of the Board from office.</p></reply>

The rules and regulations of this Scheme are solely the responsibility of my Department and, as a result, I have had no contact with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the issue raised by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  The Scheme ensures primarily that fallen bovine animals over 48 months, which must be BSE-tested in accordance with EU legislation, are disposed of in compliance with all animal and public health and environmental regulations. </p>  <p>  A review of the Fallen Animal TSE Subsidy Scheme was undertaken in 2013, in consultation with stakeholders. This review took into account TSE testing requirements, Animal By-Product (ABP) regulations, budgetary considerations, the need to maintain competition and the need for an adequate collection and disposal infrastructure including the availability of adequate rendering capacity especially in the event of a serious (Class A) disease outbreak. </p>  <p>  A number of changes were introduced to the collection of fallen animals under the scheme in 2013. Those included enhanced compliance provisions and putting limits on the distance material can be transported while maintaining a competitive aspect to the market. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the scheme the haulage distance for material to which the scheme applies from the intermediate plant (knackery) to rendering plant shall not exceed 125kms radius unless with the prior approval of my Department.  The scheme also provides that, where there are not two or more rendering premises inside 125kms radius from the intermediate plant, then delivery is permitted to either of the two nearest rendering premises as measured by road. </p>  <p>  An operator is free to dispose of animals not eligible under the Fallen Animal TSE Subsidy Scheme to a licensed plant of his choice and the arrangements made are a commercial matter between them.</p></reply>

Eligible land must be maintained in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation without preparatory action going beyond the usual agricultural methods and machineries. There must be an agricultural activity carried out in the parcel as abandoned land is not eligible for payment. Payment under other area-based schemes, e.g. Area of Natural Constraints (ANC), is also based on the land declared being deemed as eligible land.</p>  <p>   The presence of suitable fencing is just one of the criteria that can be used to determine whether or not land is being maintained in an eligible condition and that there is an agricultural activity in the parcel.  The absence of suitable fencing, particularly on marginal type land, may indicate that grazing livestock are not being controlled in a manner to satisfy the maintenance requirement of an &ldquo;eligible hectare&rdquo;. The 2019 BPS Terms and Conditions provide clarification with regard to fencing. There has been no change in the rules on the eligibility of land, rather further clarification has been provided on the matter of fencing of land. Where parcels have been deemed ineligible in the past, the assessment was similar to the current assessment.</p>  <p>   A decision on whether or not a parcel of land is eligible for payment will include an assessment of suitability for use for agricultural purposes, state of the vegetation and evidence of parcel use e.g. grazing.  Appropriate fencing was, and continues to be, an indicator that a parcel is being managed and maintained in an eligible state.</p>  <p>   There is a comprehensive independent appeals process in place, whereby any applicant may seek an appeal of a decision affecting his/her farm payments.   If the Deputy has a specific case on which he wishes to receive further clarification, this will be provided on receipt of the details of the case in question.</p></reply>

On the one hand, the EU has created the appropriate legal framework in a no-deal Brexit situation to allow UK vessels reciprocal access to EU waters throughout 2019, if the UK grants such access to EU vessels in its waters. On the other hand, the EU has also adjusted the eligibility criteria of the Fisheries and Maritime Fund, to ensure that fishermen who have to cease their activities &ndash; in case the UK does not grant continued access to its waters &ndash; can receive compensation. In such a case, it would be essential that Member States adopt a coordinated approach to ensure a level-playing field between EU fishermen in different Member States and to protect marine resources. </p>  <p>   The Communication sets down the preparations in the EU, agreed with the eight Member States directly impacted, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  It identifies the need for mitigation measures and in particular compensation for temporary tie up of fishing vessels.  It gives the EU Commission a strong co-ordination role.  </p>  <p>   This communication reflects the high level of planning by Ireland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden working closely with DG Mare.  When I met Commissioner Vella last February, I emphasised the real risks of a concentration of fishing into  Ireland&rsquo;s 200 miles fishing zone by EU fleets if they  are excluded from UK waters. I pointed out that inevitably this would lead to displacement of our own fleet and depletion of fish stocks if no action is taken.</p>  <p>   I stressed to the Commissioner the need for a European approach to addressing this issue and agreed with him that the key Member States and DG Mare needed to put in place a contingency plan.  I have been working intensively over recent weeks, and have kept the fishing industry informed of the work to ensure that we are ready for this worst case situation, while always hoping that we will never need to call upon these plans.</p>  <p>   We now have identified and agreed, co-ordinated and fully prepared measures that will be immediately available to address a no-deal Brexit situation, if the UK were to decide to deny EU vessels access to UK waters.  I am seeking additional EU funds to support this mitigation measure if they become necessary. If we need to call on these arrangements, it will be essential, as we have now agreed at EU level, that all involved EU fleets must co-operate under these structured arrangements to manage the situation. These arrangements facilitate a European response to the situation with the objective that the Irish  fleet would not be disproportionately impacted ensuring that each Member State impacted would take a fair share of the pain.</p></reply>

On the one hand, the EU has created the appropriate legal framework in a no-Deal Brexit situation to allow UK vessels reciprocal access to EU waters throughout 2019, if the UK grants such access to EU vessels in its waters.

I have stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the impact on the sector, including through traditional EU market supports and exceptional aid provisions under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, as well as through increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.  Commissioner Hogan has confirmed that the EU is ready to respond positively, and my officials remain in regular contact with Commission officials in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting on 18 March was an important opportunity to highlight to the Council, the Commission and to my fellow Ministers, the impacts of a no-deal Brexit on the agrifood sector in Ireland and the potential knock-on effects across the EU market as a whole.  During the discussion on the meat market, I outlined the exposure of the Irish beef sector in particular and called for the full suite of measures available under the Common Market Organisation, including targeted support for farmers, to be deployed rapidly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I also referred to the need to protect the EU beef sector in trade discussions with Mercosur, against the background of the significant uncertainty arising from Brexit.  In addition, I highlighted the exposure of the Irish fisheries sector, and the need for careful joint EU management of fisheries resources, as well as financial supports for fishermen and their communities.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week, at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg, I followed up these efforts with a further call for acknowledgment of the impact of Brexit on the beef sector through the making available of exceptional aid for the sector, despite the avoidance of a hard Brexit on 12 April.</p>  <p>  With regard to State Aid, I welcome the recent announcement by the European Commission, with effect from 14 March 2019, that the maximum threshold limits under the agriculture de minimis regulation will increase.  Under the revised rules, aid of up to &euro;20,000 can be paid to a beneficiary on a rolling three year basis i.e. the current fiscal year and the two previous fiscal years.  Once a beneficiary has reached this limit they may not receive any further aid in excess of this limit under de minimis rules within the rolling time period.</p>  <p>  In order to avoid any potential distortion of competition, each EU Member State has a maximum national limit, which they cannot exceed.  Under the revised rules, Member States' national ceiling is increased to 1.25% of their annual agricultural output over the same three-year period.  This represents a 25% increase in the national ceiling.</p>  <p>  The revised rules permit a Member State to increase the individual de minimis aid limit up to &euro;25,000, once the Member State does not spend more than 50% of its total national aid envelope on one particular agricultural sector.  In these circumstances, the national limit is increased to 1.5% of the annual output.  This represents a 66% increase in the ceiling per farmer and a 50% increase in the national ceiling.</p>  <p>  This increase in threshold of de minimis aid will allow for greater flexibility and efficiency, notably in times of crisis and situations demanding a swift response by the public authorities.</p>  <p>  I have said that the State will not be found wanting when it comes to supporting the Irish agrifood sector and farmers to deal with the impact of Brexit.  The increase in the agriculture de minimis limits is a very important first step in this regard.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, working in close co-operation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland, has received approval from the EU Commission for an Irish state aid application, allowing an Irish company to receive state aid funding for the diversification of its activities. The potential for this approval to act as a template for assistance for agrifood enterprises and exporters within state aid rules and regulations is currently being examined.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the establishment of other digital hubs and my Department does not have a list of the digital hubs operating throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The DHDA offers digital companies flexible property solutions, facilities, and technology transfer with peer-to-peer collaboration within the wider digital sector. To date, over 375 digital companies have progressed through the enterprise cluster generating more than 2,000 jobs during their time at the Hub. There are currently 71 digital media companies employing 660 full time staff located in the Digital Hub. The DHDA also runs a number of digital and technology Community learning initiatives.</p>  <p>  An initial investment of approximately &euro;74 million was made by the State for circa nine acres in the Thomas Street area to provide accommodation for digital enterprises and related activities of the Hub. The Agency&rsquo;s property portfolio consists primarily of protected structures, including vacant and derelict buildings which must be maintained pending their redevelopment. Over 50% of the campus has been developed and there are currently nine properties available to let to digital enterprises.</p>  <p>  The DHDA currently meets its running costs through a combination of its commercial income and Exchequer funding. From 2003 to date the Agency has received Exchequer subventions of approximately &euro;31.4m to assist it meeting its operating and capital expenditure costs. The aim of the Agency is to fulfil its functions from its commercial income and to ultimately remove its reliance on Exchequer funding. </p></reply>

In addition there are public chargers provided by local authorities, retail outlets and private companies. </p>  <p>  Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. This project successfully completed the assessment stage and the validation stage is now underway. </p>  <p>  The project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models. This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.</p>  <p>  The locations of the chargers has not been finalised. However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by ESB eCars and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. ESB eCars is currently identifying the most appropriate locations for the chargers to be sited. The sites will be identified using the latest software mapping techniques, taking account of information on current charge point usage, traffic volume, accessibility, amenities and grid capacity at the sites. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the SEAI, is also working on how best to support the provision of greater levels of on-street public charging.</p></reply>

This has included the significant development and growth of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). The response team within the NCSC gained international accreditation in 2017.</p>  <p>  The NCSC works with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces and other Departments and State Agencies in relation to the security of IT infrastructure and critical national infrastructure. The operational details of these activities are not made public for security reasons</p>  <p>  Moreover, since the transposition of the EU Network and Information Security Directive last year, the NCSC has a series of formal powers around the security of a range of critical national infrastructure, including a set of binding security requirements and an incident reporting requirement. </p>  <p>  My Department is leading in the development of a new National Cyber Security Strategy and chairs a Steering Group with representation across a number of Government Departments. A public consultation on the Strategy was launched on 19 March 2019 and will remain open until 1 May. This public consultation poses a series of questions around how we might better (1) protect critical national Infrastructure and services from Cyber Security related risks, (2) develop our skills base and industrial capacity in this field, and (3) engage nationally and internationally on cyber security matters, both to build awareness and to ensure that our international policy position takes cognisance of developments in cyber security. My Department has also established 5 expert stakeholder groups to comment on the various aspects of cyber security policy to ensure that the Strategy process is fully informed by a mix of public, private sector and academic expertise. These groups have already met once, and will meet again after the public consultation phase is completed. The new strategy will be in place mid-year.   </p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest.</p><p>According to my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map, 30,856 or 79% of premises in the constituency of South Kildare now have access to high speed broadband.  This represents an increase of 13 percentage points since April 2017, when eir began its deployment of high speed broadband to some 300,000 rural premises.  This deployment will deliver access to a high speed broadband service to a further 1%, or 400 premises.  The remaining 7,811, or 20%, of homes, schools and businesses in Kildare South will be connected under the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan State Intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan.  The Map is colour coded and searchable by address or Eircode. </p><p>The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage.  I will bring a recommendation to Government as soon as possible. </p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through Local Authority Broadband Officers is continuing.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) which included the SCP was transferred to my Department on its establishment in 2011. Operational responsibility for the SCP was transferred to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency on its establishment in 2014.</p>  <p>  Currently, SCP receives annual funding of 24.7 million. My Department works with the Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of Tusla to ensure necessary resources are available to support this programme and to ensure staffing levels are sufficient to deliver a high quality service to those young people most at risk of early school leaving. </p>  <p>  From the Programme&rsquo;s inception under the Department of Education and Skills up to &euro;5,000 per annum was allowed for therapeutic supports for crisis or emergency needs as they arose for SCP participants. This recognised that many of the SCP participants experience adversity in their lives. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the SCP does not have a responsibility for funding school counsellors and therapeutic services. The SCP funding for school counsellors and therapeutic services were to be provided only in emergency or crisis cases for SCP participants. </p>  <p>  Tusla (EWS) has advised me that they have  reviewed the SCP plans submitted by the SCP project which works in Ladyswell and Corduff National Schools and there is no record of the employment of a school counsellor  in plans submitted to Tusla for 2018/19 or in previous years. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with Tusla (EWS) to ensure necessary resources are available to support the SCP programme. In recognition of the need for a strong policy platform for educational welfare services, including the School Completion Programme, I have requested my officials to establish a Task Group to support the further development and integration of these services. The work of this group is near completion and I am eager to ensure that output will result in a clear blueprint for the development of the three strands of the EWS, including the SCP so that its reach, resources and impact are maximised in supporting young people at risk of early school leaving. </p></reply>

The allocation includes a current provision of &euro;1.478 billion and a capital allocation of &euro;32 million. </p>  <p>  At the end of March, 2019, the sum of &euro;430 million has been expended from my Department&rsquo;s current provision and &euro;1.7 million from the capital allocation, representing 29% of gross allocation.  </p>  <p>  Just over half of my Department&rsquo;s funding is targeted at services within Tusla, the Child and Family Agency to protect our children and to provide for their welfare. Tusla will receive additional funding of &euro;31 million in 2019 bringing its overall allocation to &euro;785 million.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;59 million is being provided for early learning and care programmes in 2019 which will bring early learning and care funding to just under &euro;575 million. Children, parents and providers are all set to benefit. The increased resource allows me to continue to meet the growing demand for universal and targeted supports. It also enables me to widen the thresholds of the new National Childcare Scheme that I will introduce later this year.</p>  <p>  In addition to these areas, my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2019 contains provision for almost &euro;63.6 million for Youth Services. These resources will fund youth services throughout the country, including services for those at risk of disadvantage and help address some of the remaining challenges faced by LGBTI+ young people. </p>  <p>  Other key areas of expenditure include &euro;26 million for the costs of Irish Youth Justice Service, including operational costs for the Oberstown Children Detention Centre; &euro;19 million for the operational costs of my own Department; &euro;9.5 million for Prevention and Early Intervention Programmes (which now includes the Area Based Childhood Programme and the PPFS Programme); &euro;7 million for the Intervention Programme for Children and Young People; &euro;5 million for the Adoption Authority of Ireland; &euro;4 million for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes; and just under &euro;3 million for the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. </p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;2.098 million in 2019 is being made by my Department to support the development of youth projects under the Peace IV 2014 - 2020 Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  This Programme is a cross border initiative funded by the EU, the Irish government and the North Ireland assembly, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB). It is designed to support peace and reconciliation through youth work in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland. The Children &amp;amp; Young People programme under Peace IV targets those young people aged between 14-24 years who are disadvantaged, excluded or marginalised, have deep social and emotional needs, and are at risk of becoming involved in anti-social behaviour, violence or dissident activity. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the significant additional resources secured for 2019 will enable my Department and its agencies build on the good work achieved to date. The extra funding continues this Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide high quality services for children and young people.</p></reply>

Of this, &euro;6.1 million has been allocated for the 2019 Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare Capital programmes.</p><p>This funding will be delivered in three strands, as follows:</p><p>&euro;4.23 million will be available under Strand A, which will offer grants of up to &euro;50,000 to early learning and care providers for the creation of new places for 0-3 year-olds where demand for these is clearly evidenced.</p><p>&euro;875,000 has been allocated to Strand B, which will offer individual grants of up to &euro;15,000 to aid community/not-for-profit early learning and care services in addressing fire safety issues.</p><p>Finally there will be &euro;1 million for Strand C, which will offer individual grants of up to &euro;20,000 to school age childcare providers for the creation of new school age places where demand for these is clearly demonstrated.</p><p>The application window for the Early Learning and Care and School Age Capital programmes opened on 25 February and closed on 27 March 2019. Applications are now in the middle of the appraisal stage, which is undertaken by Pobal and overseen by my Department.</p><p>Applications are being appraised using a fair process, based on a number of criteria, including:  Demonstration of need; Value For Money; Capacity of the organisation (including compliance with scheme rules); Project Achievability, and Socio-economic deprivation in the service's location.</p><p>Capital programmes are necessarily a budget limited exercise. The maximum grant size available under each of these strands has been determined to optimise what can be delivered by each individual grant, and to maximise the number of providers and children who will ultimately benefit from the funding.</p><p>Decisions on the award of capital grants are due to be delivered in June 2019 , once the appraisal process has concluded.</p><p>Furthermore, childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan (2018-2027) and &euro;250 million in capital funding was secured for childcare under the plan. This represents the kind of large scale investment in the sector by the State that has not been undertaken since the earlier National Childcare Investment Programme that concluded in 2010.</p><p>This investment will be essential to respond to the increased capacity we expect as the new National Childcare Scheme is introduced. The NCS will radically change how this country supports the cost of early learning and care and school age childcare.</p><p>Research is on-going to determine areas of specific need that the NDP funding will address when it comes on stream in the coming years. The exact shape and priorities of this funding is currently being developed: more information will be made public on childcare plans under the NDP as it becomes available.</p></reply>

This causes a delay in having final figures for some areas. The Department has written to the LCDC in each area asking for confirmation of final amounts provided to community groups and will provide this to the Deputy when it is available.

Participant landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken, in line with agreed work plans.</p>  <p>  The scheme currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 landholders to maintain those trails. Payments are based on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s "Own Labour Rate".  In line with this rate, my Department has increased the amount payable to participants from &euro;12.40 per hour to &euro;13.50 per hour from 1 January this year.  This increase will be reflected in payments made to participants this year.  </p>  <p>  The maximum amount payable to any participant is 200 hours, or &euro;2,700. In 2018, the average payment to participants on the scheme was &euro;938.  The cost of payments to participants on an annual basis is in the region of &euro;2 million.  A further &euro;600,000 is paid to Local Development Companies to cover the cost of administering the scheme and the salaries of Rural Recreation Officers who oversee the scheme.</p></reply>

This was an ambitious target, particularly during a time of economic recession, but one to which the Government remained committed.</p>  <p>   Data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) show that consistent poverty rose sharply from the 2010 level, to a peak of 9.0% in 2013.  However the most recent SILC data from 2017 show that this had reduced to 6.7%.  While this is a welcome decrease, a reduction of over 4 percentage points will now be required to meet the 2020 poverty target of 2%.</p>  <p>   There are two other components of the National Social Target for Poverty Reduction:</p>  <p>  (i)  The Irish contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target: to reduce by a minimum of 200,000 the population in 'combined poverty' (i.e. those in consistent poverty or at-risk-of-poverty or experiencing basic deprivation) between 2010 and 2020.</p>  <p>  The population affected by &lsquo;combined poverty&rsquo; was 27.8 per cent in 2017, compared to 29 per cent in 2016.  Nominally, this equated to 1.33 million people and represents a decrease of 80,000 people on the 2010 baseline figure.  Thus, over 120,000 people will have to be lifted out of combined poverty by 2020 to meet the Europe 2020 target.  It should be noted that this rate increased to 1.74 million people in 2013 compared to the 1.4 million 2010 baseline figures and thus the current rate represents a decrease of nearly 400,000 people on the 2013 rate.</p>  <p>  (ii)  The child-specific poverty target:  to lift over 70,000 children (aged 0-17 years) out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.</p>  <p>  The number of children in consistent poverty rose significantly from the 2011 baseline figure of 107,000 to a high of 152,000 in 2014.  The 2017 SILC data indicate that there were 105,000 children in consistent poverty in 2017, a decrease of 25,000 children on 2016.  This means that a revised figure of 68,000 children have to be lifted out of consistent poverty to meet the target by 2020.</p>  <p>  Given the continuing economic recovery and measures introduced in Budgets 2018 and 2019, I expect the figures for 2018 and 2019, when they become available, to show further improvement over the 2017 outcomes.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.</p></reply>

This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;39.25 for the average household. </p><p>The Department is in the final stages of drafting the new Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy, which will assemble in one place the range of policy measures across Government Departments that are designed to address the different aspects of poverty and social exclusion.</p><p><b>Severe Material deprivation rate: household type - Single Person with dependent children</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>EU-28</td><td>17.1</td><td>18.4</td><td>21.6</td><td>20.7</td><td>19.2</td><td>17.1</td><td>15.7</td><td>13.3</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>12.8</td><td>23.3</td><td>27.4</td><td>32.3</td><td>25.1</td><td>22.6</td><td>23.2</td><td>17.9</td></tr></table>Source: EU-SILC Data</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Local authorities may facilitate the phased payment of contributions, such as when units are completed or when a stage is reached in the development. </p><p>In order to avoid inconsistencies in recognising income and the raising of invoices that would be unlikely to be collected in the near future, a pragmatic approach to accounting for income has been adopted. When a commencement notice is received, contributions collectable within the next 12 months are usually treated as income and a short-term debtor is raised. Those contributions not deemed collectable in the next 12 months are treated as deferred income, with potential debtors not collectable in the next 12 months being treated as long-term debtors. Deferred income is treated as a long-term creditor and is matched against Long-term development contribution debtors in the Annual Financial Statement (AFS).  This accounting treatment acknowledges that long-term debtors are not income in the current period, and they may or may not become due depending on the progress of the development and are thus deferred to future periods. </p><p>Local Authorities operate on an accrual accounting basis and recognise income and expenditure as incurred, regardless of the cash transactions. The AFS do not separately show the amount of cash on hand in relation to development contributions but instead show the amount of development contributions due to local authorities. </p><p>Appendix 5 of the amalgamated AFS shows a total income of &euro;211.5m for Development Contributions for the financial year ending 31/12/2017, which is the most recent year for which audited figures are available. The development contribution income for each local authority for 2017 is set out in the following table.  Note 5 of the AFS shows short term current debtors of &euro;293.2 m, gross of any bad debt provisions.</p><p>The reporting of long term development contribution debtors and deferred income in respect of development contributions was amended with effect from AFS 2016, meaning they are no longer shown separately (although the information continues to be recorded within the Local Authorities Financial Management Systems). The AFS does not separately report long-term debtors and deferred income but effectively nets these off. The rationale for this change was to address the misinterpretation of the data. Long-term development contribution debtors and deferred income were not being viewed together, leading to a misleading perception that significant long-term development contributions were due to local authorities.</p><p><table><tr><th>Local   Authority</th><th>2017<br /><br />&euro; </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>911,007 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council</td><td>730,685</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>1,398,498</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council</td><td>1,580,595</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>13,141,201</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td>1,304,931</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>55,631,274</td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council</td><td>25,522,953</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>41,071,965</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council</td><td>(889,267)</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>1,252,929</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>1,681,055</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>812,756</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>1,211,561</td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td>2,053,226</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td>458,584</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>3,102,386</td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council</td><td>(375,693)</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>4,739,599</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td>1,014,385</td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>11,812,633</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council</td><td>309,912</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>922,514</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td>827,106</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td>550,945</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>25,170,780</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council</td><td>2,132,744</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>2,339,566</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council</td><td>674,929</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td>3,008,844</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>7,463,736</td></tr><tr><td>Total income</td><td>211,568,609</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is made up of &euro;57 million exchequer funding, which is an increase of some 8% on the 2018 figure, with the balance of &euro;14.25 million coming from local authority resources.  Increasing funding to 2008 levels would cost an additional &euro;0.95 million made up of &euro;0.8 million from the Exchequer, with a further &euro;0.15 million to be contributed by the local authorities.</p><p>I am conscious of the social benefit accruing from the schemes, particularly in terms of facilitating older people and people with a disability to remain living independently in their own homes.  This is recognised in the Programme for Government and as a consequence, funding has been increasing year on year since 2014.  The Government's Housing Options for Our Ageing Population - Policy Statement (Actions 4.1/4.2) indicates a commitment to increase the funding for the Scheme, review the Scheme guidelines and streamline the Scheme's operation.  The Policy Statement is available on my Department's website at the following .</p><p>Over the course of each year, my Department works closely with all local authorities, to monitor spend and to achieve a full drawdown of the available funding. As the year progresses, any underspend is redistributed to those local authorities with high levels of grant activity who sought additional funding.</p></reply>

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard.  </p>  <p>  My Department has introduced the Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme in order to target newly built or yet to be built houses and apartments for long term leasing, and to target property developers and investors who are in a position to deliver housing at a reasonable scale in order to supplement delivery under Pillar 2 of Rebuilding Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The first call for proposals for the Enhanced Leasing Scheme was open from January to April 2018 and a total of 33 submissions were received.  The second call for proposals closed on 25th October 2018 and a total of 22 submissions were received.  Information with respect to the number and location of the dwellings proposed for leasing under the Scheme will be available once the respective housing authorities have signed Agreements for Lease arising from the completion of the due diligence process.  This due diligence process is currently underway and it is expected that the first Agreements to Lease will be signed later in Q2 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency continue to work with local authorities and proposers in respect of the Enhanced Leasing Scheme, and the leasing schemes generally, in order to ensure maximum delivery of high quality leased properties to meet the needs of households on social housing waiting lists.  To this end, the Enhanced Long-Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme is in full operation and accepting proposals, complementing the range of other delivery mechanisms operated by my Department.</p></reply>

While my Department has responsibility for the promotion of the Per Cent for Art Scheme, it does not have a budget for it.  My Department, therefore does not provide any funding for the inclusion of art projects in the project costs of other Departments' projects such as roads, schools or hospitals, and it does not collect statistics.</p>  <p>  The scheme does not operate on the basis of a specific public art fund from which moneys are drawn to undertake or to commission works of an artistic nature.  Rather, under the terms of the Scheme, such works are factored into and funded from the overall budget of each capital project by the public body undertaking it.  This is a matter for each project promoter or commissioning body and I, as Minister, have no statutory function in this regard.</p>  <p>  Guidelines on the Per Cent for Art Scheme are available on the Public Art website www.publicart.ie.  The guidelines set out how project managers are to operate the scheme and provide a common national approach to its implementation.  The Public Art website is also a comprehensive Public Art resource, which offers information on the operation of the scheme, as well as much of the output of the scheme.  This is continuously updated and includes almost 250 permanent and temporary, public and socially engaged artworks made in Ireland, or of artwork made by Irish artists abroad.  Many of these artworks were produced under the Per Cent for Art Scheme.</p>  <p>  I made a statement in relation to the per cent for art scheme at the Oireachtas Joint and Select Committees on Wednesday, 6 March 2019.  I informed the Select Committee of my intention to reform the per cent for art scheme and a proposal in that regard is currently under consideration.  The current review of the scheme  is looking at recommendations towards improvement of the retention and centralisation of collated information on projects under the scheme.</p></reply>
