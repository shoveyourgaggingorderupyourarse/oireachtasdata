The meeting was jointly chaired by the First Minister, Arlene Foster MLA, and the deputy First Minister, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill MLA. </p>  <p>  The meeting provided the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive the opportunity to exchange views on a wide range of issues of mutual interest and concern, including Covid 19, Brexit and the New Decade New Approach Agreement. </p>  <p>  There was a very positive discussion at the Council on areas of North South cooperation, including the progress being made in implementing NDNA commitments on North-South infrastructure projects. We also discussed the Government&rsquo;s establishment of the Shared Island Fund with &euro;500m in capital funding over the next five years, ring-fenced for investment in collaborative North/South projects.  In December, the Government approved &euro;6m in funding from the Shared Island Fund to launch the delivery of Phase 2 of the Ulster Canal and we are continuing to work in partnership with the Executive and through the North South Ministerial Council on the other cross-border investment projects, which are part of our Shared Island commitments in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Ministers noted that discussions on various New Decade New Approach commitments had taken place at NSMC Sectoral meetings and bi-laterally between Ministers and also noted the commitment of both Administrations to progress these projects which include the A5 Road, the restoration of the Ulster Canal, the Narrow Water Bridge, and the Sligo - Enniskillen Greenway.  </p>  <p>  The Council was briefed by the Chief Medical Officers, Dr Michael McBride and Dr Tony Holohan, on the public health situation and the ongoing close cooperation in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Ministers discussed the measures being implemented in the two jurisdictions to protect public health and limit the transmission of the virus. </p>  <p>  Ministers also discussed the impact of the pandemic on society and on the economy in both jurisdictions and welcomed the measures put in place by both Administrations to support communities and businesses affected by the crisis and to assist economic recovery. Progress in the development and roll-out of a vaccine was welcomed. </p>  <p>  The Council expressed its sympathy to all those who lost loved ones as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and commended the citizens in both jurisdictions for their compliance with the restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic and their efforts and perseverance in helping manage the outbreak. The NSMC also expressed its gratitude to all those who have participated in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly the frontline health and social care workers who have demonstrated commendable bravery, resilience and commitment to their work and expressed appreciation to the wider workforce of essential workers who have kept various services and facilities operational, often in challenging circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Council also discussed the all island implications of the UK leaving the European Union and agreed that engagement between both administrations on this matter should continue, both within the structure of the Council and elsewhere, taking account of the evolving position.</p></reply>

The <i>Building Blocks</i>Phase (6 months&rsquo; duration);</p><p>2. The <i>Launching </i>Phase (6 months&rsquo; duration);</p><p>3. The <i>Scaling</i>Phase (18 months&rsquo; duration); and</p><p>4. The <i>Consolidation</i>Phase (12 &ndash; 18 months&rsquo; duration currently envisaged).</p><p>The first two phases of <i>A Policing Service for our Future </i>(the <i>Building Blocks</i>and <i>Launching</i>Phases) have been completed and much has already been achieved. For example:</p><p>- The roll-out of a new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide;</p><p>- An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a Human Rights Unit and re-established the Strategic Human Rights Advisory Committee;</p><p>- The National Security Analysis Centre (NSAC) has been established; and</p><p>- The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2019 has been enacted which gives Garda&iacute; access to the Workplace Relations Commission for the first time and provides for a modern industrial relations framework within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>There has also been progress on legislative reform, in particular, legislation is being drafted relating to:</p><p>- the use of recording devices (including body worn cameras);</p><p>- the codification of legislation defining police powers of arrest, search and detention; and</p><p>- a new coherent framework for the governance and oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>These measures and achievements represent only some of the wide range of actions being progressed under APSFF.</p><p>Progress since early 2020 has been impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The third phase of the implementation of <i>A Policing Service for our Future </i>&ndash; the <i>Scaling </i>Phase &ndash; was originally scheduled to commence in early 2020. However, as the Scaling Phase was being finalised, a factor to be considered became COVID-19 and the response required. </p><p>I have been encouraged to see the responsiveness and flexibility shown by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with the demands of this unprecedented situation. </p><p>The third phase of <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>&ndash; the <i>Scaling </i>Phase &ndash; commenced in October 2020. This is the critical phase of the programme of reform, during which the programme gains momentum. The delivery of the majority of the actions will be started or executed during the<i>Scaling Phase. </i></p><p>The IGPR and PRIPO have been, and continue to be, actively engaged with key stakeholders to ensure continued momentum on reform, in so far as possible, in current circumstances. </p></reply>

This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across 38 different information campaigns.</p><p>The overall communications strategy for Covid-19 is based on a coordinated response that ensures maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community. This aligns with both World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasise the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. </p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals. </p><p>Campaigns have included Radio, newspaper and social elements.</p><p>Last Spring a number of campaigns were run as restrictions were imposed in order to explain the measures and to reinforce public health messages. Other Campaigns focussed on targeted sectors including the Business Sector, the postponement of the Leaving Certificate, the Return to Work Campaigns and Community Wellbeing.</p><p>In May the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopen Society and Business was published and a communications campaign was run to explain the different phases of the Roadmap.</p><p>During Summer 2020 the Jobs Stimulus was announced by the Government and a Campaign was run which was focussed on restoring confidence and investment in the recovery.</p><p>In Autumn Campaigns aimed at Community Wellbeing and Keeping Well and reinforcing public health messaging were run.</p><p>The AntiViral Campaign, launched in December, aims to engage with those aged 18-24, recognising that they have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Also in December, there were campaigns to inform citizens of the advice for having a safe Christmas with family and friends, and guidance on shopping safely, to reinforce public health messaging. </p><p>It is essential that citizens, business owners and communities are informed of the decisions being made by Government, and campaigns are developed and implemented to make the public aware of these decisions.</p><p>Campaigns have achieved impressive audience reach across all media platforms. The #AntiViral Campaign had over 5.7 million impressions by mid-December &ndash; we had communicated with over 300,000 young people approximately 5 times across the platforms building awareness of the Campaign. The AntiViral hashtag had over 1.1 million views and the Campaign&rsquo;s positive sentiment was measured at over 60%.</p><p>Data from 25 of the Campaigns advertised in National press show an average reach of 49%, with 17 of these reaching over 50%. The average readership for the 25 campaigns was 1.9 million (with 16 of the 25 campaigns having a readership of over 2 million). Readership figures for regional newspapers is over 1.5 million for each campaign.</p><p>Radio advertising had an average audience reach of 79%, with 19 of the campaigns advertised on radio reaching over 80%. </p><p>Digital display advertising was used in 13 campaigns, with a combined audience reach of over 33 million. This is an average of 2.6 million impressions, with six of the campaigns reaching over 3 million citizens.</p><p>Of 19 campaigns analysed that used Social media advertising, an average of 4.9 million impressions were achieved, with a high of 16.1 million impressions for the Publication of the Roadmap campaign.</p><p><b>Advertising Costs 2020</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Campaign</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1.

The Country is, at present, at Level 5 and within Level 5 people should work from home unless it is absolutely necessary to attend in person for the delivery of an essential service as listed on <i>www.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>I would stress, however, that, at this particular critical juncture, given the seriousness of the overall situation with COVID-19 cases across the Community and the resulting pressure on our hospital systems, it is vital that employers make provision for employees to work from home unless they are delivering an essential service and cannot work for home. </p><p>While an employer is responsible, in the first instance, for determining what work can be done remotely, employers and workers should seek to resolve any matters relating to remote working at a local level through mutual dialogue and engagement. </p><p>Where this is not possible a dispute may be referred to the State's workplace relations services for mediation or conciliation. The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is providing services on both a face to face and virtual basis.

This is Ireland&rsquo;s National Remote Work Strategy and sets out the path to making remote working a more permanent option in workplaces across Ireland after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed. Its actions will be progressed over the course of 2021 and includes commitments to legislate for the right to request remote working and new rules to allow employees the right to disconnect.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-27a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700058#WRA01900"><p>I believe the Deputy's question relates to the application and operation of the European Union's Safeguard Measures on steel, which have been in operation since July 2018. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, trade policy is a competence of the European Commission under Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and referred to as the Common Commercial Policy. Furthermore, Ireland as part of the EU's Customs territory must apply a common external tariff to goods coming into the EU's Single Market, and this includes any tariff measures designed to defend Union interests, when required, such as the Safeguard Measures.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Safeguard Measures for steel were initiated in July 2018 in response to the United States applying a 25% tariff on steel imports originating from 3rd countries, including the European Union. This action by the US resulted in steel originally destined for the US market being diverted to the European Union with the associated risk of flooding the EU market with steel products to the detriment of Union industry and producers.</p>  <p>  In response, the European Commission brought forward Safeguard Measures to manage the volume of steel entering the Single Market from 3rd countries. The measures currently in place were introduced in 2018 and allow for the importation of steel from 3rd countries - by way of quotas - in line with traditional volumes of trade in steel using the 2015-2017 reference period. Steel imports outside of the quotas are subject to a 25% tariff on landing in the EU. The current measures are due to expire at the end of June 2021. </p>  <p>Due to the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, as of 1st January 2021, the UK is no longer party to the EU&rsquo;s measures and the UK is now a 3rd country in relation to the application of the EU&rsquo;s safeguard measures. Under the EU&rsquo;s safeguards, the UK - now operating as a 3rd country - has been allocated its own specific quotas for the majority of the EU&rsquo;s 26 product categories subject to Safeguard Measures. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in anticipation of the UK&rsquo;s new status as a 3rd country, in September 2020, the UK Government issued a notice to state that it would establish its own set of Safeguard Measures and transition 19 of the 26 product categories subject of EU Safeguards from the 1st January 2021. The UK has also calculated its own quota levels for imports of steel products from 3rd countries, including the EU. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that safeguard measures are applied irrespective of whether there is a Free Trade Agreement in place with the 3rd country or not. The EU's range of Free Trade Agreements do not impact the uniform application of the Safeguard Measures. Irish importers can continue to import steel from the UK without the additional tariff of 25% if the volume of imports remain within the EU's quota allocations for the UK.  Imports from the UK to Ireland or other EU Member States in excess of those quotas will attract a 25% tariff. Similarly, imports of steel from other 3rd countries into Ireland would also be subject to a 25% tariff if the exporting country exceeds the available quota.</p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to the Deputy's reference to Northern Ireland, the interplay between the EU&rsquo;s safeguard measures and the application of the measures under the Northern Ireland Protocol is currently being carefully examined and officials in my Department and the Revenue are actively engaging with the European Commission on this matter with the view of finalising how measures should operate and apply in respect of Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that UK and EU steel can continue to be imported to NI tariff and quota free.  </p></reply>

While carrying out an inspection, the HSA inspector will examine the different work activities being carried out on the site along with the examination of operator training and maintenance of plant and lifting equipment on site, including Tower Cranes where applicable. </p>  <p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction Regulations) 2013 (S.I. No. 291 of 2013) require any person who operates a Tower Crane (with the exception of those in training) to be in possession of a SOLAS Construction Skills Certification (CSCS) Card for Tower Cranes. These Regulations also require any person (sometimes referred to as a banksman) involved in slinging/signalling operations, to be in possession of a SOLAS CSCS Card for slinging/signalling. </p>  <p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Applications) 2007 (S.I. No. 299 of 2007) require lifting equipment used on a construction site to be examined weekly by the user, as regards to the features related to its safe working. A record of the results of the examination must be kept in a suitable form and made available to an inspector where such records are requested. The General Application Regulations also require that fixed work equipment used for lifting loads is not taken into use for the first time, unless it has been tested and thoroughly examined by a competent person. A certificate of the test and examination specifying the safe working load must be in place and available for inspection. </p>  <p>  Inspectors carrying out inspections on construction sites, where tower cranes are present, will look for evidence of the required training for the Tower Crane Operator and Banksman. Inspectors will also look for evidence that the required safety inspections of the tower cranes have been carried out. </p>  <p>  In 2020 the HSA processed 62 complaints related to the use of cranes on construction sites &ndash; this figure relates to all crane types and is not limited to tower cranes.  Such complaints include general complaints from members of the public as well as complaints from employees.  Common topics emerging from these complaints included operation of cranes in windy conditions, slewing over property, safe working loads and questions relating to social distancing when using suspended personnel platforms/cages.  None of the complaints received by the HSA in 2020 have been identified as being raised by crane operators.  </p></reply>

No. 35 of 2016 entered into force on 30 April 2016. The Regulations apply to retailers and wholesalers of food and drink operating in Ireland, who have, or are part of a wider group that has, a worldwide turnover in excess of &euro;50 million.  21 undertakings are currently subject to the Grocery Goods Regulations for the reporting year 2019.</p>  <p>  The Regulations apply to written supply contracts which Relevant Grocery Goods Undertakings (RGGUs) have with their direct suppliers and require all the terms and conditions of the agreed contract to be expressed in clear intelligible language and signed by both parties to the contract. The Regulations specify those commercial practices which are prohibited unless the parties mutually agree them in writing in the contract. The Regulations specify the ways in which the RGGUs must comply with the legislation including filing their Annual Compliance Reports (ACRs) and maintaining relevant documentation for examination for 6 years after the end of the financial year in which the grocery goods contract was signed by the parties.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of the Grocery Goods Regulations. Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the Commission is independent in the performance of its statutory functions. As matters of compliance with the Regulations are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Commission, I, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, have no direct function in these matters.  </p>  <p>  However, I understand that the most recent ACRs received from the RGGUs by the CCPC have not raised any new or significant issues and follow-up on-site compliance inspections were conducted in 2020 (public health advice permitting).  The RGGUs deadline for submitting their ACRs for 2020 is 31 March 2021. </p></reply>

The legislation has been on the statute book for a number of years and given the changes in retail and trading environments, it was considered an opportune time to review the legislation. The consultation sought the views of interested parties, including local authorities, on matters relating to the Act.</p>  <p>  My Department engaged a legal researcher to examine the submissions received to the public consultation exercise and to prepare an options paper which would provide the basis for a policy review of the legislation. While this was completed last year, unfortunately it has not been possible to progress the review of the Act any further due to the necessity of pursuing other priorities and responding to demands arising in the context of Brexit and COVID-19. The matter will be reviewed in the second half of this year with a view to resuming work in earnest. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, local authorities are continuing to operate the provisions of the Casual Trading Act 1995 as before. </p></reply>

My Department has worked to ensure that appropriate financial supports are in place for businesses that require finance as they develop their response to their exposure to impacts arising from COVID-19. The uptake of the schemes and grants available has been robust and indicates that businesses are taking action in response to this period of disruption.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 also provides a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help self-employed and vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors, including second line supply businesses. We are providing for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include repayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme funds owed by employers and preliminary tax obligations for adversely affected businesses. </p>  <p>  To ensure that all self-employed taxpayers can benefit from the losses provision introduced in the July Stimulus, we are also providing that debt warehousing provisions be extended to include the 2019 balance and 2020 preliminary tax to allow such taxpayers to defer payment for a period of a year with no interest applying. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance is also delivering on the Programme for Government commitment to equalise the Earned Income Credit with the PAYE credit by raising it by &euro;150 to &euro;1,650. </p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the July Stimulus of enterprise measures, which includes the Wage Subsidy Scheme extended through 2021, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst second line support businesses.  COVID-19 Business Loans up to &euro;25,000 are available through Microfinance Ireland. The loans can range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000. </p>  <p>  Bord Bia is providing a range of supports for impacted food business, including an information hub; training supports; and the introduction of the &euro;1m COVID-19 Response Marketing Package for businesses to accelerate eCommerce and expand marketing activities in the context of rapidly changing trading conditions. Bord Bia continues to support quality assured Irish produce through promotion campaigns and is also supporting food companies to re-orient their produce to meet the needs of retail customers, and to explore any import substitution opportunities. My colleague, Charlie McConalogue, TD, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, may be able to provide more specific guidance on supports for the second line food supply businesses.</p>  <p>  I'm aware that some businesses are not able to access CRSS and might be falling between the stools. I have asked my officials to work with the Department of Finance and other Departments to identify the type and number of businesses that fall outside the scope of CRSS and are not covered by other sectoral schemes, and to report back to me with proposals on how we could amend CRSS or develop a new scheme for those companies.</p></reply>

I fully appreciate how difficult the situation is for those involved and their families.</p><p>While the Government cannot interfere with the High Court-overseen liquidation process, it has always sought to ensure that the concerns of workers are heard, and that the State&rsquo;s welfare, employment and training services are responding to the needs of the ex-Debenhams workers.</p><p>The State has always guaranteed statutory employment rights to the workers, including statutory redundancy. This right has been honoured by the State at a cost of over &euro;13m.  </p><p>The talks facilitated by the Chair of the Labour Court, Kevin Foley, concluded in December. In recognition of the exceptional circumstances of this case, as reflected in Kevin Foley&rsquo;s report, the Government said it was willing to allocate a fund of &euro;3 million to support career guidance, training, education and business start-ups for the former Debenham workers.</p><p>On 13 January, the ex-Debenhams workers voted to reject this proposal. I understand that the ex-Debenhams workers are disappointed that their expectations cannot be met.</p><p>At this stage, it appears that all avenues have been explored and exhausted and the Government awaits the outcome of the High Court process.</p></reply>

My Department has been to the forefront of the response to Covid-19 to develop appropriate measures to cushion the impacts of the pandemic on enterprises, workers and consumers.</p><p>In 2020 my Department secured an unprecedented increase of almost &euro;1 billion in additional funding as part of the Government&rsquo;s immediate response to the pandemic. This additional funding allowed the Department and our Enterprise Agencies to roll out a range of vital measures to assist businesses to survive the impact of Covid-19. These measures included the Restart Grant, the Online Retail Scheme, the Covid Products Scheme, Business Continuity Vouchers, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, the Covid Credit Guarantee Scheme and a range of other targeted initiatives.</p><p>Given the continuing economic impacts of Covid, Budget 2021 was framed to ensure that the necessary supports can continue to be accessed by businesses and workers. As well as providing over &euro;16 billion in additional funding to support the delivery of public services this year, the Budget also established a &euro;3.4 billion Recovery Fund for continuing the economic response to Covid and indeed Brexit.  </p><p>Insofar as my own Department is concerned, additional funding in the region of &euro;150 million was provided in Budget 2021 to fund our activities this year. The vast majority of this funding will be focussed on ensuring that the range of our Covid targeted capital supports such as the Covid Credit Guarantee Scheme, Future Growth Loan Scheme, Micro Finance Ireland Loan Scheme, Trading on Line Voucher Scheme can continue to be accessed by businesses. The additional current funding secured for the DETE Vote will also ensure that our Regulatory Agencies such as the Health and Safety Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the National Standards Authority of Ireland can continue to meet the very significant increase in demands that the pandemic has placed on them.</p><p>The Tables below sets out some detail of the additional funding provided to the Department&rsquo;s Agency Programmes in 2020 and 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>Subhead </th>       <th>Additional Amount (REV 2021) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A4 Intertrade Ireland </td>       <td>&euro;675k Capital </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A5 IDA </td>       <td>&euro;20m Capital + &euro;1m Current </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A6 NSAI </td>       <td>&euro;1.5m Current </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A7 EI </td>       <td>&euro;45m Capital + &euro;3.5m Current </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A8 LEO </td>       <td>&euro;6m Capital + &euro;1.3m Current </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A14 SBCI </td>       <td>&euro;14.325m Capital </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A15 MFI </td>       <td>&euro;5m Capital </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>B4 EI </td>       <td>&euro;5m Capital </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>C5 HSA </td>       <td>&euro;4.2m Current </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>C8 CCPC </td>       <td>&euro;2.9m Current </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition a further &euro;100m in funding will be provided as initial tranche of funding from the Recovery Fund to support enterprise as they battle the Covid challenge.  </p><p>The enterprise supports being provided by my Department are part of the Government&rsquo;s continued response to Covid including measures such as the EWSS, PUP, CRSS schemes.

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. There are currently over 7,000 homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.</p><p>A total of &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes in 2021. Of this amount, &euro;109 million is provided to support lower income households to retrofit their homes with &euro;100 million allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme.  This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy are set out in the table below. COVID-19 negatively impacted activity in 2020, particularly between March and June when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.

A research study, funded by the European Commission's Structure Reform Support Service was undertaken to inform the measures necessary to achieve this target and the total level of investment necessary. This study is currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  While my Department does not keep a register of public sector buildings, the work carried out as part of the research study estimates there are up to 15,000 public sector buildings in Ireland of which circa 82% are owned with the remainder rented. This figure includes schools and other buildings which are considered public sector buildings but may not necessarily be State owned. </p>  <p>  The study estimates that circa 8% of public sector buildings have a BER of at least B. This indicates that there are over 10,000 non-rented public sector buildings that will require an energy efficiency upgrade by 2030 in order to achieve the Government target.  </p>  <p>  The Public Sector Pathfinder Retrofit Programme, co-funded by my Department and administered by the SEAI, provides capital funding for energy retrofit building projects aimed at testing approaches and developing a model that can be replicated across the wider public sector. Since 2017, my Department has provided funding of over &euro;36 million which has supported energy upgrades in 280 buildings. Under Budget 2021, funding for the Programme has more than doubled to &euro;21 million from last year's Budget. I expect the level of exchequer funding for the retrofit of public sector buildings to increase further over the coming years. </p></reply>

As the transmission system operator EirGrid is responsible for the safe and secure operation of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system and has the experience and expertise necessary to manage the operation of the system ensuring that there has, to date, been no loss of supply to consumers due to the System Alerts.  The System Alerts are due to a combination of factors including: increased demand for electricity, low levels of wind generation, some power stations not being available to generate when needed, and pressures on the electricity system in Great Britain which limits the benefits of electricity interconnectors. In addition, Covid-19 has led to an increased demand from the residential sector  and has impacted the maintenance of some power stations reducing their availability at key times.  </p>  <p>  Increasing demand is a key factor taken into account in EirGrid's forward planning. The connection of new large energy users, such as data centres, is a key driver of electricity demand. EirGrid, in its Generation Capacity Statement 2020-2029, projects that demand from data centres could account for 27% of electricity demand by 2029.   </p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities and EirGrid are taking a range of actions to ensure adequate generation capacity is available to meet demand. These actions include capacity market auctions which incentivise the development of new generation capacity. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and EirGrid to ensure secure supplies of electricity to meet Ireland's needs. </p></reply>

According to the SEAI report, Energy in Ireland 2020, peat (excluding briquettes) accounted for 4.5% of household energy in 2019, whereas oil, electricity and natural gas are far more significant sources of household energy, collectively representing 85% of household energy. </p>  <p>  Domestic turf cutting is not considered to be a widely applicable approach to alleviating energy poverty at the national level.  The Minister for Social Protection provides a range of supports to alleviate energy poverty. These include a Fuel Allowance payment, of &euro;28.00 per week for 28 weeks, which is a total of &euro;784 each year, from October to April, to an average of 372,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;300 million in 2021. The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs. In addition, the Minister for Social Protection also provides an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;265 million in 2021. This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.</p>  <p>  Improving the energy efficiency of a home can protect households from energy poverty. I have provided funding to the SEAI to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 142,000 households have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The 2021 budget for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes is &euro;109 million with &euro;100 million allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. &euro;20 million in revenues from the carbon tax has also been allocated to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to pilot an aggregated delivery of retrofitting in the Midlands.  &euro;65 million has also been provided from the exchequer to that Department to retrofit local authority homes.   </p>  <p>  Protections are also in place for those falling into difficulty with their energy bills.  The CRU requires all electricity and gas suppliers to maintain a Code of Practice for Vulnerable Customers. This ensures that vulnerable customers cannot have their supply disconnected. It also ensures that people who are engaging with their supplier in relation to difficulties in paying their bills cannot be disconnected. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme. This scheme is administered by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and was established in 2011 for active domestic turf cutters arising from the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation and was extended in 2014 to include raised bog natural heritage areas. This scheme is applicable to turf cutters who have been affected by the designation of raised bogs as special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas and who fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme. It is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with payment of &euro;500 on the signing of a legal agreement under the scheme.  There are in the region of 2,600 qualifying applicants in the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme. Over 25,000 payments have been made under the scheme, to date, amounting to &euro;37 million.  1,215 deliveries of turf have been made at a cost of just over &euro;2.45 million.</p></reply>

In April of last year, all major telecommunications providers in Ireland committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, a number of operators have implemented further supports for consumers, such as for students in education, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many existing packages and by the introduction of new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. As a result, the market for mobile packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive, which is a positive development for consumers.</p>  <p>  Operators have committed to engaging with any customer that contacts them who is in financial difficulty as a result of COVID-19 and has difficulty paying their bills to agree the best way of keeping them connected to voice and data.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs. In addition, the Minister for Social Protection also provides an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;265 million in 2021.

This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.   </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date.   </p>  <p>  NBI has established a dedicated team to investigate acceleration of the rollout from its current contracted schedule of seven years. All possible alternative network providers are being considered and substantial work has been completed by this team to date with further actions scheduled over the coming months. This includes an assessment of the potential to utilise the ESB Network for certain areas and this work is on-going. The technical feasibility of whether the ESB network is compatible with the NBI solution has been the primary focus and NBI has undertaken site surveys and developed a detailed design for a pilot area using the ESB network, with the aim of establishing from this pilot exercise, the feasibility of using the ESB infrastructure on a broader basis</p>  <p>  Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. </p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 15 January 2021, over 161,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. In County Kerry, surveys have been completed in townlands around Killarney including Muckross, Fossa, Kilcummin, Lissivigeen, Ballycasheen, Faha, Firies and Ballyhar and in townlands around Tralee such as Curraheen, Abbeydorney, Kilflynn, Firies, Castlemaine and Ardfert. Further details are available on specific areas within County Kerry through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie</i>. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.  As of 10 January, 243 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  BCP&rsquo;s installed in Kerry are Gneeveguilla  (Tureencahill),  Railway Station Heritage Centre and Community Space, KilleenaghKillenagh, Kielduff Community Centre and  Cill&iacute;n Liath.  BCPs at  Cable Sation and Chapeltown are installed and connected. Further details can be found at <i></i>. </p><p>Boheeshil National School, Dunloe Upper and Coars National School are installed by NBI as part of this initiative.  School BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband for educational use and more than 70 schools will have been connected by the end of January through &lsquo;service provider' contracts managed by the Department of Education. An acceleration of the Schools Broadband Connection Points as part of the overall NBP was announced late last year which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP. Further details are available on the NBI website at <i></i>. </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  </p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 15 January 2021, over 161,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys in County Monaghan have been completed in Cornacassa, Cortolvin, Ballybay and Stranooden. Further details are available on specific areas within County Monaghan through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.  As of 10 January, 243 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Corduff Community Centre, Tannagh Outdoor Education Centre, Corcaghan Community Centre, Carn Resource Centre, Mullyash Community Centre and Monaghan GAA Centre of Excellence. BCP sites are installed and connected at Saint Alphonsus Community Hall, Ballybay Wetlands and Latton Resource Centre. Further details can be found at <i></i>. </p><p>I am advised that the BCP referred to in the Question that will be installed at Ballaghnagearn National School is part of the BCP schools initiative and will have a fixed wireless connection for an internal school network without any external points of access. It will therefore not be possible to use this access to facilitate other connections. </p><p>Annalitten, Drumgossatt and Saint Brigids National Schools are installed by NBI for educational access as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.

It will also help Ireland to move towards 70% renewable electricity, a commitment made in the Programme for Government. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers. </p>  <p>  Government does not have any role in the delivery of electricity infrastructure on the ground. This is consistent with  the 2012 Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure which states: &lsquo;The Government does not seek to direct EirGrid and ESB Networks or other energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies&rsquo;. The Kildare-Meath project is not comparable with the North South project, particularly in terms of distance.</p>  <p>  The option of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions.  Most recently and fully in line with the resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of 16 February 2017, my department commissioned an independent report incorporating international industry expertise to examine the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the north-south interconnector. The report from the International Expert Commission was published in October 2018 and it found that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this piece of critical electricity infrastructure. I do not intend ordering a further such review.</p>  <p>  EirGrid and ESB Networks, as our electricity system operators, always seek to work in close collaboration with landowners and stakeholders in the delivery of electricity infrastructure. Both companies are engaging with those living closest to the route of the interconnector. In that regard I note that EirGrid has already set in place a variety of engagements locally, including the appointment of community liaison officers and a mobile information unit active in the area. I expect such engagements to intensify in the coming weeks and months, subject of course to national public health guidelines on Covid-19.</p></reply>

The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows the areas which will be included in the National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led intervention as well as areas targeted by commercial operators. The map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. </p><p>&middot; Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high speed broadband through the State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). </p><p>&middot; The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>Design work on the National Broadband Plan is complete or ongoing in target townlands across every county in Ireland. I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 15 January 2021, over 161,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. In County Mayo surveys have been carried out across the townlands of Aghagower, Ballyhean, Breaghwy, Burren, Castlebar, Clogher, Cloonkeen, Croaghmoyle, Islandeady, Killavally, Manulla, Pontoon, Strade, Tawnynagry, Turlough, Drumsheen, Bunnyconnellan, Ballina Town, Carrowntreila, Ardagh, Campbells Crossroads, Rosserk, Shanvoley, Derryhick, Kilhale, Tawnylaheen, Turlough, Ballyvary, Keeloges, Castlebar Town, Rinnaseer, Bellaburke, Killawullaun Mountain, Carn, Carnacon, Ballyglass, Belcarra, Balla and Ringarraun. Further details are available on specific areas within County Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie</i>. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.  As of December 11 of January, 243 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. BCP&rsquo;s are connected in Mayo at Taugheen Community Centre, Killaser Community Centre, Bofeenaun Community Centre and Islandeady Community Centre. Further details can be found at <i></i>. </p><p>Scoil N&eacute;ifinn is  installed by NBI for educational access as part of this initiative. School BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband for educational use only through &lsquo;service provider' contracts managed by the Department of Education.

Further details are available on the NBI website at <i></i>. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. </p><p>NBI has established a dedicated team to investigate acceleration of the rollout from its current contracted schedule of seven years. All possible alternative network providers are being considered and substantial work has been completed by this team to date with further actions scheduled over the coming months. Part of this work includes an assessment of the potential to utilise the ESB Network for certain areas and this work is on-going. The technical feasibility of whether the ESB network is compatible with the NBI solution has been the primary focus and NBI has undertaken site surveys and developed a detailed design for a pilot area using the ESB network, with the aim of establishing from this pilot exercise, the feasibility of using the ESB infrastructure on a broader basis.</p><p>Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

SEAI retrofit schemes will form a crucial part of our approach to achieving these targets. Full details on the application processes for the range of schemes operated by the SEAI are available at <i>www.seai.ie</i>.</p><p>The Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  Revisits under this scheme are currently not available. This enables the work programme to prioritise eligible homes that have not previously received free upgrades under the scheme. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will be finalised shortly.</p><p>The Better Energy Homes scheme aims to improve energy efficiency by providing grant support for energy efficiency upgrades to homeowners whose homes were built prior to 2006. Under the scheme a home cannot receive grant funding twice for the same energy efficiency measure. The rationale for this policy in the case of wall insulation is that applying a second version of wall insulation to a home that has already received one form of wall insulation would result in a lesser amount of energy savings being delivered. </p><p>Under the Community Energy Grant Scheme and the National Home Retrofit (One Stop Shop Development) Scheme, grants may be claimed for additional measures to increase the energy efficiency of a home as part of an overall project to achieve a specified target. For example, external wall insulation can be supported in homes that previously received cavity wall insulation where it is determined that it is an appropriate intervention as part of an overall upgrade project to attain B2 or cost optimal and meet the minimum BER uplift.</p><p>It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer. The grant schemes provided by SEAI are however reviewed on a regular basis.</p></reply>

The map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. </p><p>- Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high speed broadband through the State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). </p><p>- The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>The Questions refer to premises located in the Amber area and one premises located in the Blue area. BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the NBP as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard. Notwithstanding this, our investigations show that the premises referred to in the BLUE area is located between the network coverage area of an eir exchange for copper based VDSL services and the start of a 300k ribbon. As a result, my Department has escalated the query with eir requesting them to clarify the availability of high speed broadband at the premises.</p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of 15 January 2021, over 161,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys in County Kerry have been completed in Townlands around Killarney including Muckross, Fossa, Kilcummin, Lissivigeen, Ballycasheen, Faha, Firies and Ballyhar, and in Townlands around Tralee including Curraheen, Abbeydorney, Kilflynn, Firies, Castlemaine and Ardfert. Further details are available on specific areas within County Kerry through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am aware that that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.

Further details can be found at <i></i>. </p><p>Boheeshil National School, Dunloe Upper and Coars National School are installed by NBI for educational access as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the intervention area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.

Where such impacts arose in 2020 and had financial impacts they were managed through the reallocation of resources within the Department's overall 2020 Vote allocations.  </p><p>Long-term budgetary planning for my Department is being undertaken in the context of the review of the National Development Plan (NDP), which is being managed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The purpose of the review to assess the adjustments to the National Development Plan needed to deliver the Programme for Government policy priorities in the context of the economic, social and environmental challenges faced by the country, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>  My Department is actively engaged in the process and is focused on ensuring that the level of investment needed to support the step change in ambition as set out in the Programme for Government is provided for. The Programme for Government sets out how we will respond and manage the challenge of decarbonising our economy and creating a sustainable future for all. The review of the NDP provides the opportunity to realise these commitments and to send a clear signal that Ireland is stepping up and taking on this challenge.</p><p>  The pandemic has highlighted the importance of good, reliable broadband to ensure that people across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where deliver of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working. The Government has also committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan and work to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of plan is continuing between my Department and NBI.</p><p>  The post-COVID economy will be more resilient if the recovery is sustainable, renewable and digital based. </p><p>  The information requested in relation to the State agencies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter for each agency.  The Department will request the relevant bodies to reply directly to the Deputy with the information requested in respect of their organisations.  </p></reply>

Small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators have been badly affected due to their dependence on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Limousine operators, who are particularly dependent on overseas tourism and major events, have suffered a near total drop in demand for their services and many have been simply unable to work since the pandemic started in March of last year. </p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports for businesses like these that are adversely affected by Covid.  These supports include wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports. Many SPSV operators, including limousine drivers, have been able to avail of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which remains open to new applicants. This payment continues to provide an important safety net to operators, recognising their dependency on other sectors of the economy, notably the hospitality industry.</p>  <p>  Limousine drivers are particularly dependent on the tourism industry. The 2021 Budget put in place a number of substantial measures to support and strengthen the tourism sector. The total funding for the tourism sector has increased in 2021 by over &euro;59 million or 36% over the initial 2020 allocation in Budget 2020 to &euro;220.9 million. Further details on these measures are available from my colleague, the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Catherine Martin T.D.</p>  <p>  Measures to support the SPSV industry have also been taken by the industry&rsquo;s statutory regulator, the National Transport Authority (NTA). These measures include the waiver of vehicle licencing fees for 2021, the waiver of late renewal fees, and the facilitation of insurance suspensions for vehicles in conjunction with the insurance industry. The NTA has also been in contact representatives from several limousine representative bodies including the particular organisation referred to in the Questions.</p></reply>

Since 2019, holders of UK licences resident in Ireland had been encouraged to exchange their UK licences for an Irish one before 31 December 2020.  </p>  <p>  As the UK is now a third country, Ireland has entered into a licence exchange agreement with the UK to mutually recognise each jurisdiction&rsquo;s licences for the purposes of exchange. This means that a UK licence can still be exchanged for an Irish licence under this new licence exchange agreement. </p>  <p>  The requirement to exchange a licence only applies to people resident in Ireland and does not apply to or affect visitors or holiday makers in Ireland. </p>  <p>  UK licence holders can apply online to exchange their licence, this is the fastest most convenient way to make an application. They must have a verified MyGovID account, which requires a Public Services Card, to apply online. Alternatively, they can apply in person at an National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) Centre by first booking an appointment.  Currently, under level 5 restrictions, only essential workers can exchange their licence at an NDLS Centre. More information is available at www.ndls.ie </p></reply>

The Deputy should be aware that funding under the EU&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Facility is subject to strict timelines around the conclusion of contractual commitments and completion of physical works which will inform project selection.</p><p>In relation to the Western Rail Corridor, the Deputy is aware that two documents have recently been published on my Department&rsquo;s website and are available to view through the following link: </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>The first report is a financial and economic appraisal (sometimes referred to as a preliminary appraisal) of the proposal which was commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, in line with a decision of the previous Government. Following a competitive procurement process, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann selected EY economic consultants to undertake the work and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann submitted a final report to my Department in July 2020. </p><p>Secondly I have also published an independent review of the proposal which was commissioned by my Department. This review was conducted by JASPERS, an agency of the European Union / European Investment Bank, which provides advisory services to Member States (and other public authorities in the EU) and has extensive experience in relation to transport infrastructure proposals in European regions. This independent review noted a number of shortcomings in relation to the proposed re-opening of the Western Rail Corridor Phases 2 and 3 as presented, in particular around issues such as the need to demonstrate the strategic role of the proposal and how it sat within the broader proposed development of the network.</p><p>In light of the analyses conducted thus far, and in particular with regard to the findings of the independent review conducted by JASPERS as commissioned by my Department, I have requested my Department to prepare terms of reference for a Strategic Rail Review. This Review will consider all relevant issues in relation to inter-urban rail, inter/intra-regional rail and rail connectivity to our international gateways, with the latter considering the role of rail freight.  Interestingly this Strategic Review will be conducted on an-island basis in co-operation with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Minister Nichola Mallon, MLA, and officials from both our Departments are now developing terms of reference for the Review. </p><p>I understand this may be the first such Review to be conducted on an all-island basis and this will, I believe, allow for a fuller consideration of the potential role of rail and the network required to support that potential than perhaps has been allowed before.</p><p>I am hopeful that the terms of reference will be agreed and the procurement process launched by the end of Q1. The ultimate duration of the Review will be determined by the work programmes submitted in response to that process; this will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the years ahead.</p></reply>

The Government has always been clear that it would not be possible to fully mitigate against all outcomes following the UK&rsquo;s exit, and the reality of UK being fully outside of the EU means that seamless trade is a thing of the past. This also has implications for the landbridge as customs and regulatory processes are required for moving goods to the EU under transit via GB.</p>  <p>  This is one of the primary reasons why, in advance of the end of the Brexit transition period, my Department in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), undertook a major communications campaign urging business using the GB landbridge to consider a switch to direct routes which would avoid the new control regimes. This campaign was also supported by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Business Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  This communication campaign served to reinforce the message that there is maritime capacity available to transport goods directly to Continental Europe and that these options are many and varied across different modalities providing both accompanied and unaccompanied options to exporters.</p>  <p>  Clearly importers and exporters have reacted to this changed environment and we have witnessed throughout 2020 and at the beginning of 2021 an unprecedented response from the shipping industry in terms of increasing capacity to match market demand on direct shipping routes. It has occurred across all relevant modes and has drawn from all available responses. These responses include (1) utilization of surplus capacity, (2) increasing capacity by altering schedules, (3) redeploying vessels within their fleets, and (4) adding new capacity in the form of additional vessels. </p>  <p>  The increase in choice and frequency in the RoRo freight market over the past year has had a very significant impact on freight capacity to continental EU ports. Weekly RoRo freight capacity to continental EU ports has doubled in the past 12 months. There is now capacity for approximately 5,000 additional HGV&rsquo;s &amp;amp; unaccompanied trailers on continental RoRo services per week in January 2021. </p>  <p>  The largest increase in capacity has come on RoRo services to Northern France. In January 2020, capacity to Northern France represented 35% of all continental EU capacity. As of January 2021, it now accounts for 49%. </p>  <p>  That being said, I am aware of problems still being experienced by trade and backlogs in the supply chain, particularly in GB.  We know that the introduction of new import and export regulatory requirements adds additional burdens on companies. Government Departments and Agencies are continuing to engage with companies and haulage and logistics companies to help them work through these new checks and controls to ensure that they can, if they so choose, continue to use the landbridge.</p>  <p>  Brexit means that we no longer have a seamless trading relationship with our nearest neighbour, and it is going to take a period of time to adjust to this new reality, and by extension for supply chains to adjust and settle. In due time I will give consideration as to whether or not it is necessary to undertake the re-evaluation as suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Masterplan will also provide the required permanent infrastructure to facilitate the post-Brexit border inspection requirements, while also creating increased capacity. The Department of Transport has been advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that planning approval has been granted by Wexford County Council for the development, and that clearance work commenced in December 2020. It is expected that this work will be completed over the course of four phases totaling between three and five years and that the port will be able to continue to operate normally while this is carried out. </p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has also commenced a digitalisation project for the port, which will see investment in all aspects of IT technology with the aim of transforming the Europort into a &lsquo;smart port&rsquo;.

Furthermore, my Department will provide funding to the NTA to enable it to waive its standard annual SPSV (vehicle) licence renewal fees in 2021. </p>  <p>  Unlike vehicle licences, which are renewed annually, SPSV driver licences are normally issued for a five-year period. Therefore the waiving of fees for a single year would not be appropriate, as it would be both unfair to those who have licences which expire in other years and would encourage drivers to renew their licences well before their normal expiry period.

I have therefore referred this part of the question to the Authority for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p><p>My Department is in constant contact with the Road Safety Authority since the start of the pandemic regarding all of its services, the impact of Covid-19 on those services, and how they can best be maintained in the current circumstances. </p><p>Due to suspension of driver testing services in the first 2020 lockdown, along with the health protocols since resumption of service and the further curtailing of services during subsequent level 5 restrictions, a significant backlog has developed. The need to once again return to level 5 restrictions for reasons of public health will inevitably impact further on delays to driver testing. During the level 5 period, driving tests will be available only to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work.  </p><p>While the service is limited during level 5 restrictions, the Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after level 5. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog.</p><p>I am pleased to say, in December, I approved the hiring of a further 40 temporary testers for 22 months. These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers who were re-hired over the course of 2020.</p><p>These measures will help to increase testing capacity.  However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff. It will also take time for the 40 testers to be hired and trained. </p><p>The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased, subject to health assurances.</p><p>The Road Safety Authority has advised it is prioritising driver testing for essential workers and has set up a dedicated webform for same. Anyone looking for an urgent driving test appointment who falls into this category can apply to book a driving test at www.myroadsafety.ie  If there is no available slot and they have made an application, they can ask to be prioritised by accessing <i></i>and providing the relevant details.</p><p>The Department has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time, which is around ten weeks.  It is clear that it will not be possible to arrive at this quickly, given restraints which must be in place due to the pandemic.  It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to reach a normal waiting time.</p></reply>

Passengers are asked to present evidence of their negative/&lsquo;not detected&rsquo; result before boarding their airplane and will be denied boarding if they cannot produce such evidence or do not claim to fall into an exempt category. If a citizen has a genuine humanitarian emergency requiring urgent travel, they should contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate immediately for advice and consular assistance before commencing their journey. </p>  <p>  On 26 January, the Government agreed to introduce a number of measures aimed at reducing the risk that international travel may pose. It was noted that non-essential international travel is in breach of Level 5 rules, and the measures introduced include an increase to the fixed penalty for breach of the rules relating to international travel. The measures also include increased Garda checks and enforcement activity relating to people travelling internationally who are in breach of Level 5 rules. </p>  <p>  The Government also agreed the existing regulations requiring pre-departure PCR tests will also be extended to 5 March. A range of mandatory quarantine measures will be introduced, applying to all international arrivals. Mandatory quarantine at a designated facility will be required for passengers who arrive in breach of the pre-departure negative/'not detected' PCR requirement, and for those who arrive from Brazil and South Africa. In other cases, passengers will be required by law to quarantine at home. Application of these measures to passengers who are not EU/EEA citizens can be introduced by regulations. For all other passengers, it will be necessary to amend primary legislation. The detailed legislative work to implement this will get under way immediately.</p>  <p>   The Government is keeping all measures relating to international travel under review.</p></reply>

State grants, where applicable, are intended to supplement the funding allocated to the maintenance and improvement of roads by local authorities from their own resources.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement schemes. </p>  <p>  Provision was made in the NDP for the  Coonagh to Knockalisheen  Distributor Road (CKDR) subject to necessary approvals.  Even though the CKDR was submitted and approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la as a stand alone scheme,  I am aware that the scheme is sometimes referred to as Phase 1 of the Limerick Northern Distributor Road and that the Deputy's Question may, therefore, relate to the CKDR.  The current position in relation to the CKDR is that I am continuing to consider the recommendation from Limerick County Council  regarding the award of the main construction contract for the scheme.  </p>  <p>  As regards the Limerick Northern Distributor Road itself, under the NDP there is no Exchequer regional and local road grant funding in place to progress the scheme through the planning process to construction stage.</p></reply>

The sites had been due to close at the end of August, 2020 becasue of the  impact of COVID 19 on the number of visitors.  As it transpired, since that commitment was given, new restrictions introduced to control COVID-19 meant that the sites could not open for all of this period, thereby reducing the incremental costs referred to above.  </p>  <p>  In compliance with State aid rules, funding on an exceptional basis was provided to Shannon Heritage at the end of December to cover the incremental costs incurred when the sites were open.  The funding provided is in addition to the economy-wide supports Government has put in place including the TWSS, EWSS, the recently extended rates waiver and CRSS, all of which have been availed of by Shannon Heritage.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 reflected Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to safeguarding Ireland&rsquo;s strategic heritage sites and a &euro;55m Recovery and Resilience Scheme for strategically important tourism enterprises was announced. Shannon Heritage is exploring the potential for funding under this Scheme. I also understand that Shannon Group has applied for funding from F&aacute;ilte Ireland under its large capital grants scheme for the redevelopment of the Bunratty Folk Park.  </p>  <p>  The position in relation to the opening of Shannon Heritage sites in 2021 is a matter for Shannon Group.  In this regard, Shannon Group has advised my Department that given the impacts of COVID-19 (lack of international traffic, low level of domestic visitors) and the resultant significant losses, it is not viable to keep the heritage sites open this year in line with its pre-COVID-19 operating model.  Government was recently informed that, in order to mitigate the losses incurred, Shannon Heritage has made a decision to operate on a seasonal basis.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the future of the Shannon Heritage business, options to secure the future of Shannon Heritage are currently being considered but no decision has yet been taken in this regard.</p></reply>

This is fundamentally impacting on many businesses in Ireland, including on the road haulage sector. </p>  <p>  These changes represent a considerable shock to existing supply chains and logistics arrangements. The checks and controls which are now taking place are necessary and permanent, and are required in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations to the Single Market and to protect public health and food. The Government fully acknowledges that this presents significant challenges and imposes additional burdens on hauliers and on all businesses trading with Great Britain. This is evidenced by the lower than anticipated flows of goods from Great Britain to Ireland since 1 January 2021.   </p>  <p>  The Government has provided a range of supports to assist businesses in adapting to the new rules and procedures that are now in place, including support from Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Ready for Customs Grant scheme and Skillnet Ireland&rsquo;s Clear Customs Training programme.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that the relevant agencies continue to work around the clock to ensure trade can flow to the greatest extent possible. Where difficulties have arisen for users in specific cases, the agencies are engaging directly &ndash; whether with the companies, representative organisations or individual drivers &ndash; to get the issues resolved. </p>  <p>   I am also aware that the agencies have engaged extensively with the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) and other logistics representative bodies and continue to do so. A stakeholders' forum for the Haulage and Logistics Sector, including the IRHA and FTAI, hosted by my Department, meets weekly and comprises representatives from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture and the Marine, and the HSE.  In addition, the Departments and agencies engage with the IRHA and other representative bodies continuously on an ad hoc basis as issues arise. I also understand that the Revenue Commissioners held a technical workshop with the IRHA on Friday 15 January on the new Revenue systems.  </p>  <p>  My Department remains in regular contact with the haulage and logistics sector and also participates in Brexit retail and enterprise forums hosted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to monitor issues and developments in those sectors.  </p></reply>

The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles (EVs), who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs. To date no chargers have been installed by local authorities under the scheme. The SEAI has, however, received requests from twelve local authorities for applications under the scheme and two completed applications from Louth County Council and Dublin City Council to install a total of 24 charge points within their administrative areas. These applications are currently being assessed for approval. The relevant information for the twelve local authorities who requested an application is provided in tabular form below. </p><p>My Department is working closely with key stakeholders, including local government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes helping to develop appropriate guidance for local authorities to facilitate the expansion of the national public charging network using the supports available under the Public Charge Point Scheme. I would also note that the four Dublin local authorities are currently examining a combined approach to developing a network of charging infrastructure across the metropolitan area.</p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and to support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit. </p><p>  ">Table1</p></reply>

That Act sets out the regulatory framework for the entire small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector, including taxis, hackneys and other similar activities. The Act requires that such services can only be provided where there is an SPSV licence for the vehicle and also an SPSV licence for the driver.  The focus of the regulatory regime is to protect the interests of consumers of these services in terms of both the safety and quality of the service provided.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsiblity for regulation of the sector.  I understand that the specific company referred to by the Deputy is licenced by the NTA as a taxi dispatch operator. </p>  <p>  The NTA has undertaken a nationwide study to inform its approach to rolling out improved public transport across the country (excluding the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), Regional Cities and Large Towns) by providing better connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide. Arising from this study, I am advised that the NTA is undertaking a two-phase consultation on its proposals, titled 'Connecting Ireland', with stakeholder engagement first involving officials from Local and Regional Authorities which commenced in Q4 2020 and going through to Q1 2021, and with wider public consultation commencing in Q2 2021. </p>  <p>  Our Programme for Government commitments in relation to public transport in rural areas will be progressed with a priority on a Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system, as well as expanding the Local Link rural transport service and prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity.    </p>  <p>  Due to the impact of COVID-19, however, the current public health advice advises people limit travel, avoid public transport, and work from home unless they are essential workers and their presence is required in the workplace. In that context, it would simply not be appropriate to pursue a ride-hailing pilot at this time. However, once the present pandemic abates, the NTA will be asked to develop a pilot to examine the potential for ride-hailing services to improve rural connectivity. </p></reply>

The Rules of the Road also include a strong recommendation supporting the wearing of light, and preferably high-visibility, clothing.</p><p>These campaigns and their effectiveness are under constant review.</p></reply>

A decision on this issue is expected by early February.</p>  <p>  To renew your driving licence you are required to present photographic ID, evidence of PPSN, evidence of address and evidence of residency entitlement. An applicant must present in person at a National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) office where the required documentation can be examined and a face to face verification can be made. </p>  <p>  When applying online, the same information is required and  the challenge of verifying a person&rsquo;s identity is more difficult than when someone presents in person at an NDLS office. A verified MyGovID account, which requires a Public Service Card (PSC), satisfies this requirement.</p>  <p>  The PSC is a way to streamline the identification process across all public services, making application for all services easier for everyone, and taking away unnecessary burdens from the citizen and the State. The intention is that people will need to go through the cumbersome process of providing documents to prove their identity only once - for the PSC - and then be able to use that card as an ID for a wide range of public services.  More particularly, if people are to have confidence in using public services online, they need to have an verified and authenticated online identity and MyGovID, building on the Public Services Card, gives people that confidence and the means to access services online.</p>  <p>  When it is possible to lower restrictions and increase access to the NDLS centres, measures put in place to align with the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocols will be maintained. Each centre has been assessed and appropriate signage, sanitation and handwashing, and social distancing measures such as reduced seating in waiting areas and customer touchpoint cleansing have been introduced.  Customers will be accompanied into and out of centres and required to adhere to necessary health and safety guidelines. The measures that have been put in place are for the health and safety of all of our customer and our staff. </p></reply>

Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and public transport has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the Covid crisis.  I would like to thank both all operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services safely during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network.   </p>  <p>  The Government's "Living with Covid" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the Plan.   With the current Level 5 restrictions, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's Level 5 guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has significantly reduced the demand for public transport.  There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so. For the duration of current Level 5 restrictions, public transport services are for essential workers and essential journeys only. People are also being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical. The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most and in particular frontline workers.</p>  <p>  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice. While no significant capacity issues have been reported by operators since the move to level 5, the NTA and operators are continuing to monitor passenger loadings, and where necessary additional services will be provided on certain routes at certain times of the day subject to driver availability.</p></reply>

This campaign was also supported by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Business Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p><p>This communication campaign served to reinforce the message that there is maritime capacity available to transport goods directly to Continental Europe and that these options are many and varied across different modalities providing both accompanied and unaccompanied options to exporters. </p><p>We have witnessed throughout 2020 and at the beginning of 2021 an unprecedented response from the shipping industry in terms of increasing capacity to match market demand. It has occurred across all relevant modes and has drawn from all available responses. These responses include (1) utilization of surplus capacity, (2) increasing capacity by altering schedules, (3) redeploying vessels within their fleets, and (4) adding new capacity in the form of additional vessels. </p><p>In terms of transport related logistical snags from the island of Ireland directly to the EU some difficulties were reported over the weekend of January 9th, this related to some overbooking which occurred on one operator&rsquo;s system. With the commencement of new shipping services and a shift in logistics patterns, some initial problems were to be expected, the backlog of freight that arose that weekend was cleared relatively quickly.</p><p><b>Number of Sailings</b></p><p>As of January 2021, there are around 60 RoRo freight sailings between Ireland and the Continent in a typical week. This includes five shipping operators, Irish Ferries, Stena Line, DFDS, Brittany Ferries and CLDN offering both accompanied and unaccompanied freight. This represents an increase of around 34 sailings per week, or around 130% increase in continental RoRo frequency compared to January 2020. </p><p>Specifically in relation to sailings between Ireland and France, in January 2020, there were 12 weekly sailings to and from Northern France. These were provided by Irish Ferries and Stena Line to the port of Cherbourg (not including the seasonal service operated by Brittany Ferries to Roscoff). In the last 12 months, the number of sailings to Northern France has increased by 24. Based on published schedules, there are now some 36 sailings per week to and from Northern French ports provided by Stena Line, Irish Ferries, DFDS and Brittany Ferries. </p><p><b>Freight Capacity</b></p><p>The increase in choice and frequency in the RoRo freight market over the past year has had a very significant impact on freight capacity to continental EU ports. Weekly RoRo freight capacity to continental EU ports has doubled in the past 12 months. There is now capacity for approximately 5,000 additional HGV&rsquo;s &amp;amp; unaccompanied trailers on continental RoRo services per week in January 2021. </p><p>The largest increase in capacity has come on RoRo services to Northern France. In January 2020, capacity to Northern France represented 35% of all continental EU capacity. As of January 2021, it now accounts for 49%. </p><p>Unaccompanied RoRo freight is an essential component of continental RoRo capacity. In 2020, unaccompanied RoRo freight made up over 80%<b></b>of all continental RoRo volume.  </p><p><b>Details of growth in direct services</b></p><p>Details on additional capacity added on direct services since 1 January 2021 include the following:-</p><p>- On 10 December 2020, Stena Line announced an additional ship on the Rosslare to Cherbourg route, doubling their capacity and frequency of sailings from January 4th.</p><p>- Irish Ferries and Stena changed their schedules to minimise overlapping so that a daily RoRo services from Ireland to Cherbourg was provided from January 2021. </p><p>- DFDS launched a new service from Rosslare to Dunkerque from 2 January 2021. There are six weekly departures from each port with a crossing time of 24 hours and capacity for up to 125 HGVs. </p><p>- CldN have added a second weekly call from Cork to Zeebrugge to cope with the increasing demand on this route which commenced on January 8<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>- Irish Ferries swopped their larger ship, the WB Yeats, from the Dublin /Holyhead to the Dublin-Cherbourg route from January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2021, substantially increasing capacity on this route. Also, the Epsilon will operate on a temporary basis with one rotation on weekends where there is increased demand on the Dublin-Cherbourg route.</p><p>- On January 13<sup>th</sup>Stena Line temporarily swapped the Stena Horizon with their new and larger ship the Stena Embla on the Rosslare/Cherbourg route, the Horizon has since been reinstated.</p><p>- On January 16<sup>th</sup>Stena also announced they were commencing a new Saturday service from Dublin to Cherbourg commencing on 25<sup>th</sup>January. This will be kept under review based on demand.</p><p>- Brittany Ferries brought forward their once weekly sailing from Rosslare to Cherbourg from March 2021 to January 18<sup>th</sup>, 2021.</p><p>- New LOLO service operated by Samskip will commence on the Dublin-Amsterdam route from January 25<sup>th</sup>, 2021.</p><p>These new sailings are in addition to a number of other new services and increased sailings that came on stream over last Summer, including new RoRo services from Ireland to Zeebrugge, Santander and Portugal by CLDN.</p></reply>

It is a priority piece of reforming legislation, which I hope will move through the legislative process at pace, beginning next month. </p>  <p>  As provided for in the published Bill, the proposed institutional reforms will create a single national aviation regulator responsible for safety, security and economic regulation (including consumer affairs) by combining the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) and the Commission for Aviation Regulation. It will also separate out the for-profit air traffic control services functions of the IAA and place them in a newly formed commercial semi-state company, the Irish Air Navigation Service.  Importantly, in the context of the structural changes required, it guarantees the terms and conditions of all current staff.</p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to modernise and strengthen the regulation and oversight of the Irish aviation industry in order to secure - for the long term - Ireland's position as global leader in aviation (which demands best practice regulatory structures and enforcement) and to advance and protect consumer interests.   I believe this Bill lends itself to broad, cross-party support.  I welcome the scrutiny and contribution of Oireachtas members to come, and ultimately I am hopeful for its safe passage through the Houses in the coming months.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p>  <p>  While many borrowers whose payment break has ended have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19 and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may now be in difficulty for the first time. </p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated this month that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation. It is in the best long term interests of both the borrower and lender that engagement takes place in relation to a particular loan difficulty and that the most appropriate solution to the individual case is adopted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of Covid-19.  The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Central Credit Register (CCR), it is important to note that the CCR does not produce credit gradings, rather its purpose is to provide factual information to lenders and borrowers on a borrower&rsquo;s credit record. The Central Bank has also advised lenders that in their reporting to the CCR, they will need to apply judgement around whether a restructure has been agreed in response to an identification of financial distress and should be reported as such.</p>  <p>  Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. The HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for affordable new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.</p><p>HTB is designed to stimulate the supply of new houses in the housing market and to assist first time buyers in accumulating a deposit for a new home. In order to help further meet these goals, I announced an enhancement to the existing scheme with effect from 23 July last for the remainder of 2020 as part of the July Stimulus Package.  The legislation that gives effect to this is set out in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020. The Finance Act 2020 further extended the period of application of the enhanced levels of support until 31 December 2021.  The Help-to-Buy scheme itself is also scheduled to expire at that point. </p><p>In relation to Deputy Canney's question, The current Central Bank macro-prudential mortgage rules restrict the amount of money a purchaser can borrow to a maximum of 3.5 times of their gross income (i.e. the 'loan to income' rule). The Central Bank is independent in the exercise of its functions. This is not related to the 70% LTV condition of the HTB scheme. HTB provides that a purchaser who does not borrow 70% or more of the value of the home cannot avail of the scheme. Individuals who are in the fortunate position of being able to avail of a mortgage at a lower loan-to-value ratio than 70% are considered to have sufficient resources to more than meet the deposit requirements of the macro-prudential rules and thus less in need of assistance from the Exchequer. Lowering the ceiling, as suggested by the Deputy, could only increase deadweight in the scheme.  Further, with regard to the suggestion that single applicants should be treated differently to joint applicants, it is fair and equitable that the scheme treats everyone equally.</p><p>In relation to the questions from Deputy Bruton and Deputy Haughey, I am advised by Revenue that Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.  A key condition outlined in Section 477C(17) TCA requires that a qualifying residence must be occupied for a minimum period of 5 years<b></b>by the first-time buyer as his or her only or main residence, otherwise the HTB payment, or a proportion thereof, will be required to be repaid to Revenue.  The HTB claimant(s) is required to notify revenue if occupation of the qualifying residence ceases within the 5-year period and to repay the relevant amount within 3 months. The rate of clawback due will depend on the year in which the residence ceases to be occupied. The Tax and Duty manual, <i>Part 15-01-46</i>Help to Buy Scheme, under Section 18 provides details regarding the clawback provisions and example scenarios. Where the applicant(s) cease to occupy a property which they have received a HTB payment on within 5 years, due to the family&rsquo;s need for larger accommodation, they would be required to repay a portion of the HTB payment to Revenue. The payment due would be calculated in proportion to the amount of time they have occupied the property as set out in Section 477C (17)(b)(ii) TCA.  I am not considering making any changes to these provisions. </p><p>In relation to Deputy Burke's question, as indicated above, HTB is due to expire at the end of the current year.  With a measure such as this, it would be normal practice to carry out a review to assist decision making in advance of the scheduled expiry.I do not intend to prejudge the outcome the likely review at this early stage in the year.</p></reply>

The scheme was developed at a time when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates, and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. </p><p>In order to avail of the tax credit, taxpayers are required to upload a copy of their receipt(s) for qualifying expenditure to the Revenue Receipts Tracker and then make a formal claim for the credit when submitting their annual Income Tax Return. </p><p>Under the scheme, a claim may be made in relation to qualifying expenditure incurred between the period 1 October 2020 and 30 April 2021. Broadly, qualifying expenditure includes expenditure on either holiday accommodation or &ldquo;eat in&rdquo; food and drink, with a minimum expenditure amount of &euro;25 per transaction being required.  As at 21 January, 3,125 service providers have registered to participate in the scheme.</p><p>Since 1 October 2020 when the Stay and Spend scheme commenced, a total of 43,980 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 20 January 2021. The expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;6,971,859 and the potential tax cost is &euro;1,394,372, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. </p><p>Claims relating to qualifying expenditure incurred in the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 December 2020 can be made when an individual is submitting his/her 2020 Income Tax Return, which is now available for submission. As at 18 January 2021 a total of 4,441 taxpayers Income Tax Returns for 2020 have included the Stay and Spend credit. These claims relate to &euro;1,527,149 of the qualifying expenditure recorded on the Revenue Receipts Tracker to date and the tax cost of same amounts to &euro;305,430. However, as the filing deadline for the 2020 Income Tax Return is not until 31 October 2021, information on the total number of claims and cost for the 2020 year of assessment will not be available until after the filing date and the returns have been processed.  Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the administration of the Stay and Spend scheme is carried out as part of Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing work, using existing resources. In addition, no costs have been incurred by Revenue or by my Department in respect of the marketing and advertisement of the scheme. As regards the question asked by Deputy Murphy, the amount spent to date on marketing and advertising the scheme as it relates to F&aacute;ilte Ireland is a matter for the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s Information Technology Division was required to develop a number of technical components to support the new Stay and Spend scheme. This included the development of a new Stay and Spend interface within the Revenue Receipts Tracker App. Revenue was already in the process of redeveloping and upgrading the technology of its mobile app during the second quarter of 2020, and the addition of Stay and Spend functionality into the Revenue Receipts Tracker App was a small extension to the work that was already underway. The total cost of the redevelopment and technology upgrade of Revenue&rsquo;s mobile app was &euro;98,000, a small portion of which is attributable to the Stay and Spend scheme.  In addition, Revenue&rsquo;s Information Technology Division developed a new registration process for service providers and an extension to the existing Income Tax Return to pre-populate it with the receipts uploaded through the Revenue Receipts Tracker App, and to allow individuals to claim the Stay and Spend tax credit through their annual return. The total cost of these developments was &euro;140,000.</p><p>As mentioned already, the Stay and Spend scheme was devised at a time when there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, thus far, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.</p><p>Stay and Spend is due to operate until 30 April but the flexibility exists for me to extend its operation in 2021 beyond that date (to end 2021).  It is too early as yet to take definitive decisions in that regard.  Much will depend on how circumstances unfold in the months ahead.  As I have said before, I will keep an eye on how matters develop and the role that the scheme might play and consider if any changes need to be made. </p><p>Finally, it is important also to recall that Stay and Spend shouldn't be viewed in isolation from the other measures put in place to support businesses generally and the hospitality sector in particular. The VAT change; the rates waiver; the wage support scheme and its application to new or seasonal staff; and other Government measures all play a part in helping the hospitality sector cope with the challenges it faces.</p></reply>

The PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare type payments, such as Jobseekers Benefit and Jobseekers Benefit (Self-Employed), and is exempt from USC and PRSI charges. </p>  <p>  I do not propose to introduce a tax amnesty for PUP recipients as suggested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  It would be inequitable if PUP recipients were granted relief while those on Jobseekers Benefit were not. It would be similarly unfair to those in receipt of the temporary wage subsidy payment, as well as those who continued in employment who must pay tax on their emoluments.</p>  <p>  In the case of lower income taxpayers or those whose income comprises solely of social welfare payments, a significant liability to tax typically does not arise because the value of social welfare payments received in a tax year are usually lower than the income sheltered by the main income tax credits.  Further, in cases where the tax liability for those payments exceeds unused personal and PAYE tax credits for 2020, the level of income tax due may be reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset.</p>  <p>  The steps taken by Revenue, whereby individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax liability or have Revenue collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over four years, interest free, is a demonstration of how arrangements have been made to minimise financial hardship to the greatest extent possible on taxpayers challenged by COVID-19.    </p>  <p>  Although the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on their personal circumstances, I note that almost half of those in receipt of the PUP or TWSS in 2020 have no outstanding liability to discharge (in fact over a third are due a refund). In the case of the remaining taxpayer units with an outstanding liability, the data indicates that amounts to be collected are modest in scale, with 44% owing less than &euro;500 and 72% having a liability of less than &euro;1,000. If paid over the four year period beginning in 2022, the majority of those cases will owe less than &euro;5 per week, with nearly half paying less than &euro;2.50 per week.  These figures represent a preliminary liability and may be further reduced by additional tax credits or reliefs such as health expenses.  </p>  <p>  I am of the view that Revenue has been adopting a fair and flexible approach to collecting tax due on payments made under the PUP. </p></reply>

If the Deputy wishes to provide me with the specific details, I will pass these on to Revenue and Revenue will be happy to engage directly with the Deputy on the matter.</p>  <p>I am advised by Revenue that its overarching objective in the context of the trading arrangements with Great Britain, following completion of the UKs departure from the EU, is to facilitate the movement of legitimate trade. Since January 1, following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, the UK has been outside the EU Single Market and Customs Union and is now a 3rd country which means that a range of customs formalities apply to goods moving to, from or through the United Kingdom, excluding Northern Ireland. In that context, I am assured by Revenue that it appreciates the challenges that the freight industry is facing due to the new trading arrangements, with the customs formalities and other regulatory requirements that now apply to such trade.  Customs requirements can be complex for businesses, but it is essential that Ireland fulfils its obligations as a member of the EU and that we protect public health, food safety and product standards as well as the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union. Customs and SPS formalities are now an integral part of trade with Great Britain.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that some businesses have encountered challenges in meeting their customs obligations, but it is also important to recognise that a significant number of businesses have successfully made the transition to the new trading environment and that the majority of goods going through the ports are being green routed on arrival meaning they can leave the port without the need for intervention by Customs or other State agencies.  </p>  <p>  Where businesses are experiencing delays, I am informed by Revenue that in the majority of cases, this has been caused by customs documentation not being provided or having been completed incorrectly and as a result the goods cannot be released from the port for free circulation. </p>  <p>  While Revenue is not in a position to comment on the specific case, I am advised that in most instances of delay it is a feature of incomplete or incorrect information which prevents the desired clearance of the goods. </p>  <p>  Revenue has provided a 24/7 helpline service that can be contacted when a particular issue arises, 01-7383685. Revenue is continuing its intensive engagement with trade and business, on both a collective and individual basis, including meetings with haulage representative bodies. Revenue will continue to consider the issues raised with them in order to find practical solutions, where that is possible, to resolve problems being encountered. </p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. On 30 November last, the BPFI reported that approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% returned on reduced repayments.</p><p>The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated in recent days that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations </p><p> </p><p>set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.</p><p>In addition, Credit Review  was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers.</p><p>It should be noted that the Central Credit Register does not produce credit scores; rather the information on a credit report provided by the Central Credit Register is factual in nature and the information is provided to the Central Credit Register by lenders.  It contains no guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit or repayment arrangements agreed with borrowers.Subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements, it is a matter for lenders to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites.</p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support. </p></reply>

The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2021 compared with the same period in 2019.  </p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the EWSS legislation contains a number of important safeguards and flexibilities in so far as the scheme&rsquo;s operation and effectiveness is concerned.  As Minister for Finance, I am required under the law to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and to have economic assessments made every 2 months at least.   </p>  <p>  It is also noted that the EWSS legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the EWSS legislation contains sufficient safeguards to ensure that the scheme is not taken advantage of by employers, while at the same time allowing viable firms to access the support they need. </p></reply>

In addition, we cannot compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or groups, such as young or recently qualified drivers who may use a van or commercial car for employment.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that firms will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer motor cover and what terms to apply.  For example, factors may include the driver&rsquo;s age; relevant driving experience; the age and type of vehicle; how and where the vehicle is used; the claims record; the number of drivers; and the storage location. Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market, demonstrating why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies.   </p>  <p>  Where an individual is having difficulty in receiving an insurance quotation, or a private company has issues in relation to named drivers on their fleet policy, which may be relevant in this case, they may wish to use the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA). Under the terms of the DCA, which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse cover if the person has approached at least three insurers and has been unable to obtain cover from them. In this regard, there are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website, while more generally, Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. The relevant contact details are: feedback@insuranceireland.eu or declined@insuranceireland.eu.</p>  <p>  Finally, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government. It is my intention, along with Minister of State Fleming, to work to ensure that the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government are progressed in accordance with the Action Plan for Insurance Reform.  In this regard, we will work with our Government colleagues to ensure that a Whole-of-Government approach continues to be the focus and that the cumulative impact of all of the actions Plan can have a positive effect on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-27a.546.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700067#WRK04200"><p>I am aware that the general level of lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries, though it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland.  For example, the interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.67% in November 2020. </p>  <p>However, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p> credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p> the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);</p>  <p> higher cost-to-income: growing cost inefficiencies have been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years;</p>  <p> there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). </p>  <p>The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. </p>  <p>Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with their lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.  </p></reply>

The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) on 1 September 2020. </p><p>To ensure payments were made to employees as quickly as possible, Revenue operated a &lsquo;transitional phase&rsquo; of the TWSS from late March until 3 May 2020. The &lsquo;transitional phase&rsquo; provided a subsidy of 70% of the average net weekly pay up to maximum of &euro;410 in respect of eligible employees. </p><p>On 4 May 2020 the TWSS moved to the &lsquo;operational phase&rsquo; and included increased subsidy rates of up to 85%, subject to various maximum payments.  During this phase, the subsidy amount paid to employers was based on each employee&rsquo;s <i>Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay (ARNWP</i>), which was calculated using average net earnings in January/February 2020.</p><p>According to Revenue&rsquo;s records, the person in question had three active employments in 2020, with one employer participating in the TWSS. This employer started operating the scheme in April 2020 and the person first received a subsidy of &euro;260.04 on 30 April 2020.  Subsequent monthly payments from May to August 2020 were reported (to Revenue) by the employer in respect of the person, indicating subsidy payments of &euro;315.77. The amount of subsidy paid to the person corresponds with his <i>ARNWP</i>and the applicable rates of subsidy due to him under the scheme.</p><p>Revenue has confirmed that it is engaging directly with the employer regarding the actual amount of TWSS that was paid to the person. Once the amounts are confirmed, Revenue will ensure any necessary adjustments are made by the employer to the person&rsquo;s 2020 salary record, which will impact (reduce) his taxable income for the year.</p><p>The TWSS payments correctly received by the person are subject to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC). The amount due can be reduced by the allocation of any unused tax credits for 2020 or additional tax credits such as health expenses. Any remaining balance at that point will be collected, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing tax credits, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

To date, over &euro;3m of subsidy payments has been recouped in aggregate from some 620 employers, and enquiries are ongoing in the remaining cases. </p>  <p>  It is to be noted that these figures are in the context of total TWSS payments in excess of &euro;2.8bn to some 66,000 employers. It should also be noted that 5,195 employers have repaid over &euro;79m in TWSS payments up to 31 December 2020. The overpayments typically occurred in circumstances where the level of estimated business decline did not materialise or where unintended errors were included in claims.    </p>  <p>  Any TWSS payments received by employees are subject to income tax and USC irrespective of whether the employer was correctly eligible to participate in the scheme or not. Where Revenue has recovered TWSS amounts from ineligible employers, it is a matter between the parties (i.e. employer and employee) as to whether the payments are subsequently recouped from relevant employees. Any such recoupment by employers will result in a reduction in the taxable income of the relevant employees.</p>  <p>  Where the TWSS amounts paid to relevant employees are not recouped by the employer, then the income tax and USC liabilities remain due. Revenue has confirmed that these liabilities, which may be reduced by the allocation of unused tax credits or additional tax credits such as health expenses, will be collected, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022. This will be achieved by reducing tax credits for those years, thereby reducing any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

However, the reality of COVID-19 is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly. </p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible.  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times.  To date, subsidy payments of over &euro;1.5 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;270m granted to over 41,600 employers in respect of over 467,000 employees. </p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.  It is noted that the legislation implementing the measure provides that it will be in place until 31 March 2021, but also provides that the scheme may be extended until the end of June 2021 if required and subject to certain procedural conditions. </p>  <p>  It is likely that continued support will be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible.  Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p>  <p>  In the meantime I am satisfied that the design of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) fully takes account of the changing environment around living with the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19. </p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support at this time, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p>  <p>  Regarding the offering of further mortgage payment breaks, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated in recent days that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of COVID-19.

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p><p>Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at:  </p><p>.</p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. </p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or restrict access to its business premises. Where a business supplies goods or services to businesses in the hospitality industry which, under the specific terms of the Covid restrictions, are required to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises (for example pubs and restaurants), it will not result in the supplier business being eligible to make a claim under CRSS.  Each business must meet the qualification criteria in their own right.</p><p>Businesses whose trading profits are not chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D do not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS. </p><p>A childcare provider that is not chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D will not qualify for CRSS.  This includes a childcare provider that has been granted charitable tax exemption status because it is exempt from paying corporation tax or income tax on any income received where the income is used for its main charitable purpose. </p><p>A sports club that has been granted a sports body exemption is exempt from paying Corporation Tax or Income tax on any income received where the income is used for the purposes of promoting the game or sport. Such income would include income from a bar. A sports club with such an exemption is not chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D in respect of its income and therefore does not qualify for CRSS. I am advised by Revenue that a list of sports bodies that have been granted an exemption is published on their website and Ballybrown GAA Club<i></i>is on the list. On that basis, it does not qualify for CRSS. </p><p>An approved sports body is not exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) or payroll taxes and may be entitled to financial support under other measures put in place by the Government, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).  These clubs may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities and any excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).</p><p>The CRSS is just one of the Government&rsquo;s supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may be entitled to alternative supports put in place by the Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020. I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS.</p><p>The purpose of the CRSS is to provide additional support to the businesses who have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health Regulations.  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

The incentive was introduced in 2001 in the five city boroughs of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. It provided relief of 100 per cent for eligible expenditure on the refurbishment or conversion of under-utilised space for residential accommodation at a rate of 10 per cent per annum over 10 years, against total income. The incentive closed to new claimants in mid-2006.</p><p>The estimated total cost to the Exchequer of the scheme was some &euro;48.7m and an estimated 440 residential units were delivered.</p><p>A review of various existing tax incentives was undertaken by my Department, in part internally and in part by Indecon and Goodbody Economic Consultants, and included an examination of the LOTS incentive. The review was published in three volumes in February 2006. Volume two, the Goodbody Review of Area Based Tax Incentive Renewal Schemes is available at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>On the question about the success of the scheme, the above review found that there was a relatively limited take-up of the scheme for a variety of reasons.

The Update demonstrates that Ireland has a proven track record of taking significant actions to prevent aggressive tax planning. Appendix 1 of the Update outlines 20 corporation tax reforms that Ireland has implemented since 2013, showing an extensive and continuing programme of reform.  The Deputy may also be interested in page 21 of the Update, which summarises our commitments to future action, consideration and consultation to ensure that our corporation tax code remains competitive, fair and sustainable.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's second question, the Department of Finance carried out a comprehensive economic impact assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax policy in 2014. This identified that Ireland collects a similar share of corporation tax as a percentage of GDP to the EU average. Also, a distinctive feature of the Irish economy is the high share of economic activity accounted for by foreign direct investment. Multinationals also account for a large proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax receipts, which is not surprising given our success in attracting leading multinationals to locate here and our high level of integration with the global economy. This level of concentration results in potential volatility in our corporation tax receipts, a fact that has been widely recognised by commentators including the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. </p>  <p>  My officials and I are fully aware of the risks associated with this level of concentration and volatility, and actions have been taken in recent years to mitigate the risk of over-reliance on potentially cyclical or over-concentrated corporation tax receipts. A range of base broadening measures have been introduced over the last decade and the rainy day fund was established and funded.  While corporation tax receipts were maintained and in fact over-performed against expectation in 2020, these recent measures helped to fund the emergency support and stimulus measures introduced by the Government last year to support businesses facing the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current strength in corporation tax receipts, the risk of future volatility remains.  The second round of the OECD BEPS process could pose a risk to corporation tax revenues in small open economies such as Ireland. Specifically, the allocation of corporation tax receipts based on the location of a company&rsquo;s sales or users would benefit larger markets that are net-importers. Small, export-intensive economies such as Ireland would lose a portion of its tax base as a larger proportion of profits would be allocated to larger countries. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, any impact on the Irish Exchequer and on inward investment will depend on the detail of whatever is actually agreed globally. However, my Department&rsquo;s working estimate based on ongoing work being carried out by the Revenue Commissioners, is that the overall risk from BEPS-related changes could be in the range of &euro;800 million to &euro;2 billion annually. These significant potential costs notwithstanding, Ireland recognises that change is necessary to ensure that we have an international tax framework which fits the modern world. The certainty and stability provided by a globally agreed sustainable solution would help encourage trade and economic growth to the benefit of all.</p></reply>

The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors to direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. REITs are required to distribute 85% of all property income profits annually to investors. Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at a rate of 25% must be applied to these distributions, other than those distributed to certain limited classes of investors such as pensions and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.</p>  <p>  An Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. The legislation was introduced to address concerns raised regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-residents to invest in Irish property. Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place. Irish resident investors may be subject to the investment undertakings exit tax, at a rate of 41%.</p>  <p>  In 2019, officials in my Department produced a report on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) as respects their investment in the Irish property market.  The report was presented to the Tax Strategy Group and published in July 2019. It provided a basis for policy discussions and the amendments which were introduced in Finance Act 2019. </p>  <p>  In relation to REITs, Finance Act 2019 extended the obligation to deduct DWT to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. If the net proceeds from such capital disposals are not re-invested in the REIT business or distributed within a 2 year period, they become part of the profits of the REIT business, 85% of which must be distributed annually. In addition, the deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status were restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. Finance Act 2019 also introduced a &ldquo;wholly and exclusively&rdquo; test when calculating the REIT profits available for distribution. This test was introduced to ensure that inflated costs, such as inflated management fees, cannot be used to reduce distributable profits. These amendments ensure the regime operates as intended.</p>  <p>  In relation to IREFs, amendments were made to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units. In addition, the IREF return filing requirement was placed on a mandatory annual footing and the information which Revenue can request was increased to facilitate ongoing monitoring of the sector. These amendments were made to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department and Revenue continue to monitor the taxation of IREFs and REITS. Revenue have advised me that they analyse returns submitted by both IREFs and REITs and have measures available to them in the event of non-compliance. Should additional issues be identified I will take further action as necessary. </p></reply>

The ATAD Anti-Hybrid rules have applied to all corporate taxpayers with effect from 1 January 2020. They are intended to prevent arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an instrument or entity under the tax laws of two or more jurisdictions to generate a tax advantage. </p>  <p>  As the Anti-Hybrid rules took effect from 1 January 2020, it is only when corporation tax returns for 2020 are filed and analysed that the effect of these rules on Irish corporation tax receipts will be known. However, the expectation is they may not significantly affect Irish companies because our worldwide system of taxation and various existing Anti-Hybrid and anti-avoidance rules already existing in legislation have meant that hybrid structures have not been a feature of tax planning here. </p>  <p>  It is also to be noted that Anti-Hybrid rules are not designed primarily to raise Exchequer revenue, but rather to modify taxpayer behaviour by preventing the use of hybrid mismatches to create tax advantages. The purpose of the rules is to improve the robustness of the international corporate tax system as a whole, and the coordinated introduction of Anti-Hybrid rules across all EU Member States aims to ensure their effective operation. Implementing Anti-Hybrid rules is part of a global solution to a global problem.</p></reply>

In relation to vehicles from Northern Ireland </p><p>- Vehicles registered in Northern Ireland or to a person resident in Northern Ireland <i>before</i>1 January 2021 can be registered in Ireland without any checks on the customs status.</p><p>- Vehicles <i>first</i>registered in Northern Ireland <i>after</i>1 January 2021 can be registered in Ireland without any checks on the customs status.</p><p>Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is payable on such vehicles upon registration in the State. Value Added Tax (VAT) is payable on new vehicles only. New vehicles as defined for VAT purposes are generally vehicles under six months old or with less than 6,000km. </p><p>Under the VAT rules currently in force in the UK, vehicles <i>first </i>registered in Great Britain and imported into Northern Ireland after 31 December are liable to customs duty, if applicable, and VAT at import if they are subsequently imported into the State. </p><p>The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain where the relevant rules of origin are met. It is important to note that a claim for preferential tariff treatment for imports into Ireland can be made only where the goods are of UK origin. The customs tariff duty on the import of passenger cars of UK origin is 0%. The customs tariff duty on the import of passenger cars of non-UK origin is 10%. Customs tariff duty, if applicable, applies on the customs value of the vehicle. To import a car of EU origin from Great Britain into Ireland, a customs declaration must be completed. The customs value is the invoice price plus the cost of transport and insurance. In addition to any import tariff, VAT at 21% will also apply.  </p><p>The routing of importations of used vehicles from Great Britain into the State through Northern Ireland to avoid EU requirements in relation to customs duty and VAT at import will not be permitted.  </p></reply>

Passenger Vehicles (EU Category M) and Commercial Vehicles (EU Category N) are classified based on the specifications of these vehicle types and in particular, the number of seats and their goods carrying capacity.  There are no provisions for the classification of vehicles based on their usage.</p><p>A vehicle may be registered as an ambulance if it conforms to the definition provided in Regulation (EU) 2018/858. This states that the vehicle must be: &ldquo;<i>intended for the transport of sick or injured people and having special equipment for such purpose</i>.&rdquo;  Furthermore, the layout and technical equipment of the patient compartment have to comply with the European requirement (IS EN 1789:2007 +A1: 2010 +A2:2014) on medical vehicles and their equipment. This standard emphasises, amongst other things, the ceiling clearance level of the patient compartment which gives sufficient space for the treatment of the casualty during transport. Under the terms of the Directive these vehicles are assigned an EU SC bodywork code as a special purpose vehicle at EU type-approval stage.  </p><p>Vehicles such as converted 4x4s and sports utility vehicles cannot meet the required standards as set out above, in particular in relation to the ceiling clearance level and partitions.  Revenue therefore regards them as category A which is consistent with their passenger transport design.  When deployed operationally, the primary function of these vehicles is to support ground personnel and provide transport facilities for patients to take them from off-road areas to a waiting emergency ambulance. In addition, these 4x4s may not be exclusively used for the carriage of sick or disabled persons, as they may also be used as staff vehicles outside of specific events.</p><p>Any attempt to base VRT classification on the use of a vehicle as distinct from its design would be unworkable legislatively and administratively.</p><p>Many organisations which operate these types of vehicle are already in receipt of significant Government funding such as the Department of Rural and Community Development&rsquo;s CL&Aacute;R programme. The purpose of this funding includes to help maintain their vehicle fleet.</p></reply>

However, in certain circumstances horse racing can be treated as a hobby activity and therefore not liable to tax. Where a horse is moved to training and that activity is considered a hobby activity, then any profits earned which are associated with the racing activity while a horse is in training (e.g. winnings or sale proceeds) are not liable to tax. This also means that any associated costs incurred, or losses suffered while the horse is in training are not deductible for tax purposes. </p>  <p>  This treatment does not apply to horse trainers because it is accepted by Revenue that, where a racehorse trainer who holds a licence trains horses which he or she owns or part owns, the activity is a trading activity.  In those circumstances, the expenses of training the horses may be allowed as a deduction in computing taxable trading profits, and any income from prize money or the sale of horses must be taken into account in computing taxable income of the trade.</p></reply>

Records should be maintained to show that the employer has prohibited its use and no such use has occurred, e.g. communication from employer, photographic evidence of odometer etc.</p><p><b>(c) Employer Allows Private Use </b></p><p>Where an employee has a car provided by his/her employer and  </p><p>- the circumstances in the previous example don&rsquo;t apply; </p><p>- limited or reduced business mileage (if any) is undertaken during the period of the COVID-19 crisis; and </p><p>- personal use is limited  </p><p>the amount of business mileage travelled in January 2020 may be used as a base month for the purposes of calculating the amount of BIK due.  Thus, the percentage applied in the calculation of the cash equivalent, which is based on annualised business mileage, may have regard to the actual business mileage for January 2020, for the period of the COVID-19 restrictions. Appropriate records should be kept, e.g. business mileage travelled in January 2020, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer etc. </p><p><b>Employee Continues Working</b></p><p>Where an employee continues to undertake business travel as usual in an employer-provided vehicle, the usual BIK rules will apply. Further information on the taxation of employer-provided vehicles is available on Revenue's website. </p><p>Guidance on the above, and many other matters pertaining to COVID-19, can be found on Revenue's website*. </p><p>Allowing January 2020 to be used as the base month for the calculation of business mileage in scenario (c) above enables the annualised business mileage to be calculated having regard to the actual business mileage that would likely have been undertaken in the absence of any COVID-19 related travel restrictions. This is considered to be both a fair and reasonable approach, however it is acknowledged that this approach may not cater for every individual situation.  </p><p>Therefore, in situations where an employee did not have any business mileage for their current role in January 2020, for example where an employee has taken on a new role since that time, a reasonable alternative may be used to calculate the annualised business mileage for 2021. The reasonable alternative used should have due regard to the specific role carried out by the employee, and the business travel the employee would likely be expected to undertake in the absence of any COVID-19 related travel restrictions.</p><p>*https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/communications/covid19/index.aspx  </p></reply>

As a result, Budget 2021 was exclusively focused on 2021; to look any further would not seem realistic in the circumstances.

Given the continued constraints on the construction sector&rsquo;s ability to hire labour to deliver a supply of new housing units, similar issues may arise currently with regard to any re-introduction of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The proposal in the Deputy's question would also give rise to additional Exchequer costs.  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, the introduction of new tax incentive measures, or the continuation of  measures which are due to terminate, should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p>  <p>  Having regard to these considerations, the case for re-introducing the HRI along the lines mentioned by the Deputy is not a strong one from the perspective of my Department.</p></reply>

In addition, the grade of the individuals is not available. </p><p>During 2016/17, a major refurbishment project was undertaken by Facilities Management and the OPW in Government Buildings on Merrion Street. As part of that project, for example, electronic doors were installed to assist the movement of staff across the campus. In addition in 2019 an external lift was installed to South Block to allow staff with mobility difficulties to access the building easier. </p><p>The Department of Finance adheres to its requirements as set out by the Disability Act of 2005. The Department does not possess information regarding employees who are registered disabled. Staff can volunteer to self-declare a disability.</p><p>The Department has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) appointed who works closely with the NDA to ensure that the Department is fully compliant with its obligations under the Act.  </p><p>Bi-monthly Disability Liaison Officer Network meetings are held to share knowledge and assist other DLOs across the Civil Service, as well as engaging with staff in accessing training and learning events, where needed.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s website, (www.gov.ie/finance), internal intranet and the Build to Share programmes (ePQ, eSubmission, eCorrespondence etc), which are used by staff in the course of their work, all have software to aid the visually impaired. A &lsquo;loop&rsquo; system&rsquo; is in place in the Department&rsquo;s Whitaker Conference Room for the hearing impaired. </p><p>The Department has also held Power Hours (awareness presentations) in the areas of Autism; Dyslexia in the Workplace and has marked International Day of people with disabilities and it is proposed to continue to do so.</p></reply>

On 6th January Cabinet was informed that the TLAC process for the position in Health was about to commence and that, for the reasons outlined above, it would attract improved terms and conditions reflecting the responsibilities of the post. </p><p>A recruitment process is now underway with the position internationally advertised on 8 January 2021 by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) on behalf of the Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC).  The Minister for Health will bring a memo on the proposed appointment of the new Secretary General once the process is completed.</p></reply>

The OPWs prime responsibility in this area is the management of flood risk. However, the Government has established an Inter-Departmental Group on Managing Coastal Change to scope out an approach for the development of a national co-ordinated and integrated strategy to manage the projected impact of coastal change to our coastal communities. The Inter-Departmental Group is jointly chaired by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the OPW and will bring forward options and recommendations for the Government to consider.</p><p>Coastal protection and localised flooding issues are matters, in the first instance, for each local authority to investigate and address.  To assist Local Authorities in managing the coastline for coastal erosion, the OPW has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion (including erosion rates) under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) and the results of this study have been published on the OPW website. This data enables Local Authorities to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties.  </p><p>The Local Authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources. If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures. Intervention or hard defences has the potential to cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal risk management study that has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options. </p><p>The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme since 2009, under which applications for funding from local authorities for small localised works are considered for measures costing up to &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding for coastal risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects that meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. It is a matter for each local authority to ensure that all the necessary environmental, statutory and regulatory approvals are in place prior to any works being undertaken.</p><p>The OPW guidelines for funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, together with a full list of funding approvals since 2009 is available on the OPW website at .</p></reply>

All local authorities may carry out flood mitigation works, within their own capital works programme and using their own resources, or by applying for funding under the Office of Public Works Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme. The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding within their areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance.

A table setting out the overall carryover request by Vote is set out.  </p><p>It may be helpful to the Deputy if I outline the carryover procedure and the transparent scrutiny that this procedure receives.  </p><p>To begin with, capital and current allocations are set out in the Revised Estimates and are subject to D&aacute;il scrutiny each year before being voted on by all members of the House.  Members vote on the ambit and amount for each Vote.  The ambit for each Vote states the year for which the amount being voted is to be expended.  </p><p>As the amounts are voted for use in 2020 they have to be drawn down from the Exchequer in 2020, otherwise any unspent Exchequer moneys would have to be surrendered to the Central Fund at the end of the financial year.  However, Section 91 of the Finance Act, 2004, gives legal effect to the carryover of unspent Voted Exchequer capital to the following year of up to 10% of capital by Vote, subject to certain conditions, by deferring this surrender requirement. This procedure is designed to promote value-for-money in the use of capital funding, in particular by mitigating any incentive on the part of public bodies to Departments to spend any remaining capital allocation at end-year in an accelerated manner rather than surrender it to the Exchequer. Allowing for up to 10% of the original capital allocation to be carried over into the following year allows for the capital funding to be drawn down in a considered and deliberate manner, that maximizes public benefit.</p><p>While the carryover amount is deferred into the following year, subject to the conditions set out in Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004, it is drawn down from the Exchequer in the year it is voted.  Therefore the carryover is included in the Fiscal Monitor as it has been drawn down from the Exchequer in 2020.  As such, the carryover amount is not classified as an underspend or saving in the year from which it is being deferred as it is funding that is already committed for expenditure.</p><p>To allow for spending of the capital carryover amounts in the following year, I am required to make an Order no later than 31 March of that year determining the capital carryover amounts by subhead which will be available for expenditure. D&aacute;il approval of this draft Ministerial Order is required before I can make the Order. As the Deputy will appreciate, it is a matter for the D&aacute;il to decide on what topics it wishes to debate and on the scheduling of such debates.</p><p>Once the order is made, the carryover amounts become a first charge against the subheads concerned.  If the carryover sums are not spent in the year of carryover, they must be surrendered to the Central Fund.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Capital Envelope </th>       <th>Gross 2020 Allocation</th>       <th>Indicative Carry over from 2020 to 2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 into 2021</td>       <td>&euro;,000</td>       <td>&euro;,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 13 - OPW</td>       <td>204,049</td>       <td>20,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 17 - PAS</td>       <td>2,000</td>       <td>200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 18 - NSSO</td>       <td>14,350</td>       <td>1,435</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 20 - GARDA</td>       <td>127,500</td>       <td>12,750</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 21 - PRISONS</td>       <td>54,689</td>       <td>5,468</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 22 - COURTS</td>       <td>71,017</td>       <td>4,895</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 24 - JUSTICE</td>       <td>39,901</td>       <td>3,900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 29 - DECC</td>       <td>377,477</td>       <td>37,747</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 30 - DAFM</td>       <td>316,030</td>       <td>31,600</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 31 - DoT</td>       <td>1,981,240</td>       <td>151,480</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 32 - DETE</td>       <td>1,551,000</td>       <td>106,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 33 - DTCAGSM</td>       <td>169,424</td>       <td>16,892</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 34 - DHLGH</td>       <td>2,390,335</td>       <td>214,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 37 - DSP</td>       <td>15,000</td>       <td>910</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 38 - HEALTH</td>       <td>1,074,250</td>       <td>68,174</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 39 - OGP</td>       <td>587</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 40 - DCEDIY</td>       <td>41,000</td>       <td>4,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 42 - DRCD</td>       <td>168,644</td>       <td>13,180</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vote 45 - DFHERIS</td>       <td>191,949</td>       <td>16,700</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The decision to award SLWP was made from a public health perspective: so that employees affected by COVID-19 would report symptoms regardless of whether they had high sick leave or not.

Facilities at the gteic will include fixed line fibre broadband, up to date technologies and IT platforms, space for training programmes with a focus on enterprise, upskilling, rural development and local capability development, and the development will be enabled appropriately to facilitate virtual conferencing as well as safe physical gatherings.</p>  <p>  The development of the hub aligns with the key objectives of the of Tascfh&oacute;rsa Idirghn&iacute;omhaireachta U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thaigh - a collaboration of state, educational and community organisations - established in 2017 in response to socio-economic and demographic challenges in Gaeltacht U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thaigh and being spearheaded by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.</p>  <p>  In a broader context, the Deputy may be interested to note that a lack of space suitable for enterprise establishment and location in the area has been identified by the Tascfh&oacute;rsa as a limiting factor to economic growth and population rejuvenation in the area. In order to address this, an invitation to the public to register potentially suitable work spaces with the Tascfh&oacute;rsa was launched in March 2020 but had limited success with only seven responses received to date.  While property registered under the initiative included warehouse and light industrial space in addition to potential office accommodation, it is understood that many of the properties would need substantial renovation.</p></reply>

The Government's clear message at the present time is for people to stay in their homes, unless necessary for those essential reasons set out in the public health regulations. Sporting activity, including the playing of golf, is not considered essential in this context.</p>  <p>  The Government to keen to facilitate the maximum possible level of sporting activity at the earliest possible date once the public health circumstances have improved to the extent required. In preparation for the resumption of sporting activity, my Department and Sport Ireland continues to engage with the various sporting bodies to inform a review of the broader COVID-19 measures for sporting activity, which will be considered by Government at the appropriate time. I can assure the Deputy that the Government wishes to ensure that sport can continue to play the maximum possible role in sustaining people&rsquo;s physical and mental wellbeing and consequently their general morale.  </p>  <p>  In December 2020 , I wrote to all National Governing Bodies of sport seeking submissions on what key modifications, in particular to Level 3 of the Government Framework, can be safely introduced to bring the most benefit to sport.

The sector has welcomed this engagement and to date a total of 42 submissions have been received from sporting bodies. Review and analysis of these submissions is currently under way.</p></reply>

In particular, the crisis has utterly changed the operating landscape for the Tourism, Sport, Arts and Culture, and Live Entertainment sectors.  </p><p>In terms of economic impact, tourism is undoubtedly amongst Ireland&rsquo;s most important indigenous economic sectors.  It is a significant employer, supporting 260,000 jobs prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.  It is estimated that 180,000 of those jobs are either lost or vulnerable. F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimate that some 40% of tourism businesses have closed.</p><p>Similarly, our arts, culture and live entertainment sectors have seen their businesses effectively closed since March of last year.  This includes a range of sole-traders and small enterprises which are at the heart of communities across the country. </p><p>Across the Gaeltacht, businesses and communities alike have suffered a significant reduction in economic activity, job losses, a lack of tourism and educational visitors.  Many businesses are also now facing the double-impact of Brexit, particularly in those Gaeltacht areas in the North Western region. In 2020, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s reported a<b></b>net job reduction of 6% (481) in full-time jobs in the Gaeltacht, the majority of which relate to tourism and related sectors.  <b></b></p><p>All sporting activities are also effectively suspended at this level of the Plan for living with COVID-19, other than some limited events being held behind closed doors.  In addition to the wellbeing impacts of this suspension of activities, the pandemic continues to severely financially impair national governing bodies of sport, particularly those that depend on spectator revenue.</p><p>There has also been an impact on the broadcasting sector, with declining commercial revenues as a consequence of the crisis. I have engaged directly with this sector and measures have been introduced to support broadcasting across radio and television platforms. </p><p>Officials from my Department have been in regular communication with the bodies in these sectors and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the devastating and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 and my colleague, Minister of State Chambers and I continue to engage in this ongoing process.  Efforts have centred around how best to stabilise sectors and ensure their future viability.  This has resulted in the provision of additional gross funding of just over &euro;200 million in 2020 compared to 2019 and further additional gross funding of almost &euro;79 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The detailed breakout of this for the Department and the bodies under the aegis of the Department is published in the Revised Estimates volume for 2020 www.gov.ie/en/collection/e20037-revised-estimates/#2020  and the Revised Estimates volume for 2021 www.gov.ie/en/collection/e20037-revised-estimates/#2021. </p><p>The position as we begin to emerge from COVID-19 restrictions in 2021 will continue to be monitored closely to ensure the sectors for which I have responsibility are supported at this difficult time.  In addition to a range of bespoke measures that I have introduced to support these sectors, the provision of horizontal supports of the PUP, EWSS and CRSS are essential short term supports for the survival of these sectors.  </p><p>I am also working with stakeholders to support recovery and enhance resilience in our tourism, hospitality and arts and culture sectors.  I have published two recovery task force reports and will continue to support the sectors as we move from pandemic to recovery. </p></reply>

In addition, the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 include provisions affording strict protection to a number of species. International trade in endangered species is regulated by CITES, to which Ireland is a party and which is implemented in the European Union via the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations. </p><p>Trapping protected species for illegal trade is a form of wildlife crime. Within my Department, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) has responsibility for species protection and biodiversity at national level, and the implementation of EU nature legislation. </p><p>Conservation rangers stationed around the country deal with enforcement matters under the Wildlife Acts. Their work includes the monitoring of compliance with national and European law in relation to nature conservation and wildlife crime across the country. The team also conducts patrols and site visits to enforce the law and investigate reports of illegal activity. </p><p>My Department works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are also specifically empowered under the Acts to investigate alleged wildlife crime offences and to prosecute as they see fit. My Department will establish a dedicated Wildlife Crime Unit this year which will enhance our ability to better deal with all aspects of wildlife crime.</p><p>Ireland is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In its capacity as the national CITES Management Authority, NPWS is responsible for the regulation of trade in CITES listed species and for meeting Ireland's obligations under the Convention as well as under the  EU Wildlife Trade Regulations, which implements CITES in the EU context. </p><p>In this capacity, NPWS participates actively at EU and international level on CITES matters, including issues around illegal trade in listed species. Concerted action by EU Member States, including Ireland, is important in strengthening the protection afforded to endangered species such as, for example,  rhinos and elephants, both of which can be targeted by the illegal wildlife trade, for their horn and ivory respectively. Other species, such as cetaceans, pangolins and several species of bat are also included on the CITES appendices and are subject to trade restrictions. </p><p>The EU Biodiversity Strategy launched in May 2020, recognised the linkages between biodiversity loss and zoonotic diseases which can lead to pandemics such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. The Strategy highlights the links between human health and the health of ecosystems. It also points to the need for sustainable supply chains and consumption patterns, protecting and restoring biodiversity and well-functioning ecosystems key to boosting our resilience and preventing the emergence and spread of future diseases. My Department continues to engage with colleagues at national level, across the EU and with the European Commission on implementation of the Strategy. </p><p>Finally, officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have participated in discussions at the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) in relation to wildlife and wet markets. I understand there has also been EU engagement with the OIE on this issue.</p></reply>

This includes unauthorised quarries.  In addition, any person or a planning authority may seek a court order under section 160 of the Act in relation to unauthorised development with a view to ensuring that the development works in question are not carried out or continued.  </p>  <p>  There is no cost to my Department in regard to pursuing unauthorised quarry activity. The management of local authority expenditure is a function of the local authority's Chief Executive Officer.  </p>  <p>  Where enforcement action is taken by a local authority, provision to recoup costs is made under section 154 of the Act. If an enforcement notice is disregarded by the person(s) served and the planning authority enters the land to take such steps, including the removal, demolition or alteration of any structure, the planning authority may recover any expenses reasonably incurred by them in that behalf.  An enforcement notice shall require the person(s) served with the notice to refund to the planning authority the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the authority in relation to the investigation, detection and issue of the enforcement notice, any warning letter and costs incurred in respect of employees, consultants and advisers. </p>  <p>  If required, any expenses reasonably incurred by a planning authority may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction from the person(s) on whom the notice was served. Alternatively, costs incurred by a local authority may be secured by charging the land under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, or an instrument vesting the ownership of the land in the authority subject to a right of redemption by the owner within five years.          </p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.</p></reply>

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria.</p><p>Up to the end of December 2020, 1,004<b></b>households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013. The 1,004 households in the scheme represent 1,688 adults and 1,522 children who have remained living in their homes and communities. There are currently 1,212<b></b>active cases being progressed under the scheme.</p><p>A Review of the MTR scheme for borrowers of commercial private lending institutions published in February 2017 explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and identified a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers. My Department and the Housing Agency have worked with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households. As a result of the improvements implemented, an upward trend in case completions has been evident since 2018.</p><p>The MTR Review taking account of capacity within the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector given that sector's role in delivering ambitious targets around new social housing supply, also recommended that alternative funding options, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment, be explored in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale. An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sectors to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model.</p><p>Under this alternatively funded model, a participant from the private sector purchases a property or properties from lenders subsequent to their voluntary surrender by borrowers that meet the MTR eligibility criteria and then enters into a long-term lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for a defined term at an agreed rent, thereby enabling the borrower to remain living in their own home. The outcome from the EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.</p><p>AHBs are an integral part of the MTR scheme and their participation in the scheme has enabled and continues to enable a significant number of borrowers to remain in their homes as social housing tenants.</p><p>In the MTR scheme, AHBs and the private sector participant operate under different funding models. AHBs fund the cost of purchasing units from a combination of low interest borrowings under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) administered by my Department and only available to AHBs, and private finance or other borrowings. While the CALF debt is not required to be paid back to the State for a further 20-30 years, the private finance must be repaid over that period. This debt and the ongoing maintenance and management of the unit is financed from the income from the payment and availability payments made by the local authority and recouped from my Department which are related to the market rent of the property. The private company operates under a lease model, acquiring units with private funding and receiving monthly rents under a long-term lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for the duration of the lease, payments made are related to the market rent of the property. Given the nature of the individual property transaction underpinning MTR, the decision to purchase a property under the MTR scheme is a matter for the particular MTR provider.  It is a matter for each MTR provider to determine its financial viability to purchase a property based on its individual funding approach.</p><p>Where both AHBs and Home for Life Ltd., are invited to express an interest in a particular property by request of a lender, the valuation for the property in question is based on an independent property valuation commissioned by the Housing Agency. Where the provider chosen decides to make a purchase offer on the property, the offer will be on the basis of the independent valuation commissioned by the Housing Agency and it is only the selected provider who can make an offer on the property.</p><p>In addition, both AHBs and Home for Life Ltd. may work directly with lenders to develop joint-agreements to purchase properties at discounts on market values.  Such an approach can achieve a greater number of successful MTR cases.</p><p>The inclusion of an MTR provider from the private sector has facilitated more individuals and families staying in their homes. Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme. In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focused on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears.</p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to strengthen the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and ensure that it is helping those who need it<i>. </i>Building on the significant improvements already made to the scheme since 2017, my Department is currently working closely with the Housing Agency and key stakeholders to identify any further improvements required to the scheme. My Department is currently analysing submissions that have been received to date and the review will examine all aspects of the regulation and operation of the scheme. It will also consider questions regarding the income and occupancy thresholds, eligibility and issues regarding positive equity.

Local authorities administered the Scheme in each of their administrative areas. The Shared Ownership Scheme was discontinued in June 2011 by the then Government.</p>  <p>  The Shared Ownership Scheme was a housing scheme which facilitated access to full home ownership in two or more stages to persons who could not afford full ownership immediately. The applicant initially acquired a share of between 40% and 75% in a dwelling and rented the remainder from the local authority with an undertaking to acquire the remaining equity within a 25/30 year period.</p>  <p>  There were two types of shared ownership loans. "Pre-2002 Index Linked shared ownership loans" and &lsquo;post-2002 shared ownership loans&rsquo;. Loans were made-up of a loan portion and a rental (leased) portion &ndash; most were a 50/50 split. Monthly payments are made on the loan borrowing and also a rental amount was paid. The two schemes differed in how the rental payments are calculated and the effect they have on the underlying rental equity portion outstanding.</p>  <p>  Under the Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme which operated from 1999 until 2002 rent paid did not reduce the rental equity balance. Amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, had the effect of reducing the monthly cost for borrowers and avoid increases in the rental equity balance.</p>  <p>  The more recent shared ownership scheme that operated from 2003 to 2011 sought to address the issue of paying down the rental equity balance by providing a formalised mechanism for the borrower to pay off the rental equity portion over the course of the term of the loan agreement. In effect payments on the loan that exceed the interest rate charged go towards paying off the rental equity balance.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have information relating to specific lending decisions in the period 2003-2010, which would have been the responsibility of the local authority or agency involved. The Dublin Docklands Development Authority administered its own affordable schemes, separate to local authorities.</p></reply>

No. 701 of 2020) which will continue in operation until 31 January 2021. These Regulations include the classification of "statutory planning system activities, insofar as they cannot be carried out remotely" as an &ldquo;essential service&rdquo; specified at paragraph 14, Part 2 of the Schedule to the Regulations concerning public administration, emergency services and defence. This enables the staff of planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to travel to and from their offices as may be required for the performance of their statutory functions. It also enables such staff to perform related statutory functions including site visits and inspections as well as enforcement activity subject to public health and social distancing requirements.</p>  <p>  In addition, for the purpose of facilitating continued public participation in the planning process during the Level 5 restrictions, regulation 4(1) of the above Regulations provides that an applicable person shall not leave his or her place of residence without "reasonable excuse". Regulation 4(2) in this regard provides that such "reasonable excuse" includes the attendance at the offices of a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la to engage in a statutory planning process (including making or inspecting a planning application or appeal, making an observation or submission or participating in a Development Plan process) or inspecting a site notice relating to a planning application.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, it should also be noted in this context that planning authorities are required under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 38) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 180 of 2020) to upload planning applications and related documentation onto their internet websites within 5 working days of receipt or, where exceptional circumstances exist, as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>  <p>  These measures enable members of the public to view documentation online and at planning offices and facilitates planning applications, appeals or other submissions to be made during the Level 5 restrictions. These arrangements may include provision for attendance at the offices of planning authorities or An Bord Pleanala by appointment so that public health and social distancing requirements can be observed by both staff and customers.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the ongoing situation with regard to Covid-19 and may introduce further measures as appropriate, if required.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities. Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.</p>  <p>  The operation of homeless accommodation services are a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum, performed in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.</p>  <p>  While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis, with nine administrative regions in place.  In respect of the Dublin Region, Dublin City Council is the regional lead authority. The Dublin Region Homeless Executive is operated by Dublin City Council and adopts a shared service approach across South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The DRHE provide for the operational co-ordination of homeless accommodation and related services across the region on behalf of the four Dublin authorities.</p>  <p>  All emergency accommodation, whether provided by local authorities, NGOs, voluntary bodies or privately are required to comply with standards and these standards are monitored. The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for homeless services is in place nationally for local authority and NGO delivered services. The Framework was developed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided. In general, the operation of these emergency accommodation facilities is contracted out by local authorities, under service level agreements, to NGOs involved in the delivery of homeless services.</p>  <p>  Local authorities also carry out inspections on facilities that are not covered under the Framework, as they determine to be appropriate. This regime operates in parallel with the NQSF arrangements. The Standards and Facilities Teams in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) oversee all emergency accommodation in the region and seek to ensure that all relevant guidelines, policies and procedures are complied with in order to deliver a safe and comfortable place to stay for service users. The DRHE has an inspection regime in place to deal with complaints and to ensure accommodation is appropriate and safe. This includes engaging with homeless families and individuals on issues arising in their accommodation. The DRHE has confirmed that it has a thorough complaints procedure in place, and that each complaint is fully investigated and addressed in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Separate to the service standards expected of providers via service level agreements, all homeless service providers must meet the requirements of statutory codes, in particular the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Fire Services Acts.</p>  <p>  Monitoring of services and the undertaking of site visits under the Framework and for other facilities are a matter for the individual local authorities. Details regarding the inspections of homeless emergency accommodation are not held in my Department, nor does my Department report on these inspections.</p>  <p>  Financial reports from each region, including the DRHE, setting out total expenditure on homeless services including those services provided through the non-government sector and private emergency accommodation are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link; www.housing.gov.ie/housing/homelessness/other/homelessness-data. Financial reports for 2020 are currently being examined and will be published shortly.</p></reply>

However since 2014, Exchequer funding has also been provided through my Departments Voids programme to support local authorities in preparing vacant units for re-letting.</p><p>Historically the programme has been administered through a &ldquo;call for proposal&rdquo; initiative where local authorities were invited to submit a funding request to support the return of vacant units to productive use within local authority ownership. For 2020, the allocation process also considered each local authorities stock number as a percentage of the overall national stock as this is a more equitable method of distributing the available funding.</p><p>In response to the annual submission of proposed works programmes by local authorities the approval process takes approximately 5-6 weeks. This was demonstrated in the 2020 July stimulus programme whereby preliminary allocations issued to each local authority on July 30<sup>th</sup>and final work programme approvals issued between the 4<sup>th</sup>&amp;amp; 7<sup>th</sup>September.</p><p>It is important that local authorities increasingly move toward a preventative maintenance approach to the management of their housing stock and my Department is working with local authorities to this end.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda.

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations. Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  </p><p>The HAP scheme is underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. Under section 41 of the 2014 Act, local authorities are required to commence the inspection process within 8 months of HAP support being provided in relation to a particular dwelling, if the dwelling was not already inspected within the previous 12 months. Local authorities carry out HAP inspections and any follow up actions as part of their overall private rented inspections programme.</p><p>Given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted on the inspection of all rented dwellings &ndash; not just those with HAP tenancies. The City and County Management Association&rsquo;s <i>Local Authority Resilience and Recovery Plan for living with Covid-19 (October 2020) </i>and its subsequent <i>Local Authority Services Framework for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response</i><i>(January 2021)</i>do not permit rental inspections in Levels 4 and 5. This is in order to protect tenants, landlords and rental inspectors.</p><p>In response to the difficulties caused by pandemic restrictions, some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections. Dublin City Council have led this initiative which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and being asked to confirm that any remedial works requested by the local authority have been completed, and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to so. </p><p>While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. I support these initiatives and my Department is encouraging local authorities not involved in the pilots to consider adopting them. I have committed to providing Exchequer funding for those that do.</p></reply>

It extends the delivery of Housing First nationally, with the introduction of targets for each local authority. The Plan includes an overall target of 663 tenancies in the period 2018-2021 including 220 tenancies in 2021.  The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Health, the HSE and the local authorities.  </p>  <p>  In line with the National Implementation Plan, Housing First is being delivered on a regional basis by the local authorities and the HSE. Contracts for the delivery of services have been put in place in each of the nine regions responsible for the delivery of homeless services with tenancies now in place in every region. </p>  <p>  As of Q3 2020 a total of 459 individuals are being housed under the Housing First programme including 142 individuals who have been housed in 2020.  Complete end of year data for the Programme will be published by my Department at the end of January 2021, as part of the Q4 2020 Homeless Progress Report.</p>  <p>  The regional targets contained in the Plan were agreed by local authorities based on a review of homelessness data and a national survey of the support needs of homeless individuals conducted with service providers. In this regard, it is important to note that the majority of individuals in emergency accommodation do not require the level of supports provided by Housing First.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to an expansion of the Housing First targets.  Research is being undertaken by the Housing Agency to carry out an assessment of need for the supports provided by Housing First which is being used to inform the expansion of the Programme.  I expect this work to be complete and to be in a position to announce an expansion of the Programme during 2021.</p></reply>

To begin delivering on these commitments, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for an affordable housing shared equity scheme. </p>  <p>  Broadly, the objectives of an Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme are to (1) improve access and affordability of new homes for First Time Buyers, (2) stimulate an increase in supply by improving confidence as to the viability of future housing developments to meet increased realisable demand, and (3) support economic recovery from COVID-19 by encouraging employment in the construction and related sectors.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the scheme will be targeted at first-time buyers who are seeking to buy a new home, but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time.  It will help them secure their own home by bridging the gap between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home that is suitable to meet their needs.  </p>  <p>  In terms of progressing any policy proposal, as a matter of course, the initial stages of consultation  involve a broad consideration of the measure under consideration. Schemes are then developed informed by these considerations.  Based on our initial engagements, I am confident that the detailed design of the proposed scheme, which is ongoing, can mitigate potential risks and, importantly, meet important policy objectives to support people and families to buy a new home in the immediate term and support the supply of these homes.</p>  <p>  In relation to the UK's comparable Help to Buy Scheme, the Comptroller and Auditor General C&amp;AG)reviewed this scheme and 2019 concluded;</p>  <p>  -  the scheme was considered to meet the twin objectives set for it to increase housing supply and home ownership levels</p>  <p>  -  the scheme delivered value for money against its own objectives</p>  <p>  -  there was a 14.5% increase of new build homes supply as a result of the scheme and </p>  <p>  -  that buyers who used the scheme have paid less than 1% more than they might have paid for a similar new-build property bought without an equity support. The C&amp;AG noted that this estimate is significantly less than others in the public domain at that time, which ranged between 5% and 20%. The C&amp;AG found that these estimates did not compare similar properties and so did not accurately assess any additional premium paid by those using the scheme.</p>  <p>  -  The UKs Help to Buy Scheme provides an average of 22% equity support to buyers.  Of the 211,000 equity loans made to buyers in England by December 2018, half were fully redeemed in the first five years and avoided paying any interest by doing so.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet approved the priority drafting of the Affordable Housing Bill 2020 which will provide a legislative basis for the scheme in December last.  I published this Bill on 20 January 2021.  Once enacted, the Bill will deliver on key commitments in the Programme for Government.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to launch the scheme later this year and, once operational, it will target Exchequer resources to simultaneously address the key challenges of affordability and supply.</p></reply>

Furthermore, housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of the Exchequer funding arrangements provided by my Department.Therefore, the exact amounts spent by housing authorities on homeless services, as well as the type and operation of homeless accommodation services are a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum established in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  </p><p>Financial reports from each of the regional fora, setting out total expenditure on homeless services including those services provided through the non-government sector and private emergency accommodation are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link; .

Works identified by local authorities included extra toilets or temporary sanitary blocks, running water, additional accommodation where overcrowding exists, site clean-ups and extra refuse collection, and additional units on-site or elsewhere as space permits in order to allow for self-isolation/quarantine.

The Acts apply to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions.   </p>  <p>  Accommodation let under licensing agreements does not fall within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016 which protect tenancy agreements only.  If there is any doubt as to the type of agreement in place in respect of individual dwellings, for example whether a licence agreement or a tenancy agreement exists, the matter should be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for a determination.  Where the RTB determines that a tenancy exists, it can deal with any dispute arising.</p>  <p>  Sections 12 and 16,  respectively, provide for landlord and tenant obligations under the Residential Tenancies Acts. Section 18 provides that  no provision of any lease, tenancy agreement, contract or other agreement may operate to vary, modify or restrict in any way the obligations of landlords and tenants set out in sections 12 and 16.</p>  <p>  Section 134 of the Acts requires a landlord to apply to the RTB to  register a tenancy of a dwelling within one month of its commencement. </p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 provides that a person guilty of an offence under the Acts, such as non-registration of a tenancy, shall be liable on summary conviction to a Class B fine of between &euro;2,500 and &euro;4,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. If the offence is continued after conviction,  the person is guilty of a further offence every day that the offence persists with a daily fine of up to &euro;500 applicable. </p>  <p>  The RTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  A tenant may refer a matter to RTB for dispute resolution services, whether or not the tenancy has been registered. Section 14 of the Acts prohibits a landlord from penalising a tenant for referring any dispute between the tenant and the landlord to the Board for resolution.</p>  <p>  Section 28 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 inserted Part 7A (Complaints, Investigations and Sanctions) into the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended. Part 7A is fully operational since 1 July 2019 and provides the RTB with enhanced powers of investigation and sanction, in respect of improper conduct by a landlord including failure to register a tenancy.   A sanction imposed by the RTB under Part 7A on a landlord in respect of specified improper conduct may include one or all of the following:</p>  <p>  (i) the giving of a written caution;</p>  <p>  (ii) a direction to pay the RTB  a financial penalty up to &euro;15,000; </p>  <p>  (iii) a direction to pay up to &euro;15,000 in respect of RTB costs in investigating the matter.</p>  <p>  A tenant may make a written complaint to the RTB alleging improper conduct by a landlord under section 148T of Part 7A of the Acts for investigation and sanction. </p></reply>

Both Departments are exploring proposals to enable vacant properties owned by patients in long-term nursing home care to be brought back into early use, through adjustments to the treatment of rental income and house sale proceeds derived from a PPR in the financial assessment of income for the purposes of the Fair Deal Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Legislative amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, which comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Health, would be required to address this matter.  Discussions are ongoing between the Departments in this regard in the context of progressing any appropriate amendments through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill, being developed by the Department of Health. I have engaged directly with Minister Donnelly on this issue and arrangements for further discussions at Ministerial level will be made, if necessary, to ensure that satisfactory progress is achieved. </p>  <p>  It will remain a personal choice for any individual as to whether or not they wish to sell or rent out their home, in the private or social rental sector, upon taking up residence in a nursing home.  </p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities. Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.</p>  <p>  The operation of homeless accommodation services are a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum, performed in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.</p>  <p>  While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis, with nine administrative regions in place.  In respect of the Dublin Region, Dublin City Council is the regional lead authority.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive is operated by Dublin City Council and adopts a shared service approach across South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The DRHE provide for the operational co-ordination of homeless accommodation and related services across the region on behalf of the four Dublin authorities.</p>  <p>  Financial reports from each region, including the DRHE, setting out total expenditure on homeless services including those services provided through the non-government sector and private emergency accommodation are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link; www.housing.gov.ie/housing/homelessness/other/homelessness-data.  Financial reports for 2020 are currently being examined and will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies is a framework covering the corporate governance by both commercial and non-commercial State bodies.  As such, local authorities do not come within the scope of this code and are subject to their own statutory governance requirements in respect of the performance of their functions and the publication of an annual report.  </p></reply>

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him/her. In order to meet this requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship by providing acceptable documentary evidence of this entitlement.</p>  <p>  Entitlement to Irish citizenship is determined by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, under which Irish citizenship may be obtained by birth, by descent, or by naturalisation.</p>  <p>  An individual born on the island of Ireland before 2005 is automatically an Irish citizen. For individuals born outside of Ireland, they may claim citizenship if they had at least one parent who was born in the island of Ireland before 2005.</p>  <p>  Individuals born outside of Ireland can also claim citizenship through a parent who was not born in Ireland but was an Irish citizen at the time of the individual's birth, or through a grandparent born in Ireland. Individuals who wish to claim citizenship through these means must have his/her birth entered on the Foreign Births Register (FBR). Citizenship commences after inclusion on the FBR. Further details regarding the process can be consulted at the Passport Service's website.</p>  <p>  There are no provisions for the spouse or partner of an Irish citizen to acquire Irish citizenship solely by virtue of marriage or civil partnership. Post nuptial citizenship was repealed with effect from 30 November 2005. There is no provision to apply for post nuptial citizenship retrospectively.</p>  <p>  An individual may apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation. Minimum residency terms must be satisfied before an individual is eligible for citizenship through naturalisation. The Department of Justice is responsible for citizenship matters, including applications for naturalisation.</p></reply>

A reduced fee is applied on applications for passports for minors in recognition of the fact that a minor&rsquo;s passport is valid for only five years. Most adult passports will be issued for a period of ten years.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that, at a cost of &euro;75 for an online renewal, which breaks down to &euro;7.50 per year, the Irish passport fee compares favourably with the services offered elsewhere.</p>  <p>  Given that any shortfall in revenue would have to be met by the taxpayer, a decision to waive or reduce the application fee for any category of applicant would require careful consideration. It is important to ensure that the major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements which have taken place in recent years can be maintained and further developed.</p></reply>

This includes, under Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs), funding for Diaspora projects, funding for certain projects under the communications budget and the Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund. Details of funding allocated to local authorities for the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021 are set out in the table below. No funding was provided under Vote 27 (International Cooperation) to local authorities during this period. </p><p>In the area of Diaspora support, in 2018 my Department funded the 2018 Global Irish Festival Series, a Diaspora-focused tourism programme delivered by local authorities, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland. This provided support of &euro;100,000 to Limerick County Council and &euro;60,000 to Donegal County Council, as well as &euro;40,000 in marketing for the events and &euro;10,000 for training and evaluation of the programme. A second series was envisaged for 2020-2021, with a two year funding programme, to provide funding for a planning and development phase in year 1 and operational costs for delivery in year 2.  Due to the impact of COVID-19, this was postponed for 12 months. Agreements to support Mayo and Kerry Councils organise and host Diaspora tourism events were agreed last year. My Department will provide &euro;100,000 over two years, with matching funding from F&aacute;ilte Ireland. The Councils will also contribute to the costs of the festival series. My Department plans to provide &euro;40,000 for the planning and development phase this year and &euro;60,000 for the operations and delivery phase in 2022.</p><p>The Department's Reconciliation Fund was established in 1982 to support civil society organisations in creating better understanding between the people and traditions of the island of Ireland, as well as between Ireland and Britain. Over &euro;60 million has been allocated to approximately 2,800 projects during this time. Generally speaking, two funding rounds take place under this scheme annually. The first funding round of 2021 is due to be advertised in the coming weeks and details of funding criteria and how to apply will be available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <i>www.dfa.ie/reconciliation</i>. In the period since 2018, a small number of grants has been issued to support work by Local Authorities, in particular for project initiatives by county museums in the area of commemoration of events of the decade of centenaries.  </p><p>Under the Department's communications budget, my Department has also supported a programme of events to celebrate Africa Day since 2006, including making grant funding available to local authorities to support the organisation of local authority- and community- led events around Ireland. In 2020, my Department engaged with local authorities on Africa Day, but no funding was awarded due to the cancellation of public events arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. No Africa Day funding has been awarded to local authorities in 2021 to date. <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority </th>       <th>Purpose of Funding </th>       <th>2018 &euro; </th>       <th>2019 &euro; </th>       <th>2020 &euro; </th>       <th>2021 &euro; </th>       <th>Fund </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>Cavan County Museum: &quot;Choices Made -   Journeys Taken&quot;   Exhibition</td>       <td>7,500.00</td>       <td>- </td>       <td>-  </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Reconciliation Fund </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>Cavan County Museum: Outdoor Exhibitions Audio  Equipment </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>15,000.00</td>       <td>- </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Reconciliation Fund </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events </td>       <td>8,209.68 </td>       <td>15,000.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>Communications </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>Global Irish Festival Series </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>60,000.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Diaspora </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>Donegal County Museum: &quot;Update and Reprint  of the County   Donegal Book of Honour&quot;</td>       <td>7,000.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>Reconciliation  Fund </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>F&aacute;ilte Ireland </td>       <td>Global Irish Festival Series   &ndash; Diaspora   focused   tourism programme delivered by local authorities</td>       <td>140,000.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>40,000.00 </td>       <td>Diaspora </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal </td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>11,500.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>Communications </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events </td>       <td>6,760.99 </td>       <td>11,300.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>Communications </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>6,670.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>Communications </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>10,871.56 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>Communications </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events </td>       <td>8,675.49 </td>       <td>13,650.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Communications </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>2018 Global Irish Festival Series </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>100,000.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Diaspora </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>Local Authorities Museums' Network: &quot;Does   the Border   Matter?&quot; Conference</td>       <td>5,000.00</td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Reconciliation Fund </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events </td>       <td>5,351.00 </td>       <td>14,900.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Communications </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>Screening of &quot;Project Children&quot; Documentary </td>       <td>2,000.00</td>       <td>- </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Reconciliation Fund </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South   Dublin</td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>6,800.00 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Communications </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events</td>       <td>7,765.13</td>       <td>14,800.00</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Communications</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>Organisation of Africa Day events</td>       <td>1,850.00</td>       <td>3,400.00</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>Communications</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This will be done by publicising EU funding opportunities through social media and website channels, and by providing a direct support service through targeted training and information events. This will particularly benefit smaller organisations. </p>  <p>  The programme was launched last November by The Wheel, the organisation selected as the National Contact Point following a public tender. I am glad to see that activities under the programme are now taking place. </p>  <p>  This new programme is very timely. It coincides with the introduction of the EU&rsquo;s Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, which will release various funding streams for civil society groups over the coming years. It is important that Irish organisations are aware of, and prepared for, these opportunities. Indeed, the Programme for Government includes a number of commitments around increasing EU funding to Ireland, as well as making Irish civil society more aware of these opportunities. </p>  <p>  Further information can be found on the programme&rsquo;s dedicated website: www.accesseurope.ie.</p></reply>

They provide support for Ireland&rsquo;s State Agencies, including through supporting their strategic objectives and activities in overseas markets.  The role of the Mission Network in supporting the promotion of exports is particularly pertinent in markets with limited or no State Agency presence.</p>  <p>  Since the referendum result in 2016, we have been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy in the face of Brexit.  This involved actions across the whole of Government, including through Ireland Connected, to diversify trade beyond the UK market while working to consolidate the exports we currently send to the UK.</p>  <p>  In June 2018, the Government launched the Global Ireland initiative, which aims to double the impact and scope of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025.  Global Ireland's targets include enhanced global engagement, the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy network and strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s State Agency presence overseas.  Each of these measures will increase Ireland&rsquo;s international visibility, facilitate market diversification and intensification, and deepen bilateral relations in support of the Government&rsquo;s economic and political objectives, including in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  To date, the Government has approved funding for new Missions in locations as diverse as Wellington, and Bogot&aacute;, as well as in Santiago de Chile, and Amman.  Plans are advanced to open Embassies in 2021 in Kyiv, Manila and Rabat, and a Consulate General covering the north of England, in Manchester.</p>  <p>  New Missions have been opened in locations chosen on the basis, inter alia, of their potential to diversify our markets, to increase trade and investment with Ireland, and to enable Irish companies to better take advantage of new opportunities.</p>  <p>  As of 1 January 2021 the UK is outside the seamless trading environment of the EU Single Market and Customs Union.  Officers based at all Missions continuously engage in economic and public diplomacy to promote Irish exports and to advance Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity and raise awareness of Ireland as a place to live, study, work, visit and do business.</p>  <p>  They engage on a range of trade-related issues, including market access, regulatory compliance, visas, phyto-sanitary issues, and double taxation agreements.</p>  <p>  The mission network also supports Irish businesses in market, by providing contacts and information, organising visits overseas by ministers, and supporting trade missions, in partnership with the state agencies.</p></reply>

It plays a vital role in protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, as well as protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.</p>  <p>  It means that while Northern Ireland remains part of the UK's customs territory, it is subject to certain provisions of EU law. These EU law provisions are effectively those necessary to avoid a hard border on the island, and include the Union Customs Code and EU legislation across a range of areas necessary to protect the integrity and operation of the Single Market in goods. In short, it ensures that NI traders continue to have access not only to Great Britain but to the Single Market of 450 million consumers - access which is vital for all-island supply chains.</p>  <p>  The EU and the UK last December agreed an approach to the implementation of the Protocol, including in a number of EU-UK Joint Committee Decisions and unilateral declarations, taking account of  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances. </p>  <p>  In line with Article 12 of the Protocol, UK authorities are responsible for implementing the provisions of EU law made applicable by the Protocol in respect of Northern Ireland. EU representatives have the right to be present during these activities, and have been exercising that right. </p>  <p>  At the same time, the Government continues to engage closely with stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including in the business community, on issues related to implementation of the Protocol. We have been consistent in our position that we want the Protocol to work as smoothly as possible for people and businesses in Northern Ireland, and indeed for the island of Ireland. </p></reply>

In 2020, for example, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) highlighted Ireland as "an excellent humanitarian partner", with its funding models "useful inspiration for other DAC donors", while respected international think-tank ODI found Ireland to be the most principled donor in its index, the second successive year in which Ireland scored highest.</p>  <p>  Ireland's official development assistance (ODA) in 2021 will be &euro;868 million, of which &euro;571 million will be managed by my Department.  This enables Ireland's longstanding focus on meeting the needs of people furthest behind, such as those affected by food insecurity and conflict, to be maintained, with a continued emphasis on helping people cope with the impact of Covid-19.

We have always been, and will remain, a strong supporter of enlargement of the European Union, provided that candidate countries met the necessary conditions for membership. In this regard, we welcome the reform agenda underway in the countries of the Western Balkans and the progress that has been made in the areas of security and rule of law. </p>  <p>  The European Commission published its Annual Enlargement Package and country reports in October 2020. In terms of the progress of individual Western Balkan countries, Serbia and Montenegro are both currently negotiating Chapters of the Acquis with the EU. Serbia has opened negotiations on 18 Chapters, with two provisionally closed. Montenegro has opened all Chapters and provisionally closed three. The country reports for 2020 assessed both Serbia and Montenegro as having both made limited progress. Serbia needs to accelerate its reforms and make significant progress in the normalisation of relations with Kosovo, while Montenegro must address shortcomings in the areas of media freedom, fight against corruption and trafficking, and turn its attention to the closing of Chapters.</p>  <p>  Regarding North Macedonia and Albania, it was agreed by the European Council in March 2020 to open negotiations with both countries. It was regrettable that Member States were unable to reach agreement on the draft negotiating frameworks for both countries at the November 2020 General Affairs Council. Ireland believes the draft negotiating frameworks should be agreed at the earliest available opportunity and that bilateral issues should not form part of the accession process. North Macedonia has made excellent progress and should be able to begin its accession process right away with an Inter-Governmental Conference. </p>  <p>  Bosnia-Herzegovina has made limited progress over the last year and faces significant challenges to ensure implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s 2019 recommendations in the areas of democracy, rule of law, fundamental rights, and public administration reform. These are not insignificant, when added to the ongoing migration issues facing the country, which require greater political cohesion. Progress in these areas must be seen before the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered.</p>  <p>  Kosovo is a potential candidate for Membership of the EU. The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo in 2020 noted that the political situation in Kosovo remains challenging. This is compounded by recent rulings of the Constitutional Court calling into question the legitimacy of the current government and thereby necessitating snap elections on 14 February 2021. Rule of law, judicial reform, public administration reform, organised crime and normalisation of the relationship with Serbia are just some of the areas that must be comprehensively addressed in order for Kosovo to advance on its European path. It will be some time before Kosovo can qualify as a candidate country.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to actively support the enlargement process and accession negotiations to the EU.</p></reply>

The rule of law is and should remain a fundamental principle that all EU Member States respect, protect and promote, both within and beyond the EU.</p>  <p>  Ireland has advocated broadly for respect for the rule of law at EU and international level. We believe that it is important for the EU to have the necessary tools to monitor the rule of law across Member States and effectively respond to challenges where they arise. To that end, a number of tools have been introduced or agreed over the past year.</p>  <p>  This includes a rule of law conditionality mechanism agreed in December 2020 as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework and Next Generation EU package for 2021-2027. The mechanism requires Member States allocated funding from the EU&rsquo;s budget, including NGEU grants and loans, to respect the rule of law, which is an essential precondition to comply with the principles of sound financial management enshrined in Article 317 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The mechanism covers breaches of rule of law, the procedure that will apply and possible measures (e.g. suspension of funding, early repayment of loans and a reduction of funding under existing commitments) against Member States found in breach. Once the regime of conditionality is introduced, Ireland will support its fair, proportionate and effective implementation. </p>  <p>  Ireland also welcomed the publication, in September 2020, of the Commission&rsquo;s first Annual Rule of Law Report, which presents a broad overview of the rule of law situation across EU Member States and the EU as a whole. It provides a valuable, impartial assessment of both positive and negative developments relating to rule of law. We look forward to discussing the Irish Chapter of the Report with fellow Member States at a meeting of the General Affairs Council during the Portuguese Presidency in 2021.</p>  <p>  Proceedings against Hungary and Poland under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union are ongoing and there have been a number of hearings at the General Affairs Council. Ireland has actively participated in these hearings - and will continue to do so - highlighting the importance we attach to respect for the rule of law.</p>  <p>  Conversations among EU Member States regarding the rule of law can be difficult, and each Member State has its challenges in this area, but it is important for Member States to be willing to engage on these issues. We will remain open to dialogue on the rule of law and we encourage our fellow Member States to do the same.</p></reply>

The conflict has had a devastating impact on the population of Tigray, and poses huge risks to the stability of the wider Horn of Africa region.  </p>  <p>  Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed declared the end of the offensive in Tigray following the taking of control of the regional capital, Mekelle, by Federal Government forces on 28 November 2020.  However, the crisis is far from over. </p>  <p>  The Tigray People&rsquo;s Liberation Front (TPLF) went into hiding and there are risks of a long-term insurgency, notwithstanding the recent high profile capturing and killing of some senior TPLF figures. There are also credible reports of atrocities, the killing of civilians and ethnic profiling, including outside Tigray.  Communications with Tigray remain very difficult.</p>  <p>  Prior to the outbreak of the current conflict, Tigray had been home to many refugees, displaced persons and local communities impacted by COVID-19, flooding and the desert locust invasion. The humanitarian situation has been greatly exacerbated by the current conflict. Access for humanitarians is severely constrained due to restrictions by the federal authorities and ongoing insecurity.  Reports indicate food shortages are beginning to severely affect Tigray.  </p>  <p>  Credible reports of Eritrean military involvement in the Tigray conflict are a particular cause for concern, as are reports of grave mistreatment of Eritrean refugees within Tigray, strongly condemned by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The overflow of over 60,000 Ethiopian refugees into neighbouring Sudan, the rising tensions at the border between Ethiopia and Sudan, and tensions amongst ethnic groups which spill across Ethiopia&rsquo;s borders into other countries in the region, mean that the conflict risks further destabilising the wider Horn of Africa. The escalation of tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan is also negatively impacting the already stalled African Union-led trilateral negotiations with Egypt on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).</p>  <p>  Ireland is actively supporting the efforts of the EU, UN and wider international community to address the crisis, including through engagement with the African Union. We are strongly supportive of regional efforts to try to find a resolution to the conflict, however progress has been limited to date.</p>  <p>  In contacts with key interlocutors, Minister Coveney has called on all parties to cease hostilities, respect international humanitarian law and begin dialogue, as well as for immediate and unhindered humanitarian access to affected areas. He has condemned reported atrocities and identity-based attacks, and has called for the human rights of all Ethiopians to be upheld.   The Minister continues to engage with regional actors in this regard, including in Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Pretoria, and through our membership of the European Union. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the statement by HRVP Borrell on 25 December on behalf of all EU Member States, which reiterated the EU&rsquo;s deep concern at the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia, stressed the need to protect civilians and respect international humanitarian law, and encouraged all parties to end the conflict and establish dialogue. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided over &euro;2.6 million to date to support the humanitarian response to the Tigray crisis. This includes &euro;1.4 million to Irish NGOs within Tigray, &euro;500,000 to the UN refugee agency to support the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, and almost &euro;750,000 towards humanitarian stocks, and supports for the protection of women and girls. </p>  <p>  In the context of our membership of the UN Security Council, Ireland will continue to advocate for an urgent response to the humanitarian situation, and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p></reply>

However, this is not a task that can be done single handedly and Ireland will continue to work with partners in multilateral fora. </p>  <p>  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is central to the protection and promotion of children&rsquo;s rights on a global level. The Convention contains many clauses protecting children from child, early and forced marriages.</p>  <p>  Within the EU, Ireland has a leadership role on negotiating UN Resolutions on the Rights of the Child in Geneva and New York. Ireland is also a traditional co-sponsor of the UN Resolution on the issue of child, early and forced marriage. This Resolution recognises that child marriage is a human rights violation that disproportionately affects girls and that it perpetuates other violations of human rights. It urges States to enact and enforce laws to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses and to raise the minimum age for marriage.  </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to call on States to eliminate harmful practices such as child, early or forced marriage. At the current session of the Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council, for instance, we made a recommendation to Oman to end practices that are harmful to the health of the child, including child, early and forced marriages. </p>  <p>  Internationally, Ireland has supported a number of UN partners in the prevention of child, early and forced marriages, including UNICEF, UNFPA and UN Women.  Gender equality is a central priority for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign and development policy and in 2019, 76% of our bilateral ODA contributed to gender equality.   </p></reply>

Verified cases of child soldier recruitment were identified in thirteen of these countries. Nevertheless, positive progress has also been recorded including the release and reintegration of 13,600 children in 2019.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Security Council offers us an opportunity to play an active role in combating violations against children in conflict situations. The Security Council has established tools to strengthen child protection and to support international standards on CAAC including a comprehensive monitoring and reporting mechanism.  Ireland has joined the UN Security Council Working Group on CAAC which adopts conclusions on country situations of concern and ensures follow up of the recommendations at country level.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also an active member of the Group of Friends of CAAC as well as the Group of Friends of the Reintegration of Child Soldiers. Ireland continues to combat the use of child soldiers through our development programme, with a focus on addressing the socio-economic causes that contribute to this situation, through providing access to education, skills and livelihood opportunities.</p></reply>

Ireland supports the EU, UN and other international efforts to reduce the influence of Boko Haram and Al Shabaab and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians. Ireland continues to monitor the activities of these groups and to assist populations affected by their actions.</p><p>Ending gender based violence is a core commitment of Ireland&rsquo;s development and humanitarian programmes.  It is a central component of Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security, which commits to upholding UN Special resolution 1325, reaffirming the important role of women in prevention and resolution of conflicts, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction.  Ireland will use its seat on the UN Security Council to ensure that the protection of women is at heart of approaches to conflict prevention and resolution, as well as humanitarian response.</p><p>The UN is active in the Lake Chad Basin areas affected by Boko Haram, through its Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and the UN Peacebuilding Commission. Ireland is penholder together with Niger on UNOWAS at the UN Security Council, working to ensure that UNOWAS has a clear strategic direction in its work of conflict prevention and peacebuilding in West Africa. </p><p>The UN-mandated African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM) supports the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat Al Shabaab.  Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council.  That Committee oversees an arms embargo and other tools available to the international community in support of a more peaceful and secure Somalia, including engagement with Al Shabaab.  This complements Ireland&rsquo;s role as an EU Member State supporting Somalia, including the strengthening of its government institutions.  The EU provides significant development funding in Somalia, and in the countries affected by Boko Haram.</p><p>The EU Council Conclusions of June 2020 reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s commitment to tackling terrorism across Africa, particularly in the Sahel and Horn of Africa.  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to EUCAP Somalia, including the current Head of Mission. In the Sahel,<i></i>Ireland currently has 20 Defence Forces personnel participating in EUTM Mali. Ireland also deploys one expert to the EUCAP Sahel Niger. 13 Defence Forces personnel are deployed in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows us to contribute to international peace and security, protect human rights, and support conditions for sustainable development in the region.</p><p>Ireland also works bilaterally to promote peace and security in areas affected by armed groups. Ireland places a strong emphasis on tackling the poverty, hunger and exclusion which can contribute to radicalisation, including through Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and observer status at the Sahel Alliance. Both groups offer international partners a forum to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin. </p><p>In addition, Ireland works with partners to respond to humanitarian need in regions affected by conflict. Ireland has provided &euro;27 million in humanitarian funding to the Lake Chad region since 2015. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Abuja also contributes funding for those displaced by conflict in North-East Nigeria through its Humanitarian Fund. Ireland has also been a consistent supporter of the humanitarian response in Somalia, providing over &euro;51 million in humanitarian assistance since 2012, including to communities displaced by conflict in Al Shabaab-held areas. With humanitarian needs in these regions likely to remain acute, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-27a.1097.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700077#WRU05400"><p>Along with the EU, Ireland welcomed the cessation of hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan and we hope that the November 2020 agreement can lead to renewed efforts to settle the long-standing territorial dispute. The trilateral agreement provides for a lasting truce and the restoration of economic and transport ties in the region and the early indications suggest that its provisions are being fulfilled by the sides. The agreement however excluded any involvement of two of the three OSCE Minsk Process co-chairs &ndash; France and the US &ndash; and the future role of the Co-Chairs Group has yet to be defined, especially their role in the determination of the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh although work on this is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the call for renewed efforts towards a negotiated, comprehensive and sustainable settlement of the conflict, particularly on the long-term status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Along with the EU, we maintain our full support to the international format of the OSCE Minsk Group to pursue this objective. We believe it is important that the EU also play a role in the post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation efforts. </p>  <p>  The humanitarian situation in the region is severe with thousands affected and displaced persons, a number of whom will not be returning to their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh. In this context I will highlight our support to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which remains the major international humanitarian organisation present throughout the region. The ICRC is playing an indispensable role in providing assistance to affected populations. Ireland provides the ICRC with flexible, un-earmarked funding of &euro;10 million per annum precisely to enable it to respond effectively to emerging crises such as this. The EU, through DG ECHO, has provided almost &euro;4m in humanitarian aid since the recent conflict began. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres made a press statement on 3 December 2020 indicating that the UN is prepared to provide humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  There is also an urgent need for a fact-finding mission on the ground to investigate and verify alleged violations of International Humanitarian Law during the 2020 clashes. Ireland will continue to call for the establishment of such an independent mechanism that is agreeable to all sides, and which will have the necessary tools to establish the facts.</p>  <p>  A final resolution can best be achieved with the support of the international community through the OSCE Minsk Group and by providing real supports to those affected by this conflict. Ireland and the EU continue to monitor the implementation of the agreement closely, with the ceasefire being just the first step towards a lasting peace. </p></reply>

Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees as set out in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, also known as the Mandela rules.</p><p>Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland has raised the human rights issues in Bahrain at the Human Rights Council in the form of national statements and through support to EU Statements.</p><p>Ireland also engages on the issue of human rights in Bahrain through the EU. The EU, through its Delegation in Riyadh (which is accredited to Bahrain) is monitoring the case in question along with a number of other individual cases and inquiries have been made regarding the health condition of the individual.</p><p>At the most recent informal EU-Bahrain Human Rights Dialogue in November 2019, issues discussed included the right to a fair trial, prison conditions, and the overall human rights situation in the country. The case of the individual in question was raised. </p><p>The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, has also made representations to the Bahraini authorities on human rights issues, including the detention of a number of individuals including that of the person in question, as well as the conditions of their detention.</p><p>Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. </p></reply>

At Level 3, all staff are required to work at a strict social distance and the processing of paper based applications and Foreign Birth Registrations which require greater interaction between staff resume. At Level 1, the public counter of the Passport Service will re-open. </p>  <p>  The Passport Online system has improved the ability of the Passport Service to process applications more efficiently. When the service resumed operations in June 2020, the backlog for Passport Online applications was cleared in 4 weeks. Between 1 December and 23 December, all Passport Online simple renewal applications were processed and most complex renewals were processed. First time applications are more complex and take more time to process. </p>  <p>  There are no further measures required to improve the public health infrastructure within the Passport Service. Similar to all work places, social distancing is required so this limits the occupation of buildings but my Department has been working closely with the Office of Public Works on this matter. </p></reply>

The Passport Service have requested that applicants refrain from submitting documents until we resume operations. Applicants will be notified by e-mail when we resume processing. </p><p>There are currently approximately 5,900 paper based applications in the system. The Passport Service plans to resume processing of routine paper based applications such as Passport Express and Northern Ireland Passport Express Level 3 of the framework. These figures are accurate as of 22 January 2021.</p><p>The Passport Service has a great deal of experience in dealing with peaks in demand, and we are confident that any backlog will be cleared quickly. When the Passport Service resumed operations in June 2020, the backlog was cleared in four weeks. It was similar in December 2020 with the majority of the backlog cleared within three weeks.</p><p>The Passport Service cannot provide average waiting times by county as applications are processed in the order of receipt, not by county. However, we can provide the approximate number of applications per county under process as set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Passport Online application under process</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Antrim</td>       <td>2,300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Armagh</td>       <td>500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>150</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>1,400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Derry</td>       <td>700</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Down</td>       <td>1,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>5,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fermanagh</td>       <td>150</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>350</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>750</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>250</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>600</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>650</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>150</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>150</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>350</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tyrone</td>       <td>550</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>250</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>450</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>This is correct to the 20th January 2021. </p></reply>

As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to facilitate the continuity of learning in these circumstances. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p>  <p>  This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p>  <p>  During the current period of school closure schools are required to put in place their plan of action to enable continuity of learning for all pupils.  This involves all teachers who are medically fit to work, including SETs, providing remote teaching and learning to all pupils in their class or on their caseload. </p>  <p>  It is crucially important that the learning of all pupils/students, especially those with special educational needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage and/or early school leaving, are supported at this time.  These supports include teachers engaging with their pupils/students on a regular basis, through a blend of guided and independent learnings tasks and experiences.  Chosen learning tasks provide an opportunity to demonstrate a student&rsquo;s learning in a clear and concise way.  These learning tasks enable teachers to monitor progress and provide constructive, developmental feedback to support learning.</p>  <p>  It is also important that there is two-way feedback between home and school. Teachers are required to ensure that work received is corrected and relevant feedback is provided. Special education teachers should continue to engage with pupils/students and class/subject teachers should differentiate teaching and learning in line with their pupils&rsquo;/students&rsquo; needs to minimise disruption to their learning and progression.</p>  <p>  Following a setback last week to the planned partial reopening of schools, the Department of Education is engaging closely with the education partners to work towards achieving consensus on a satisfactory way forward to ensure a safe phased return of children with special educational needs to in-school learning.  This remains a high priority for all partners at this time.</p></reply>

A member of the local NEPS team undertakes the role of advisory psychologist to respond to queries that the school may have. The school has been advised to contact the NEPS administration staff in the NEPS Kilkenny Office if they need to consult with a NEPS psychologist.  I can report that the school's NEPS advisory psychologist has been in touch with this school to support the staff with their specific queries.</p>  <p>  In addition to casework, NEPS psychologists work with school staff, to build their capability to support the wellbeing, and academic, social and emotional development of all pupils.  NEPS has developed advice and resources for schools, parents and pupils to support the wellbeing of students during the pandemic.  Schools are supported by the provision of a range of further guidance and support from my Department's Support Services and from agencies, including the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), the Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) and HSE Services.

It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The planning work underway is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has met on a number of occasions in recent months.

Following this meeting, the group agreed that there would be an intensive set of engagements in respect of exploring further possible options for the examinations, having regard to the findings of the recent ISSU Report on the 2021 State Examinations.

Details of schools listed on this programme (Additional Accommodation Scheme) can be found on my Department's website, www.education.ie, and this information is also updated regularly. </p>  <p>  In relation to a specific ongoing acquisition, I can also confirm that my Department is currently finalising a site identification &amp;amp; deliverability exercise in order to technically appraise suitable shortlisted sites within 3 relevant school planning areas, (Kildare, Curragh, Newbridge) - for the replacement Curragh post primary school. Preliminary discussions have also commenced with landowners with a view to establishing availability and market expectations on selected lands. Further announcements will be made when it becomes possible to do so. </p>  <p>  Due to obvious commercial sensitivities, I cannot elaborate any further at this juncture but please rest assured that the project (and site selection in particular) is being given due consideration and attention.</p></reply>

For over 20 years, my Department has provided funding to this community-based drug rehabilitation project. The grant allocation is approved on an annual basis, following an application from the organisation annually, with the conditions of funding set out in the annual allocation letter. These conditions include the funding being subject to full compliance with the provisions of Circular 13/2014. A grant of &euro;148,820 was approved by my Department for 2020 to assist in the day-to-day expenses of this organisation. This grant had increased from just under &euro;139,000 in 2015 to nearly &euro;144,000 in 2016, and has been at its present level since 2017.</p>  <p>  In late 2019, the Department began a review of funding of this organisation, as part of a review of a number of other grants provided to organisations providing similar or related services.  A similar previous review was conducted in 2011. It was intended that the review would have been completed by the end of Quarter 1, 2020.  However, owing substantially to COVID-19 restrictions this has not been possible. As the review was not complete, no recommendations have been made on the grant funding for any of organisations that were included in the review. The organisation referenced by the Deputy was advised that it could apply for annual funding for 2021. The organisation notified my Department in August 2020 of its intention to close its services at year end 2020 and there was engagement following this notification between my officials and the organisation's staff to ensure continuity of provision to year end.</p>  <p>  It is understood that the organisation worked with service users following its decision to close to identify alternative service provision for the project's clients.</p></reply>

The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.  This agreement is benefitting 18,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  On 10 December 2020, draft proposals on a new public service pay agreement were agreed following formal discussions between DPER and the Public Services Committee of ICTU, with consultation and input from the sectors including my Department. These proposals will now be considered in detail by the various unions and their members. There is a specific provision in relation to new entrant teacher pay which allows for the skipping of Point 12 of the pay scale which is a further improvement in pay for new entrant teachers. This measure will build on a previous provision which allowed for the skipping of points 4 and 8 on the post-2011 pay scale and will resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers. This builds on the series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through the various pay agreements. It shows the benefits that continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions can bring.</p>  <p>  For clarity, when comparing salary points on the pre-2011 and post-2011 pay scales the number of incremental skips received by a teacher must also be factored into the comparison.  Teachers on the post-2011 pay scale receive such skips, which means they reach point 11 of the pay scale in a far shorter time than teachers on the pre-2011 pay scales. The proposed new incremental skip at point 12 on the post-2011 pay scale, if implemented, will resolve the remaining salary issues.  </p></reply>

We know that many of these children find online learning very challenging. Over the past year, we have all seen how vital in-person education is for children with complex needs. </p>  <p>  This matter has been highlighted not only by the families of the children themselves, but also by all the partners in education, including Parent representative groups, in regular meetings with me Minister Foley and our officials. Everyone recognises that distance learning does not work for every child.</p>  <p>  Recent weeks have seen intense and regular engagement with partners and family representative groups to seek a solution to our shared objective to support children with complex needs return to in-school learning, could be reached.</p>  <p>  My Department sought to agree an approach balancing the need to support our most vulnerable children while addressing the issues raised by trade unions and school management bodies.</p>  <p>  These included requests for clear messaging around public health to be given directly to their members by Public Health specialists, temporary arrangements during the current phase of reopening for high risk staff and for those experiencing childcare difficulties.</p>  <p>  In response my Department set out to the unions how it these concerns would be addressed. This included</p>  <p>  - Temporary flexible accommodations to work remotely or carry out duties where they are not in close contact or providing personal care</p>  <p>  - Temporary waivers to notice periods around parental leave and unpaid leave schemes</p>  <p>  - Speedy turnaround for applications through the National Childcare scheme with subsidies for full time childcare available</p>  <p>  - A webinar to address public health concerns was held by the Deputy CMO Dr Ronan Glynn and senior public health consultants which was directly accessible through online streaming to all education sector staff </p>  <p>  Public Health Officials reaffirmed clearly that schools with risk mitigation measures in place provide a safe environment for staff and children. </p>  <p>  While the general public heath advice is that people stay at home, this does not apply to workers providing an essential service like teachers and SNAs. </p>  <p>  In this context it was considered that schools could reopen for just over 23,000 children with SEN (or just 4% of those who would attend during a full re-opening). These children are those who experience the greatest difficulty benefitting from remote learning.</p>  <p>  We continue to work with the primary teacher and SNA trade unions, INTO and F&oacute;rsa and school management to see if there is a way to return to in school teaching and learning for these pupils as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to pursue every avenue to ensure that children with complex needs can return to in-person learning as immediately as possible and I will continue to engage with stakeholders on the issue. </p>  <p>  In the interim I am confident that schools will continue to make significant efforts to provide effective remote learning experiences for these children.  </p>  <p>  My Department has issued updated guidance on continuity of schooling: supporting pupils with Special Educational Needs (with separate guidance for mainstream primary/special schools and for post-primary schools).  This outlines that teachers in special schools and special classes should make every effort to maintain regular contact with all of their pupils, and where appropriate, make provision for one-to-one online supports.</p>  <p>  Extensive support and advice for schools regarding the provision of distance learning is also available through the Department's support services and agencies including for those pupils with special educational needs.  This includes a dedicated phone line which NCSE has created for parents to get advice and support from SENOs. The SENO will provide support and advice to parents and where relevant provide specific resources e.g. behaviour strategies, NEPS well-being resources. If necessary, parents can book a subsequent appointment with the SENO assigned to their child's school.  This new phone number is 01 603 3456.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools are required to have drafted new admissions policies, which have been approved by the patron, following consultation with staff and parents of children who are attending the school.  The newly revised school&rsquo;s admissions policy is published on the schools website. It is a key requirement of the act that all school admission policies are fair and transparent. </p>  <p>  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied.  The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy.</p></reply>

Analysis of the parental preferences expressed in each area surveyed indicated that there was sufficient parental demand to support changes in school patronage in 28 areas, including in Clonmel.  </p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school can be opened where a school building became, or was due to become available as a result of an amalgamation/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, including in the case of Clonmel, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, my Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.</p>  <p>  To date, it has not been possible to secure a school property to facilitate a new school being established in Clonmel.

The majority of this support is provided by the national teacher education support services and by local education centres. The national teacher education support services are the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT), National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT) and the Centre for School Leadership (CSL)</p><p>Funding provided to the main teacher education support services and education centres for continuous professional development for teachers and Principals since 2018 is as follows:</p><p>2018 &euro;30.898m</p><p>2019 &euro;29.052m</p><p>2020 &euro;22.454m</p><p>The budget allocation for 2021 is &euro;27.104m</p><p>Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of CPD moved online during 2020. This did not effect the level of CPD provided and teachers and school leaders continued to access regular CPD events and a significant range of new CPD supports provided to assist schools with the move to remote teaching and learning. The level of CPD provided was similar to 2019.</p><p>However, the move to online provision of CPD did result in reduced expenditure in 2020 as some of the costs associated with face-to-face CPD provision did not arise. The amount of expenditure on part time associates to deliver face-to-face CPD and on travel and subsistence and ancillary costs reduced significantly.  </p></reply>

Specific guidance had previously been published by the Department to support schools in the context of remote teaching and learning in a Covid-19 context: </p><p>Guidance on Remote Learning in a COVID-19 Context: September &ndash; December 2020;  (Published October 2020) </p><p>This has been complemented by the Department of Education Circular Letter 0074/2020 in relation to the establishment of Digital Communication, Teaching and Learning Platforms:  </p><p>This guidance is intended to assist mainstream and special schools as they endeavour to support teaching and learning for pupils with special educational needs through remote teaching approaches. Key themes of the guidance include:</p><p>- The role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN</p><p>- Teachers and school leaders working to support pupils with SEN</p><p>- Keeping in touch with parents and guardians</p><p>- Keeping pupils with SEN safe in the distance learning environment</p><p>- Resources for teachers</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also communicating directly with schools on the range of supports available to special schools and schools with special classes, this includes a dedicated phone line which has been established for parents to get advice and support from SENOs. The SENO will provide support and advice to parents and where relevant provide specific resources e.g. behaviour strategies, NEPS well-being resources. If necessary, parents can book a subsequent appointment with the SENO assigned to their child&rsquo;s school.  This new phone number is 01 603 3456.</p></reply>

NEPS is organised on an eight-region structure with each region led and managed by a Regional Director.  Currently there are 23 regional and local offices providing service to schools within their catchment areas. Regional Directors report to the NEPS Director.</p><p>NEPS provides an educational psychological service to schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  NEPS psychologists are assigned schools based on a weighting process which takes into account school size, DEIS status, gender mix, numbers of special classes and geographical spread and equating roughly to a 5,000:1 pupil to psychologist ratio.  Depending on local school size and distribution, the number of schools an individual psychologist may be allocated can be within a range of 12 to 40. </p><p>Current Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) numbers of psychologists assigned to each region: <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>No.</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin Mid Leinster</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mid Munster</td>       <td>25</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>North East</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>North West</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South East</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South West</td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>West</td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>205 WTE</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p><p>This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

This funding was allocated as &euro;331 million in 2020 and &euro;308 million in 2021. </p>  <p>  The range of supports being made available to schools under the package has included additional financial supports to provide for extra staffing, management supports, enhanced cleaning, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment costs under the Covid-19 response plans. Funding is also included for the continuation of additional educational psychological services to provide for well-being supports for students and for additional supports for the transport of pupils via the school transport scheme. </p>  <p>  The Government also approved a significant capital package of minor works grants for primary and post-primary schools and an ICT grant to all schools to support them in preparing their buildings and classrooms for reopening and to underpin the delivery of education to our school students.</p>  <p>  Conscious of the fact that the longer term position in regard to Covid remained uncertain, the Government, when formulating the 2021 Estimates, agreed to set aside a central contingency fund for all departments and related aegis bodies to be managed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

This expenditure related to many PUP recipients who had an underlying entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit (Self-Employed).</p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) was introduced on 13 March 2020 to provide emergency financial aid to employees who had lost their job or had been temporarily laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to self-employed workers where their trading income had ceased due to COVID-19.  Between March and August 2020, the entirety of PUP expenditure was charged to Vote 37.  </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020, enacted on 5th August, provides that: &ldquo;Benefit to be paid or provided for out of the Social Insurance Fund shall include such sums as the Minister may estimate on the basis that may be agreed between the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the payments, commonly known as the pandemic unemployment payments, made under section 202 on and after 13 March 2020 to the relevant date&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  This provision allows for charging of a proportion of PUP expenditure prior to August 2020 to the Social Insurance Fund, rather than the Vote, on the basis that many PUP recipients would, in ordinary course, have qualified for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit (Self-Employed).  Following enactment, over &euro;1.8 billion of pre-August PUP expenditure was charged to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  The Exchequer funds shortfalls in the Social Insurance Fund through a Subvention to cover any deficit of income over expenditure in the Fund. An Exchequer Subvention to the Social Insurance Fund was used in the past, from 1953 to 1997 and from 2010 &ndash; 2015 to fund expenditure where there was a shortfall in income from PRSI receipts.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the Social Insurance Fund will be in deficit during Quarter 1 of 2021, at which time a Subvention from the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund will be required. </p>  <p>  The transfer of funding between the Exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund in the future will be dependent on the buoyancy of PRSI receipts and the demands on expenditure, including contributory pensions, to be funded from the SIF over time.</p></reply>

In cases where the parents have an equal custody arrangement, individual payments follow the rules of the scheme concerned.  For example, in the case of Child Benefit, the payment is awarded to the mother in equal custody arrangements as the mother is deemed to be the qualified person to receive this payment under social welfare legislation. </p><p>Either parent can apply for the Working Family Payment and can be awarded if they meet the eligibility criteria.In the case of separated parents one of the requirements is that the person must either be living with the child or children <i>or</i>be wholly maintaining their former spouse, civil partner or cohabitant with whom the child or children are living.  Only one Working Family Payment claim can be awarded in respect of any child.  </p><p>In order to be eligible for One-Parent Family Payment or Jobseekers' Transitional Payment the applicant must be the main carer for at least one child.

JobPath providers are paid on the basis of performance and, with the exception of the initial registration fee; payments are made only when a client achieves sustained, full-time employment.  Job Sustainment Fees are payable for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks. The final overall cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of people who participate in the programme and the number who get sustainable jobs.</p><p>The annual total expenditure on JobPath is as follows:</p><p>2015 - &euro;1.2m;</p><p>2016 - &euro;25.2m;</p><p>2017 - &euro;57.4m;</p><p>2018 - &euro;71.7m</p><p>2019 - &euro;58.6m</p><p>2020 - &euro;36.2m</p><p>2021 - &euro;2m (to date)</p><p>Total - &euro;252.3m</p><p>Between July 2015 and December 2020, some 288,957 jobseekers, consisting mostly of those more than two years unemployed, had engaged with the JobPath service of whom 65,583 (23%) had commenced employment. To date 23,069 of these clients (35% of those who started employment or 8% of the total referred to the service) have sustained full time employment for a period of 12 months or more.</p><p>It should be noted that many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are in the first phase of the service and have not spent sufficient time with the service to have either gained employment or sustain that employment for up to 52 weeks. It should also be noted also that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the numbers gaining and sustaining employment.</p><p>In April 2019, my Department conducted an in-depth econometric review of the JobPath service in collaboration with the OECD. The review measured the effectiveness of JobPath and examined the long-term impact of the service. The review indicated that weekly earnings of people who secured employment after JobPath engagement were 17% higher than the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment without the support of JobPath in 2018.  Taken with the 26% improvement in employment outcomes &ndash; the likelihood of a person getting a job - in the same period, it means the overall positive impact was 37% in 2018 for those supported by the JobPath service.  My Department intends to continue to review the operation of the JobPath programme and will update these findings in due course.</p><p>The JobPath service and the T&uacute;s initiative are not directly comparable. As previously stated, JobPath provides employment assistance and advice while T&uacute;s is a community work placement scheme providing short-term working opportunities for unemployed people. The Department does not collate T&uacute;s progression rates into full time employment.</p><p>It should be noted that jobseekers currently engaged with the JobPath service have the option of applying for a placement on Community Employment (CE) or T&Uacute;S, while continuing to engage with the JobPath service.</p></reply>

They applied for State pension (contributory) on 7 April 2020.  According to the records of my Department, they have a contribution record of 364 paid full-rate social insurance contributions.  As these contributions fall short of the required 520 paid full-rate contributions, they do not qualify for standard State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  Since the person concerned was employed in the public sector for the tax years from 1974/75 to 1989/90, during which period modified contributions were payable, their entitlement to a mixed insurance pro rata State pension (contributory) was also determined, based on their combined modified and full-rate social insurance records.  They qualify for a reduced rate (45.1%) of State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  The person concerned is currently in receipt of the maximum rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  State pension (contributory) and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance can be paid concurrently where the qualifying conditions for both schemes are satisfied.  Where an applicant qualifies for both schemes, the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is paid at half the weekly rate.</p>  <p>  However, in this person&rsquo;s case, they are financially better off to remain on the full weekly rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, rather than being awarded their State pension (contributory) entitlement with half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  They were notified in writing of the pension decision on 5 January 2021 and provided with a copy of their social insurance record on which the decision was based.</p>  <p>  If the person&rsquo;s circumstances change, they should notify my Department and their pension claim will be reviewed.  Additionally, if they consider that they have additional contributions or credits that have not been recorded, they should forward documentary evidence to my Department and their pension entitlement will be reviewed.   </p>  <p>  The person concerned may wish to consider applying for State pension (non-contributory).  This is a means-tested, residency-based payment for people of pension age.  Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the applicant (and spouse/civil partner/cohabitant as applicable).  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This group is comprised of senior representatives of responsible Departments and three external members from the Community and Voluntary Sector and was established to monitor progress and oversee the implementation of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion.</p>  <p>  During this meeting each Department provided the interdepartmental group with an update on the progress of its commitments within the Roadmap.  While the commitments and targets were agreed pre-Covid, the implementation of the Roadmap and delivery of the commitments remains important for supporting the most vulnerable within our society. </p>  <p>  I asked each Department to consider how COVID-19 has affected people who are experiencing deprivation and/or poverty, and other vulnerable groups.  This can then inform policy responses across government to deliver better outcomes in these areas.  The group next meets at the end of March and I will be asking Department representatives for updates on this issue.</p>  <p>  Progress on the implementation of the Roadmap commitments will be reported on an annual basis with the production of an annual report and report card on progress against each commitment and key metric.  It is expected that the 2020 report will be published within the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Parliamentary Question on 3 December referred to the instances of Covid-19 compared with the Pobal areas of deprivation throughout the country.  As noted at the time, analysis of the instances of Covid-19 throughout the country does not fall within the remit of my Department as it is more proper to the Department of Health.  I understand that there are challenges in aligning data on the incidence of COVID-19 with data on deprivation.  However, officials in the Department of Social Protection are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Health, Pobal and other relevant departments as to how this can be addressed.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Intreo provides a case managed employment service and supports to both jobseekers and employers.  Jobseekers, including jobseekers with disabilities, who seek support from their local Intreo Centre, work with a case officer with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.</p><p><b>Local Employment Services</b></p><p>The Department contracts for the provision of Local Employment Services with 22 companies in 26 locations.  Providers deliver a case managed employment service for all, including those with disabilities, who avail of the services. Jobseekers work with a LES Mediator to develop a personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers. </p><p><b>Specialist Employability Services</b></p><p>The Department recognises the additional challenges some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment, and so contracts for the provision of  services to help address this. The Department contracts with 24 companies for the delivery of EmployAbility services in 31 locations.  A jobseeker, with a disability, who is working with their  Intreo Case Officer or LES Mediator may be referred  to an EmployAbility service provider only if it is agreed between the Case Officer or Mediator and the Jobseeker that they would benefit from the type of services and support provided. Providers deliver a supported employment model of services for jobseekers with disabilities.  Jobseekers work with a job Coach who provides both pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.</p><p>There are a number of supports for employers to recruit jobseekers with disabilities or to retain employees who have acquired a disability as follows:</p><p><b>Wage Subsidy Scheme</b></p><p>The Wage Subsidy Scheme is targeted at private sector employers and is aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of financial incentives (a wage subsidy). The subsidy is delivered in three strands:</p><p>- Strand I subsidy is a general subsidy for any productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison  to a colleague without a disability. An employee must work for a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 subsidised hours per week. The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and the amount of the  subsidy is based on the number of hours worked.</p><p>- Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with a disability who are supported by a WSS Strand  I  payment.  Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work based costs relating to these employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number ofemployees with a disability employed under Strand I.  It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability.</p><p>- Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 25 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment  Assistance Officer to support these employees.</p><p><b>Reasonable Accommodation Fund</b></p><p>The Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) assists both jobseekers with disabilities and employers (including the self-employed) to enable persons with disabilities to enter/re-enter or sustain employment by providing a range of grants.  In summary, the fund is comprised of the following four grants:</p><p><i>Employee Retention Grant</i></p><p>The purpose of the Employee Retention Grant Scheme is to assist employers to retain employees who acquire a disability by providing funding to:</p><p>- Identify accommodation and / or training to enable the employee to remain in his/her current position;  or</p><p>- Re-train the employee so that s/he can take up another position within the company.</p><p><i>Workplace Equipment / Adaptation Grant</i></p><p>Where a person with a disability has been offered employment or is in employment, and requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment to do the job, s/he or the employer may apply for a grant towards the costs of adapting premises or equipment.</p><p><i>Job Interview Interpreter Grant</i></p><p>A jobseeker who is deaf, hard of hearing or has speech impairment and is attending job interviews, may apply for funding to have a sign language interpreter or other interpreter to attend the interview with him/her.  Funding can also be provided to cover the costs of an interpreter during an induction period when starting work.</p><p><i>Personal Reader Grant</i></p><p>If a person is blind or visually impaired and needs assistance with job-related reading, s/he can apply for a grant to allow him/her to employ a Personal Reader.</p><p>Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme</p><p>In addition to the RAF, the Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme (DASS) provides funding (a grant) for the provision of  Disability Awareness Training for a company's staff.  The purpose of the training is to deliver clear and accurate information about disability and to address questions or concerns that employers and employees may have about working with and supporting a colleague with disabilities.</p><p><b>Income Supports: and Employment</b></p><p>Both Disability Allowance (DA) or Blind Pension (BP) are structured to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or in insurable employment.  </p><p>When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;120 per week.  In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 is also applied (disregarded), for the purpose of the means test. It is important to note that a &euro;20 per week increase in the DA and BP earnings disregards, from &euro;120 to &euro;140 per week, was introduced in Budget 2021 and will commence in June 2021.</p><p>Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) allows a person who has been in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (the latter for a minimum of six months) and who may not have full capacity for work, to return to employment or self-employment and continue to receive a partial or full payment. There are no restrictions on earnings from employment or number of hours worked under the PCB scheme. </p><p>The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) scheme to support persons including persons with disabilities to become self-employed.  The BTWEA programme has been designed so customers who avail of it retain a percentage of their income support  payment for up to 2 years.  Persons in receipt of a wide range of income supports, including disability allowance and blind pension, are eligible for the scheme.  Details of the scheme are available at </p><p>My Department continues to keep the range of income and employment supports under review. Any proposed changes to the supports provided must also be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-27a.1489.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700084#WRBB04400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 536 and 537 together.</p><p>The experience of past recessions indicates that youth employment tends to be disproportionately impacted by any labour market shock. This is because many employers operate a &quot;last in-first out&quot; protocol when reducing their labour force. Moreover, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, this disproportionate impact is driven by the tendency for many younger people to work in some of the sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic; namely Accommodation and Food and Retail.</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, youth unemployment stood at just over 11% in December 2019 based on the Labour Force Survey data. By December 2020 however, this figure had increased to almost 20%. If PUP recipients at the end of December are included, just under 45% of young people in the labour force were unemployed at that stage. </p><p>It is important to note that the Government extended access to PUP to students who worked part-time, with a significant share of current claimants under 25 self-certifying as students. Using internationally recognised standards set by the International Labour Organisation, these students would not normally be considered, or counted, as unemployed, as they do not meet the standard conditions to be part of the labour force. Therefore the above measures of youth unemployment are somewhat overstated.</p><p>While the employment of young people is significantly affected by the pandemic, we also know from past recessions that youth unemployment levels typically fall quite quickly once economic activity resumes. In addition, the jobs of many persons currently on PUP will not be permanently lost due to the pandemic. Many will return to previous employment once restrictions ease, as they did during previous easing of restrictions during 2020.  </p><p>However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill and to find new jobs. My Department is supporting initiatives to assist people, including young people, get back to work, once COVID-19 restrictions and their impact on the economy and labour market begin to ease. </p><p>In formulating and developing these programmes and services, my Department continues to work closely with, and be advised by, the Labour Market Advisory Council (LMAC) &ndash; a group which is composed of leading labour market experts, representatives of industry and workers and representatives of unemployed people.[1]</p><p>The first task assigned to the LMAC was to develop, as a matter of urgency, proposals for actions to tackle the labour market challenges arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this mandate the Council prepared a Policy Paper &ndash; &lsquo;<i>Preparing for Economic Recovery&rsquo;</i>&ndash; which outlined a series of recommendations for public policy and labour market responses needed to tackle the labour market challenges arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[2] </p><p>Among the key recommendations of the LMAC&rsquo;s policy paper were the call for enhanced employer incentives and subsidies, the expansion of existing work placements and the introduction of new work placement programmes. It also recommended  enhanced cooperation with the further education sector and active labour market measures. </p><p>Taking the above recommendations of the Council into account, which noted in particular the adverse impact of the pandemic on our young workers, my Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are putting in place the following measures, as announced under the July Jobs Stimulus:</p><p>- Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo Centres during Q1 2021 with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment services and supports. Case officer support to help people with job search advice and assistance is shown to be the most effective means of helping people move into employment. These are currently coming on stream.</p><p>- Extending the current contracts of existing contracted public employment service providers into 2021. In particular, the Local Employment Service is being extended into four new areas.</p><p>- Expanding the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people. Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months). This will help make it more attractive to recruit young people who face difficulties in securing a footing in employment.</p><p>- Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.</p><p>- Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited until June 2021.</p><p>- Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months. My Department will actively promote this scheme to suitable candidates and although it is not budget capped, additional provision has been made in Budget 2021 of &euro;3.5million &ndash; equivalent to an extra 700 places.</p><p>Furthermore, building on the success of the Youth Employment Subsidy Scheme (YESS), my Department is now at an advanced stage in developing a new work placement experience programme for those out of work for at least six months. This programme will seek to encourage businesses to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;. There is a target of over 10,000 persons, regardless of age, to be placed on this six-month scheme by end of this year. I expect to launch the Programme as soon as public health restrictions allow in 2021.</p><p>In discussing work placement programmes in it&rsquo;s Policy Paper, the LMAC stated that &ldquo;when accompanied by appropriate upskilling and training provision, these have the potential to provide skilled labour to struggling firms, while offering valuable work experience and retraining opportunities to jobseekers&rdquo;. This is what I intend to achieve, by ensuring that training is an integral component of the new Work Placement Experience Programme.</p><p>Further to those measures outlined above, work is also at an advanced stage by my Department to develop Pathways to Work, the national employment services strategy for the period 2021-2025. This strategy - which represent a whole-of-government approach - will seek to build upon those support measures outlined above as we assist young people on their journey to work.  Publication is expected in early 2021, following the launch of the Government's National Economic Plan.</p><p>In summary, the Council has been, and continues to be, a key vehicle in providing my Department and I with guidance on public policy responses that will continue to support our labour market recovery and assist us to retrain and re-employ all those whose employment has been disrupted by the pandemic, particularly our youth. </p><p>[1] LMAC Membership:  </p><p>[2] Policy Paper, &lsquo;Preparing for Economic Recovery&rsquo;:  </p></reply>

The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility. </p>  <p>  In 2020, the Department of Social Protection introduced a number of other emergency schemes and measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic to support workers while out of work and to facilitate their return to work when feasible. </p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) was introduced in March 2020 to provide support to employees who have lost their job due to COVID-19 and to self-employed workers where their trading income has ceased due to the pandemic.  To facilitate self-employed workers moving from PUP to re-start their business, they can avail of the COVID-19 Part Time Job Incentive where they work up to 24 hours per week.  The Enterprise Support Grant is available to assist eligible self-employed workers by providing a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 to restart their business. </p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), and which is operated on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, provides economy-wide support to businesses with employees, which have been impacted by Covid crisis.  </p>  <p>  These schemes are being continued into 2021 and are reviewed in keeping with the trajectory of, and developments with, the virus.  Any future supports, if required, will depend on what emerges from the medical advice and policy analysis arising from this.</p></reply>

It contains 76 targeted actions which are delivered by Government Departments, local authorities, local communities, the business sector, sporting and arts organisations and NGOs across a number of policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including employment; education and social inclusion. It also addresses racism and xenophobia, representing a whole-of-Government approach.</p><p>  While initially due to end in 2020, this strategy has been extended to the end of December 2021 to enable the actions of the Strategy to continue to be implemented while facilitating the preparations for a new strategic policy approach to migrant integration.  Issues concerning people of African descent in Ireland and the wider black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in Ireland will be examined as part of this work to develop a robust successor strategy to the MIS.</p><p>Arising from the recommendations of the mid-term progress report of the Migrant Integration Strategy, an Anti-Racism Committee has been established to help in the fight against racial discrimination in Ireland. The Anti-Racism Committee has a mandate to develop an understanding of the nature and prevalence of racism in Ireland, and to work towards achieving a social consensus on actions required, by State and non-State.  It is currently working on a national plan to address racism, including structural racism. </p><p>  My Department is also working with the International Decade for People of African Descent  Steering Committee in Ireland to develop a programme of activities to celebrate the United Nation&rsquo;s International Decade for People of African Descent (IDPAD).  This programme will promote the diverse heritage, culture and contribution of people of African descent to Irish communities.</p></reply>

Often, my officials may be notified at a later date through the HSE Anti-Human Trafficking team of an additional support requirement.  I will forward this figure to the Deputy as soon as the relevant information is forwarded from the HSE Anti-Human Trafficking Unit for checking against the IPAS records. Not all International Protection applicants identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as possible victims of trafficking and who are referred to the HSE team seek accommodation through the IPAS, as some do not need it and some wish to return to their country of origin as soon as possible.</p><p>Where requested by the HSE or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, IPAS also provides accommodation to suspected victims of trafficking who are not in the protection process for a period of reflection and rest while considering whether to cooperate with Garda investigations into trafficking. </p><p>It is important to note that services for all International Protection applicants (including health services) are mainstreamed. Protection applicants are linked with primary care services (GPs), are entitled to a medical card while residing in International Protection accommodation and have a waiver of prescription charges.  Applicants access health services through the same referral pathways as Irish citizens including referral to disability and mental health services.  Every effort is made to ensure that residents' specific needs are met.</p><p>Where an applicant is a suspected victim of human trafficking and more intensive or specialist care needs are required, such cases are referred directly to the HSE. In addition, all applicants, including residents of accommodation provided by the State, can be linked into various services for appropriate counselling or other support.  The HSE Anti Human Trafficking team work in conjunction with the IPAS to provide additional support services, linking them in with medical and counselling services, assisting them through the legal process and accompanying them to court appearances, enrolling them to education and employment training and assisting them return home to their countries of origin if they so choose. </p><p>I might also mention that the Department of Justice provides financial grants to a range of NGOs working with victims of human trafficking.  The work undertaken by NGOs funded by that Department includes provision of practical support and advice and includes counselling services.  The Department of Justice has a specific funding agreement in place with an NGO to provide support and assistance to victims of human trafficking that are identified within the International Protection process. </p><p>My colleague the Minster for Justice is also finalising proposals for a new National Referral Mechanism (NRM) for the identification and support for human trafficking victims.  Once in place, the NRM will ensure a multi-agency, interdepartmental approach to the identification of victims and the provision of supports, including access to information and advice, counselling, income maintenance, health services and accommodation as may be required.</p></reply>

Innovative methods are required to achieve this objective, especially given the continuing challenges presented by the restrictions necessary to reduce the public health risks associated with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I want to commence this enhanced dialogue as quickly as possible.

Through this engagement with the Attorney General regarding the proposed information and tracing legislation, I am hopeful that we will have Heads of Bill by end March or early April. </p>  <p>  The Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation will stand dissolved in law on 28 February 2021 and is due to submit its archive of records to myself as the specified Minister by that date. </p>  <p>  My Department is working intensively to ensure that it is properly resourced to handle subject access requests from possibly very large numbers of people who were resident in mother and baby homes.  In this regard, a new Unit has been established to look after this hugely important and potentially significant volume of work. </p>  <p>  There is a considerable amount of work to enable the transfer of the Commission's databases and records.  Furthermore, there is considerable preparatory work being undertaken to establish systems and procedures to prepare for the potentially large number of subject access requests which may be made and to ensure that they can be managed in a timely and effective manner.  This involves the engagement of suitable in-house expertise, consultation with the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commission.</p>  <p>  Department officials are dedicating significant efforts to ensuring the Department is prepared for the transfer of the archives and for the handling of subject access requests in compliance with data protection law. </p></reply>

This is notwithstanding the view that, from a legal and ethical perspective, it may be considered appropriate to leave burials undisturbed wherever possible. In this context, therefore, a burial site must be manifestly inappropriate and meet other certain defined criteria in order for Government to consider an intervention. </p>  <p>  The investigation of burial arrangements of persons who died while resident in Mother and Baby Homes was a key focus of the terms of reference for the Commission of Investigation. It dedicated significant time and effort to advancing its investigations into these matters. As it stands, we do not have reason to believe that the extraordinary and disturbing burial practices such as those at the former &ldquo;Home&rdquo; in Tuam prevailed at any other Mother and Baby institution. Given the extensive investigation of burials conducted by the Commission, with the full suite of powers available to it, it is not clear that further investigation can uncover additional information regarding burial practices or locations.</p></reply>

The Government has also committed to the development of a White Paper which will set out how this new system will be structured and the steps to achieving it.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the White Paper which will set out options, together with the recommended direction, for the new model of accommodation and services for International Protection applicants and the transitional processes needed to implement the model. Options for developing a not-for-profit approach are currently being examined in this regard.  In view of the extent of change proposed, the White Paper will take some more time than originally envisaged and it is now expected to be published in February.</p>  <p>  It is recognised by all involved that the replacement of the current system is complex and that it will take some time.  Therefore, in order to meet our legal obligations to provide accommodation and other support services for protection applicants, existing accommodation centres will continue to operate in the transitional period.  We will focus on the provision of own-door accommodation and facilities to allow for independent living (access to cooking and laundry facilities and communal family areas outside bedrooms) and on reducing our use of hotels and guest-houses as an emergency measure.  In this respect we have reduced the number of such premises currently being utilised to 25 from a high of 44 early in 2020.</p>  <p>  Accommodation centres are currently subject to regular unannounced inspections by both my officials in IPAS and an independent inspectorate company (QTS Limited).   </p>  <p>  These inspections are generally undertaken, twice yearly by my officials in IPAS and once yearly by QTS Limited.  Inspections cover a wide range of issues including the quality of the food quality, fire safety, appropriate signage and information for residents, the condition of communal areas and sleeping quarters and adherence to hygiene and other health and safety measures. Completed inspections are published on www.ria.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently engaging with HIQA about undertaking the role of monitoring the services provided to those accommodated in our centres against National Standards that were published in 2019.  The National Standards meet the requirements of the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive (Directive 2013/33/EU) which we voluntarily opted into in June 2018.</p>  <p>  We hope to begin this monitoring by HIQA in the coming months.  A strong and transparent monitoring capacity is crucial to ensure that quality of service is maintained during the significant transformation process that will occur over the coming years. </p>  <p>  The current inspection programme was severely compromised by the COVID -19 pandemic. All inspections were suspended temporarily during the first phase of COVID-19 restrictions but they recommenced on 14 September 2020 with all necessary safeguards in place.  With the exception of the new accommodatio centre in Dominick Street, Galway (which was not fully occupied until late 2020) all our designated international protection accommodation centres were inspected at least once by IPAS officials with 21 centres being inspected twice by IPAS officials. Furthermore QTS carried out an additional 29 inspections in 2020.  This gives a combined total of 94 inspections carried out in 2020.</p>  <p>  Currently due to restrictions under level 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Living with Covid response, inspections are not taking place but it is hoped to resume them as soon as public health conditions allow.</p></reply>

Such queries may relate to a request for access to personal information which may be available from institutional records.  Where appropriate, staff will provide relevant contact details to callers in relation to any further information they may require.

The Government has also committed to the development of a White Paper which will set out how this new system will be structured and the steps to achieving it. The recommendations of the Advisory Group on the Provision of Support, including Accommodation, to Persons in the International Protection Process will inform the White Paper.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the White Paper, which will set out options, together with the recommended direction, for the new model of accommodation and services for International Protection applicants and the transitional processes needed to implement the model.  Options for developing a not-for-profit approach are currently being examined in this regard. </p>  <p>  A programme of consultations involving Government Departments and State bodies has taken place. The Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and the City and County Managers' Association were some of the bodies included in these consultations.  In addition, representatives of accommodation centre residents and civil society organisations with refugee policy/practice expertise and housing policy/practice expertise (including Approved Housing Bodies) have been consulted.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been made on drafting the White Paper and work is now focusing on testing the accommodation proposals that will be contained in it. In view of the extent of change proposed, the White Paper will take some more time than originally envisaged and I now expect it will be published in the second week of February.   </p></reply>

As a result of the decision to minimise on-site teaching, all universities have confirmed that students who opted to leave their university-owned student accommodation as a result reduced on-campus activity will be offered refunds or rental credits. The processing of these refunds is a matter for the universities themselves, and any student who wishes to receive a refund for their on-campus accommodation should engage directly with their university&rsquo;s accommodation office. </p>  <p>  In the case of privately-owned student accommodation, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances that students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board. </p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 202/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. </p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative.

Financial assistance will be provided to all SUSI eligible students and to EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state.</p>  <p>  The scheme will ensure students;</p>  <p>  - Who avail of the SUSI grant, including students abroad, will receive &euro;250 top-up in their grant;</p>  <p>  - Students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution;</p>  <p>  - In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the monies to students at the discretion of institutions.</p>  <p>  The latter two options are designed to ensure students who are not in receipt of SUSI benefit from the measure. It is also the intention that these address circumstances where students are in final year, have paid their contribution fee and may not be on campus.</p>  <p>  Irish/EU/EEA students partaking in courses in other countries who are in receipt of SUSI support are eligible for the payment if they are attending approved SUSI courses in approved higher education institutions within the EU.  However other EU fulltime students outside of the SUSI system must be registered in a publicly funded higher education provider in the State to avail of this allocation. </p>  <p>  In terms of other Irish nationals studying abroad, the provision of supports to Irish citizens based on nationality alone with the exclusion of other EU nationals would be contrary to EU law. It is therefore not possible to provide supports based on Irish citizenship alone. Instead the measure applies to all of these qualifying for SUSI grants, wherever they are studying and those of EU nationality at publicly funded higher education institutions in the State. Additionally a key administrative feature of the fund is that it is being implemented with the assistance of publicly funded institutions in the State under the remit of my Department.  </p>  <p>  The main support available to assist students with the cost of higher education is the Student Grant Scheme. Students attending approved undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for a maintenance grant provided they meet the terms and conditions of the Student Grant Scheme. There is also a special derogation contained within the Student Support Act 2011 which provides supports for postgraduate students attending courses in Northern Ireland. Such students may be eligible for assistance towards their postgraduate fees up to the maximum fees limit of &euro;6,270 or a Postgraduate Fee Contribution of &euro;2,000 subject to satisfying the terms and conditions of the Student Grant Scheme 2020. There is no other provision under the student grant scheme for the payment of fees to students studying outside of the State.</p>  <p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for certain approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on www.revenue.ie.</p>  <p>  Students may also wish to contact the relevant college in Northern Ireland for advice on the type and range of supports that are available in that particular college.</p></reply>

It is intended to publish an updated set of projections for higher education later this year.</p>  <p>  The scenarios outlined in the projections are driven by two key variables - the projected transfer rate from post-primary to higher education, and the projected increase in international students. Scenario 1, which estimated a steady transfer rate and a moderate increase in international enrolments, projects enrolments of 199,258 in 2021. Scenario 3, which predicts an increased transfer rate and a significant increase in international enrolments projects enrolments of 203,956 in 2021. These enrolments include both undergraduate and postgraduate full-time students, and represent an increase of 13,784 and 18,482 respectively on full-time enrolments in 2018 which is the latest year for which data is available.</p>  <p>  However these projections were developed several years prior to the current pandemic, and therefore do not take into account the impact that COVID-19 has had on demand for higher education. There is more volatility than usual in demand for higher education due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.

This support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education. What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second to third level. </p>  <p>  This commitment is demonstrated through the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education.  </p>  <p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes, the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate Higher Education students.  Students pay a student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum which can be paid in instalments. </p>  <p>  All students eligible for the scheme receive state support whereby the Exchequer pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution. In addition, the Exchequer pays the student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students eligible for free fees at a cost of over &euro;180m. </p>  <p>  Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions will deliver the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site.  While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 202/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. </p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.</p>  <p>  The combined impact of these supports and initiatives highlight the strength of the Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting the costs of third level education.</p></reply>

Local assessment on onsite activities will focus on activities that are not capable of being delivered through alternative means and are time-critical for students and learners during this period. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement on the position with relevant institutions and stakeholders in the light of experience and the progress of the disease and planning for the remainder of the academic year. My Department is working with all stakeholders to identify mitigating actions which can be implemented.</p></reply>

My Department is monitoring developments in this regard very closely. </p><p>From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:</p><p>- teaching and learning, </p><p>- assessment, and </p><p>- qualifications. </p><p>This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p><p>In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place for these qualifications reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. </p><p>Since March 2020, QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU which have taken place in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers. The goal of these engagements has been to ensure that necessary alternative arrangements are in place to maintain the standards of education and training in this area and that these issues are actively managed. These efforts are to ensure that students can progress in their programmes from one academic year into the next, or, where relevant, graduate with the necessary professional competencies that have been set out by CORU. </p><p>Substantial efforts have been made by CORU, QQI and educational institutions to identify and implement flexible solutions for students up to this point. However, further efforts are now necessary.  </p><p>The current timing and the likely duration of Covid restrictions has created greater disruption and uncertainty in this space than anticipated and has substantially impacted on the expected level of available social care placements.  It is in this context that I have asked QQI, supported by my Department, to facilitate intensified engagements between CORU, education providers and relevant stakeholders on this issue.  The focus of these engagements will be to identify solutions that can be swiftly implemented for the student cohort who are most impacted in the near term while also identifying flexible approaches that can be readily adopted within the system in the medium to longer term as the response to the pandemic evolves and changes. </p><p>These engagements will facilitate a dialogue among stakeholders in developing these solutions and, most importantly, will ensure transparency and clarity for those students studying social care.</p></reply>

The selection criteria and process for admission to medical schools is a matter for those institutions in line with their statutory autonomy in relation to academic affairs. Neither I nor my Department have a role in the administration or running of the HPAT.</p>  <p>  It has been a significant priority for me, in the context of the shift to online teaching and learning that has arisen from the public health restrictions, to provide support to students to facilitate connectivity and to examine options designed to seek to minimise the extent to which connectivity challenges act as a barrier to full participation in higher and further education.</p>  <p>  The delivery through the National Broadband Plan of high-speed internet connectively nationwide will ultimately provide a solution to current differences in broadband experience for students and learners. It should be noted that my Department does not have a role in the provision of residential broadband infrastructure. Provision for such services fall to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and this is being addressed through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area. In the interim there are initiatives across a number of Government Departments to facilitate connection through community-based broadband hubs and liaison with telecommunication providers on packages, including unlimited data. </p>  <p>  As part of the &euro;210m investment programme underpinning the  implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools,  the Department of Education provided &euro;100m in grant funding to schools to address their ICT needs during 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions as is the current situation.  Schools can use this funding, inter alia, to acquire software applications or platforms to enable remote learning and communications, and to provide for devices to be loaned to teachers and learners in particular where needed to enable engagement with remote learning. Funding for ICT is issued directly to schools given that schools are best placed to determine the ICT needs of their school community. In addition my Department directly funds the provision of broadband connectivity for schools at a cost of some &euro;13m per annum.  School buildings will remain open to allow staff access where this is essential to facilitate remote learning.</p></reply>

This support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education. What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second to third level. </p>  <p>  This commitment is demonstrated through the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education.  In addition, the Exchequer pays the student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students at a cost of over &euro;180m.</p>  <p>  Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions will deliver the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site.  While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 20/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. </p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.</p>  <p>  The combined impact of these supports and initiatives highlight the strength of the Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting the costs of third level education. </p>  <p>  In terms of student placements, following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) and including the representative bodies of education providers to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of teaching and learning, assessment and qualifications. This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU, in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers, to ensure that necessary arrangements are in place to maintain standards of education and training in this area so that students can progress e.g. from second year into third year or, where relevant, graduate with the relevant professional competencies that have been set out by CORU.  Students should engage directly with their education provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course.  </p></reply>

The plan will also set out how the apprentice population will more closely reflect the general population and further address the issue of barriers to participation in apprenticeship by under-represented groups by offering targeted supports.</p><p>SOLAS conducted a review on Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship which was published in 2018.  It highlighted 5 areas for action to overcome barriers to apprenticeship and facilitate the inclusion of women, people with disabilities and people from minority ethnic groups and the implementation of the report&rsquo;s actions is ongoing.</p><p>A review of the current position of the Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship findings and recommendations together with findings from stakeholders submissions is being used to inform the new Action Plan which will be finalised in the coming weeks. </p><p>Current initiatives underway include:  </p><p>- A total of 300 learners availed of dedicated pre-apprenticeship training in 2019, growing to 580 places in 2020.  </p><p>- Almost 1,000 employers have registered with<i>www.apprenticejobs.ie</i>which is designed to increase visibility of opportunities for all potential apprentices.  </p><p>- Broader approaches to widening access to apprenticeships also include developing links between Youthreach and Community Training Centre (CTC) provision.  </p><p>- There are now 1,000 female apprentices compared to 25 in 2015 </p><p>- The roll out of the 2020 Generation Apprenticeship competition at second level reached 156 second level schools, Youthreach Centres and Community Training Centres  </p><p>- A new user-friendly and interactive website to provide information on, and increase awareness of, apprenticeship was launched in October 2020 (<i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>) </p><p>In addition, Technological University Dublin has developed an Access to Apprenticeship programme. This innovative pilot programme supports the transition of young people (16-24 years old) from areas of socio-economic disadvantage into craft apprenticeships. To date over 118 young men and women have progressed into apprenticeships through this program.  </p></reply>

The investment is aimed at those that require it the most, whether that is to assist with seeking employment or to upskill in their current jobs.</p>  <p>  Building on the July Jobs Stimulus, Budget 2021 will see a total investment of &euro;118.5 million from the NTF to upskill and reskill people who have been affected by the impacts of the current pandemic and in areas of key skills priorities, particularly the climate agenda.</p></reply>

They are referred back either under statutory provisions under sections 94(1) and 94(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) or when a judgement is made by GSOC that the matters under scrutiny fall more at the lower end of the discipline-only spectrum and so are more appropriately dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Unsupervised disciplinary investigations are conducted under section 94 (1) of the Act by Garda superintendents in line with the Garda Discipline Regulations. The Protocols between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na say that unsupervised investigations must be completed and a final report issued to GSOC within 16 weeks. An example of the kind of case that is investigated in this way is an allegation that there was abuse of authority in the manner in which an arrest was conducted.</p><p>In addition, supervised disciplinary investigations are conducted under section 94(5) of the Act, by Garda superintendents also but are supervised by GSOC investigators who meet with the Garda superintendents to agree an investigation plan. The GSOC investigator can direct and partake in the investigative actions, and must receive interim reports.

This is a process whereby complaints made by members of the public to GSOC about service they have received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may be resolved at a local level.  Such complaints are referred to nominated Garda inspectors who will attempt to resolve matters to the complainant&rsquo;s satisfaction.  This is on the basis that cases which involve a service level complaint, of a minor nature, may be resolved quickly and satisfactorily in this manner, thus freeing up investigative resources to deal with more serious disciplinary and criminal complaints.</p><p>The table below sets out the number of cases referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for Local Intervention. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Local Interventions</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>43</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>239</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>263</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals</td>       <td>545</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It is also worth noting that the system utilised by GSOC to manage the Local Intervention process is not automated and dependent on manual data entry.  Similarly, the analytical tools which exist in relation to other areas of GSOC&rsquo;s Case Handling System do not apply to the Local Intervention process.  </p><p>Of the 545 cases referred for Local Intervention, 145 cases were referred back to GSOC for admissibility.

The remit of CoFPI included the review of the police oversight architecture including how complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are dealt with.  Parallel with CoFPI&rsquo;s review, in December 2017 the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) sent proposals to the then Minister for Justice, Charlie Flanagan TD, for fundamental legislative reform, including in relation to GSOC&rsquo;s independence.</p><p>Given CoFPI's remit, the Minister referred these proposals to CoFPI as an input to their work.  The Deputy will be aware that CoFPI engaged extensively with GSOC in its own right as reflected in the final CoFPI Report, which was published in September 2018.  </p><p>The new Programme for Government, <i>Our Shared Future</i>, commits to the rapid implementation of the recommendations of the Report of CoFPI and to the introduction of the Policing and Community Safety Bill to redefine the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to provide a new governance and oversight framework.</p><p>Work on the General Scheme of the Policing and Community Safety Bill is at an advanced stage.  It will, as recommended by CoFPI, include proposals for the reform of the processes for the handling of complaints and the conduct of investigations by GSOC in order to streamline them and ensure timely resolution while safeguarding due process for all concerned. </p><p>Extensive consultations have taken place with key stakeholders, including with GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the course of this work. I hope to be in a position to seek the approval of the Government to publish the General Scheme and to draft the Bill early this year.</p></reply>

All fatal shootings are deeply distressing, and I know that the local community are experiencing real trauma as a result of these events.</p>  <p>  As is the case in every incident involving a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that results in the death of a person, the shooting is of course being fully and independently investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), which is chaired by a High Court Judge, the Hon Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring. </p>  <p>  Such incidents are very rare in Ireland but all are fully investigated independently. GSOC have written to my Department to confirm that they have begun a criminal investigation under section 98 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005. As the Deputy may be aware, GSOC can make wider systemic recommendations on issues they investigate and they are free to do that in this instance also.  </p>  <p>  I know that Garda&iacute; have also been engaging with the local community with regard to the trauma caused by the incident, and family liaison officers from both GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are available to the Nkencho family. </p>  <p>  At the same time, Garda&iacute; are investigating the incidents at Hartstown Shopping Centre and the events leading to the shooting. There are well established protocols in place between GSOC and the Garda&iacute; to allow these parallel but separate investigations to take place.</p>  <p>  Given that these processes are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to consider a separate inquiry at this time.  I will of course give any further consideration appropriate to this matter when the GSOC investigation is completed.</p></reply>

My Department retains responsibility for the processing of international protection applications. </p>  <p>  3,335 people whose applications are being examined by the International Protection Office (IPO) and 1,046 people who are at appeal stage with the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) are currently being provided with accommodation by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. </p>  <p>  The median processing time for all international protection applications determined in 2020, by the IPO was 17.6 months and 12.7 months for prioritised applications. For cases decided in the Ministerial Decisions Unit in 2020, the median processing time was 1.6 months. </p>  <p>  The median processing time for all international protection appeals determined in 2020, by the IPAT was 9 months. </p>  <p>  While the figures above are correct at the time of issue, they are subject to data cleansing.</p>  <p>  Efforts to improve processing times have been seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced the output of decisions considerably and has impacted on the target set by the IPO to make first instance decisions in the vast majority of cases within 9 months.

Work is underway in my Department towards achieving this objective, which includes an end to end process review of the international protection and related immigration processes. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the progress being made on implementing the recommendations there are certain current constraints and challenges for my Department in delivering some of the recommendations of the Advisory Group for reduced processing timelines given the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on current operations.</p></reply>

We have partnered with the UN IOM Office in Dublin on a campaign to raise awareness that victims of trafficking can be found anywhere and can be hidden in plain sight.  My Department continues to engage with the US Embassy here on Human Trafficking issues and we are currently working on our contribution to the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report.</p><p>Addressing human trafficking in a comprehensive way requires the engagement of various stakeholders and a number of key actions have recently been undertaken or are due to be completed soon, including - </p><p>- The designation of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) as Ireland&rsquo;s independent National Rapporteur for Anti-Human Trafficking under article 19 of the EU  Human Trafficking Directive; </p><p>- The commencement of a review of Part 4 of the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which criminalised the purchase of sex as part of a wider approach to protection of persons trafficked into prostitution;</p><p>- Providing funding to NGOs for their work to provide support to victims of trafficking, and to develop targeted awareness training programmes;</p><p>- The engagement of an NGO to identify solutions to the provision of accommodation to victims of trafficking, particularly female victims of sexual exploitation. This was at an advanced stage but post the transfer of functions in October 2021, the follow up and implementation is now for Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; </p><p>- The reaching of an agreement with another NGO to provide off-site support and counselling services for the victims to be accommodated in this new facility, which is now in place and will be funded by my Department.</p><p>- The establishment of a Human Trafficking Stakeholders Forum to consider the current policies, procedures and practices of State services and non-governmental organisations in supporting victims of human trafficking. The Forum will review the existing National Action Plan on Human Trafficking, including to respond to the commitment in the Programme for Government to adopt and implement a comprehensive strategy to combat trafficking of women and girls; </p><p>- Working with the Forum in a review of the National Referral Mechanism in Ireland, learning from best practice models in other EU Member States; </p><p>- Drafting legislation to strengthen the penal framework on people smuggling thereby giving effect to the Programme for Government commitment to enact legislation that encompasses relevant EU measures and enables Ireland to ratify the UN Protocol against the smuggling and trafficking of migrants. The Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Bill 2020 is on the Government priority list for publication by Easter of this year and my officials are working proactively with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to draft this Bill which is well advanced;</p><p>- The hosting of a joint multimedia campaign between the Department of Justice and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to raise public awareness about Human Trafficking. The awareness campaign has two primary objectives; </p><p>1. Raising public awareness around the existence of Human Trafficking in Ireland and educate people to recognise the signs of trafficking;</p><p>2. Raising awareness of victim supports. The campaign highlighted for victims that help is available and how to seek it - in the first instance by contacting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also by providing information on how to contact victim support services offered by the state, NGOs and international organisations. </p><p>The campaign website can be accessed at www.anyonetrafficked.com  </p><p>The Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking was launched in 2016. The Action Plan involves a victim-centred and human rights based approach with the ultimate aims of preventing human trafficking, ensuring an effective criminal justice response and delivery of supports to victims. In line with the Programme for Government Commitment, work to review this strategy will commence early this year.  Great importance is also attached to the work of multilateral international organisations who are active in tackling human trafficking, including the UN, Council of Europe, OSCE and the European Union and Ireland continues to work with all our partners in those forums. A copy of the Second National Action Plan along with an executive summary can be downloaded from .</p><p>In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Ireland. A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been has been in place since 2009 to conduct investigations into human trafficking and provide advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also active in relation to trafficking gangs through work targeting organised crime - targeting their finances, their use of the internet and by working closely with other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

The Act also established the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA), a statutory regulatory body specifically tasked with responsibility for licensing and regulating property services providers (auctioneers, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents). </p>  <p>  Under the Act, any business or individual who provides a property service (other than those who are subject to a similar licence or authentication scheme in another EU Member State) must hold a valid licence from the PSRA.  A property service is defined as the provision, for consideration, in the State, in respect of property within or outside the State, of any of the following: the auction of property other than land; the purchase or sale, by whatever means, of land; the letting of land; or property management services. </p>  <p>  The licensing of property services providers ensures that licensees comply with certain standards aimed at ensuring protection for their clients. For example, licensees must possess specified minimum qualifications, have available to them professional indemnity insurance and pay an annual contribution to the Property Services Compensation Fund. The Compensation Fund is funded by annual contributions from licensees, and maintained and administered by the PSRA.  A person who has suffered financial loss as a result of dishonesty on the part of a licensee, or any principal officer, employee or agent or former principal officer, employee or agent of a licensee arising from the provision of property services on behalf of the licensee, is entitled to apply to the PSRA for a grant from the Compensation Fund to compensate him/her for the loss sustained as a result of the dishonesty. </p>  <p>  The PSRA is empowered to investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensed property services providers, and to launch investigations on its own initiative for the purpose of ensuring compliance by property services providers with their statutory obligations.  Where a finding of improper conduct is made by the PSRA, it can impose a range of sanctions.</p>  <p>  The relationship of landlord and tenant is governed by separate legislation including, in the case of residential property, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).  This Act imposes obligations on both landlords and tenants, including in respect of the refund of deposits.

This is true in terms of commitments and additional resources made available during the pandemic as well working collectively to put in place a comprehensive range of supports and services to meet the needs of victims of domestic abuse. </p><p>In October last year, I published <i>Supporting A Victims Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases</i>, which is a detailed roadmap for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the O'Malley review. A key action of the plan is to increase public awareness of the rights of victims of crime, and of the supports and services available to them. This will be done through the promotion of the Victims Charter, including by the redesign of the Victims Charter website, which will be launched shortly, and the translation of printed material, developed to promote the Charter, into Irish and a number of other major languages, which will be delivered in Q2 of this year.  </p><p>The &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo; awareness campaign was designed and launched by the Department of Justice last March, to ensure those at risk of domestic abuse throughout the pandemic were aware that supports remain available regardless of the level of restrictions in place. The campaign was launched in partnership with the NGO sector and consists of one TV ad, two radio ads and the campaign website. It does not include any printed resources that can be translated into other languages.  </p><p>The 'Still Here' website, which is accessible from the Victims Charter website, has not been translated into other languages and there are currently no plans to do so. However, as outlined above, the work to implement the O&rsquo;Malley recommendations will include information relevant to victims of domestic abuse and will be translated into a number of other major languages.</p></reply>

For cases decided in the Ministerial Decisions Unit in 2020, the median processing time was 1.6 months. </p>  <p>  The median processing time for all international protection appeals determined in 2020, by the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) was 9 months. </p>  <p>  All figures for 2020 are provisional and subject to an element of data clean-up. </p>  <p>  Efforts to improve processing times have been seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced the output of decisions considerably and has impacted on the target set by the International Protection Office (IPO) to make first instance decisions in the vast majority of cases within 9 months. The return to Level 5 restrictions from 26 December 2020, has resulted in the postponement of protection interviews, until an easing of the public health measures permits their safe resumption. </p>  <p>  I welcome the key recommendation of the Expert Advisory Group on reducing processing times for both first instance decisions and appeals to 6 months each, as far as possible.  Work is underway in my Department towards achieving this objective, which includes an end to end process review of the international protection and related immigration processes.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the progress being made on implementing the recommendations, there are certain current constraints and challenges for my Department in delivering some of the recommendations of the Advisory Group for reduced processing timelines given the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on current operations.</p></reply>

The Act also established the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA), a statutory regulatory body specifically tasked with responsibility for licensing and regulating property services providers (auctioneers, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents). </p>  <p>  Under the Act, any business or individual who provides a property service (other than those who are subject to a similar licence or authentication scheme in another EU Member State) must hold a valid licence from the PSRA. The licensing of property services providers ensures that licensees comply with certain standards aimed at ensuring protection for their clients.  For example, licensees must possess specified minimum qualifications, have available to them professional indemnity insurance and pay an annual contribution to the Compensation Fund. </p>  <p>  The PSRA is empowered to investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensed property services providers, and to carry out investigations on its own initiative for the purpose of ensuring compliance by property services providers with their statutory obligations.  Improper conduct is defined in the Act as the commission by a licensee of an act which renders him or her no longer a fit and proper person to provide property services, the commission of a contravention of a specified provision of the Act or of a provision of regulations made under the Act, or the giving by the licensee of a statement of advised market value or advised letting value of land (including buildings) which is clearly unreasonable. </p>  <p>  The Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 (Minimum Standards) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 564 of 2020), which came into effect on 30 November 2020, set out a range of minimum standards to be observed in the provision of property services by licensees to their clients.  These Regulations include, amongst other provisions, requirements that licensees act in a fair, reasonable and just manner, respond to all communications from a client by whatever means agreed within a reasonable timeframe, and act in the interests of their client.  Moreover, a licensee is required to inform the client in writing, as soon as reasonably possible on becoming aware of any conflict of interest, or potential conflict of interest, in the provision of a property service. I am therefore satisfied that the Regulations adequately address the issues of high minimum standards of service, including conflicts of interest, in the provision of property services.</p>  <p>  As I have already stated, failure to comply with the standards set out in the Regulations amounts to improper conduct.  Where a finding of improper conduct is made by the PSRA, it can impose a range of sanctions: namely, issue a reprimand, warning, caution or advice, suspend or revoke a licence.  It can also direct the licensee to pay a financial penalty of up to &euro;50,000 into the Property Services Compensation Fund, up to &euro;50,000 to the PSRA towards the cost of the investigation, and up to &euro;250,000 to the PSRA by way of financial penalty or any combination thereof.</p></reply>

An urgent needs payment may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Rural and Community Development funds the Senior Alert Scheme, which provides grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms for persons aged 65 or older and of limited means.  </p><p>The objective of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to encourage community support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons, of limited means, to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.  I am advised that the grant assistance is made available through community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations that are registered with Pobal. Any decision to extend the scheme to house alarms, rather than personal alarms, would be a matter for the Minister for Rural and Community Development.</p><p>The Deputy may be interested in the work of the National Rural Safety Forum, which brings together An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department and the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development, alongside national and local organisations including the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na T&iacute;re and the GAA. The purpose of the Forum is to develop a nationwide network for the distribution of crime prevention advice, increase engagement within communities and prevent and reduce opportunities for crime.</p><p>The Department of Justice has also for many years provided funding for the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert Programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers. These Development Officers provide support to Community and Text Alert schemes and offer advice on how to establish new schemes. </p><p>This year, the Department of Justice has committed in the region of &euro;150,000 to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme, which is administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re. This is a continuation of the annual funding made available by my Department for the Text Alert Rebate scheme each year since 2016.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of Operation Thor, which is designed to specifically tackle the increase in the number of burglaries and associated criminal activity that usually occurs in the winter months by undertaking targeted enforcement and preventative activity. This year's Winter Phase of Operation Thor began on 1 October 2020 and will run until the end of March 2021. This initiative, which also features the<b></b><i>Lock Up and Light Up </i>public awareness campaign encouraging homeowners to protect their homes over the winter months when burglaries tend to increase, has led to a very significant and sustained decline in burglaries and property-related crime since its introduction in 2015.</p><p>A key pillar of the Programme for Government, <i>Our Shared Future</i>, is building stronger and safer communities and, I can assure the Deputy that the government are committed to ensuring that there is strong, visible community policing right across Ireland, both rural and urban.  </p><p>To this end, the Department has secured an unprecedented &euro;1.952 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Budget 2021. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff. There are now approximately 14,500 Garda members and over 3,100 Garda staff nationwide. </p><p>While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided very dedicated service to assisting in the national effort to combat the threat of COVID-19, ordinary policing has of course also continued throughout the period.</p><p>Finally, my Department is developing a community safety policy, which is aimed at ensuring communities are safe and feel safe, through the establishment of inter-agency structures called Local Community Safety Partnerships. These proposals are contained in the Policing and Community Safety Bill, which is being worked on at present in my Department and the proposed approach will be rolled out and tested in three pilot locations this year.</p></reply>

In addition, some applications may be made and assessed under more than one category, including de facto partner or under health grounds.  However, to be of some assistance to the Deputy, the number of all first-instance applications for assessment as permitted family member of a Union citizen received and approved in each year since the Regulations came into operation on 1 February 2016 are set out in Table 1 below.  </p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Permitted Family Member Assessment applications and approvals</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number of Permitted Family Member Assessment   applications received</th>       <th>Number of Permitted Family Member Assessment   applications approved*</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 (from 01/02/2016)</td>       <td>1510</td>       <td>272</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>738</td>       <td>252</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>487</td>       <td>269</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>477</td>       <td>320</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>431</td>       <td>282</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*the number of applications for assessment approved in a given year bears no correlation to the number of applications received during that year. </p><p>I regret to inform the Deputy that the number of the above applications that were approved whereby the applicant was subsequently granted a residence card at first-instance is not readily available, as statistics are not maintained in a manner that would allow for this figure to be determined without a significant amount of staff resources and time being required. </p></reply>

The table below also sets out the average processing time (in months) for applications in each of the years 2016 to 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Average Processing Time (Months)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>7.80</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>7.39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>10.40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>11.6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>13.5</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In general, the current target is that it should take around 12 months for a standard application for a certificate of naturalisation to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. </p><p>Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service. </p><p>In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.</p><p>Additionally a number of issues have impacted on the processing of citizenship applications over the past 15 months.  A High Court case which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal resulted in significant delays. This has been compounded by the COVID-19 restrictions which have impacted the delivery of normal services to date this year. The combined impact of the Jones judgment and the COVID-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months processing time.  As a result, the processing timeline for standard applications has increased to 12 months.</p><p>I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.</p><p>I was pleased to announce last week that a temporary system is now in place that will enable up to 4000 citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during COVID-19. </p><p>The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and my Department will communicate with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence.</p><p>In addition to the provision of an alternative platform to large-scale citizenship ceremonies, work is well advanced on the following suite of measures designed to deal with the current unprecedented level of demand being witnessed:</p><p>- Additional staffing resources are being assigned to the Citizenship Division. Attendant to this development, restructuring of the organisational structure of the Division is currently underway to ensure optimal customer service delivery. </p><p>- In the context of communications, the Citizenship website has been significantly revamped to make it more user friendly, As part of this process, a new online chat conversation application, or &ldquo;Chatbot&rdquo; called Tara was introduced last December. This provides users with an instant response to frequently asked questions and mimics real-time text or message exchanges with a member of staff. There have been over 4,600 interactions on the Chatbot since it launched. </p><p>- Plans for the digitalisation of the naturalisation process are also well advanced, through increased digital and ICT investment. As part of this process, eTax-clearance for citizenship applicants has been introduced. Online payments have been trialled for applications from minors and the process is currently being rolled out to adult applications on a phased basis.</p><p>The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up additional resources to focus on enhanced customer service delivery, ensuring the integrity of the process is protected and processing applications in a timely and efficient manner. </p><p>  ">Applications</p></reply>

A high level Programme Board, chaired by the Deputy Secretary General, has been established in my Department to oversee and drive forward the implementation of recommendations that relate to my Department and the agencies under its aegis, as appropriate.  In addition, an Implementation Working Group of senior officials from the responsible areas is tasked with working together to support the implementation of actions and to plan for their delivery. This group is meeting on a weekly basis and detailed consideration of each of the recommendations is still ongoing. This includes considering actions to achieve more efficient timelines in processing and deciding applications, and legislation that may be required to support such changes.</p>  <p>  In line with the Advisory Group&rsquo;s recommendations, my Department is committed to achieving a reduction in processing times for both first instance decisions and appeals to 6 months each respectively as far as possible. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in relation to some of the recommendations. For example, additional ICT resources have been secured for 2021 and detailed work including an end-to-end review of processes to guide enhanced processing times is underway. When this first phase of work has been carried out it will enable a more detailed set of milestones to be put in place. </p>  <p>  To date, the Ministerial Decision Unit has been relocated to the International Protection Office enabling streamlining of work processes and the IPAT has been designated as a body authorised to hold remote hearings. In addition, in October 2020 the Government approved, following a review by my Department, a reduction in the waiting period for access to the labour market from 9 months to 6 months and an increase in the validity period of a labour market access permission from 6 months to 12 months. Work on the relevant legislative changes is at an advanced stage with a view to introducing the proposed changes shortly and I expect to make a further announcement in relation to this soon. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the progress being made on implementing the recommendations set out above there are certain current constraints and challenges for my Department in delivering some of the recommendations of the Advisory Group given the impact of COVID on current operations. </p>  <p>  My colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is responsible for progressing recommendations related to accommodation and related services for international protection applicants. </p></reply>

The Department does not directly provide funding to section 39 organisations to replace lost fundraising income. Rather, these organisations are funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide specific health services on behalf of the Executive and this service delivery is governed via an annual service level agreement between the Executive and the agency in question.</p><p>In addition to this ongoing funding allocation for services delivery provided by the HSE to S39 agencies, there were two additional once off funding allocations which were made by Government in late 2020.</p><p>Under the Strengthening Disability Services Fund announced in October 2020, a total of &euro;20 million in one-off grants will be provided to reform disability services, build the capacity of disability organisations and to improve the quality of life of those who rely on these services. In November 2020, the Minister announced &euro;10m in once-off funding for palliative and end-of-life care in 2020 to deal with the challenges posed by Covid-19. The funding was made available to hospices and other voluntary organisations providing services and supports in the palliative care sector. Some, but not all of these service providers, are funded by the HSE as S39 agencies.</p><p>In addition, during 2020, in recognition of the pressures on Section 39 organisations in the disability sector related to Covid-19, the Minister for Health confirmed that disability service providers would not be required to meet previously planned financial efficiency targets in 2020.</p><p>The Government Covid Stability Fund, introduced last year, provided &euro;35 million to assist community and voluntary organisations, charity and social enterprises which experienced financial difficulties due to a reduction in their fundraising or trading income as a direct result of Covid-19. The scheme was intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups delivering front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fundraising or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of Covid-19. Qualifying organisations must have seen their income drop significantly during the crisis. Grants of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;200,000 were available. An additional &euro;10m was made available for the stability fund in Budget 2021.</p><p>The Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD), along with the Department of Health and the Department for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration funded the COVID-19 Stability Fund from the Dormant Accounts Fund. </p><p>DRCD, in conjunction with Pobal, developed the scheme and the application facility based on parameters agreed with DPER and by Government. The fund was administered by the DRCD and Pobal.</p><p>Funding of &euro;44m has been approved to just under 600 organisations to date and the payment processes for this funding remain ongoing. Details of these can be found at: </p><p>104 organisations have been supported through this fund by the Department of Health, with allocations to date of &euro;12.36m. The Stability Fund is now closed for further applications. <table>    <tr>       <th>Status</th>       <th>No.</th>       <th>Contract Value (including top-up)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paid/ready for Payment</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>&euro;11,080,878</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Contract Issued</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>&euro;1,275,208</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Terminated</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Withdrawn</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>104</td>       <td>&euro;12,356,086</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The paper is available online: </p><p>Wastewater surveillance involves the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in sewage samples which will capture both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the community, providing an early warning system that will identify when SARS-CoV-2 levels are increasing in the community. This type of enhanced surveillance doesn't provide much additional information when there are high levels of virus circulating, but it can be an effective early warning system when there are low levels of circulating virus in the community.  </p><p>An inter-agency group has been established to develop the surveillance programme, and work is underway to ensure it is in place for when case numbers reach a substantially lower level.

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This allows for follow up and monitoring of any adverse events.  The HSE is planning for the production of vaccine certificates at part of its implementation planning for a COVID-19 vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  Immunity passports are problematic on a number of grounds. It is not yet clear if the proposed vaccines for COVID-19 actually stop people getting the virus. It is also not clear whether the thresholds for protective immunity are the same in all groups e.g. older persons or those who are immunosuppressed. Thus, it is premature to discuss immunity passports due to the many uncertainties that still exist regarding immunity against the novel coronavirus. The WHO has cautioned Governments against introducing immunity passports at this time and has advised that the focus should be on vaccine certificates. </p></reply>

My Department and the Department of Justice are in regular contact on operational aspects of the pre-departure test requirement. </p><p>In response to the elevated risk presented by new variants of concern of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, the Government introduced more stringent measures applying to travel from Great Britain, South Africa, Brazil and other South American countries:</p> <blockquote> 	- Passengers arriving from these areas are strongly advised to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.<br /><br />- These passengers are also asked to contact a GP to arrange for a COVID-19 test as soon as possible 5 days after arrival in Ireland. The test will help to identify positive cases and for those to be sent to the National Virus Reference Laboratory for genome sequencing to see if variants of concern are identified in Ireland. If arranged through a GP, the test will be free of charge.<br /><br />-  Regardless of the result of the test, passengers who have travelled from Great Britain, South Africa, Brazil or other South American countries are advised to self-isolate for the full 14-day period.  </blockquote>  <p>My Department has issued regular text messages to bring this advice to the attention of passengers who have travelled from Great Britain, South Africa and Brazil. In the case of passengers travelling from Brazil, the texts issue in both English and Brazilian Portuguese.</p><p>On 26 January, the Government decided to implement new measures applying to international travel including mandatory quarantine and testing policies, measures to enhance North South cooperation on international travel and the suspension of visa free travel from certain countries.

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that testing for Sars-Cov2 does not confirm that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. The HSE has worked intensively over the last number of months to put in place a comprehensive testing and tracing operation and despite the very significant increase in demand over the last number of weeks, the median time for community referral to appointment is now 0.2 days with 95.7% of GP referrals provided with a COVID-19 test appointment within 24 hours.</p>  <p>  While rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs) are described as rapid, and simple to perform, they are not designed to be delivered in large numbers. RADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, particularly where there is swabbing capacity on-site, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population.</p>  <p>  Validation studies, both here in Ireland and in Europe are showing significant disparities in sensitivity and specificity of tests versus manufacturer claims. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic patients is much better than in asymptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients, sensitivity results are being shown to be below the minimum performance requirements set by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team has endorsed recommendations on the use of Rapid Antigen Detection Tests (RADTs) as a supplement to PCR testing in certain situations, and particularly when the availability of PCR tests may be limited. The HSE is currently considering the use of RADTs for diagnosis of symptomatic persons and their close contacts in PCR confirmed outbreaks, and / or symptomatic persons where there is a high suspicion of an outbreak, pending PCR confirmation, if faster presumptive results will inform public health action. </p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, in its current form, does not place caps on the financial assessment of family farms or family businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care, except in the case of sudden illness or disability.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to cap contributions based on family owned and operated farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. This change has been approved by Government and undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il.

They have signed Service Level Agreements to provide additional hospital capacity to the HSE, to deal with the current surge in Covid-19 cases and any further surges in the pandemic, if they arise within the next 12 months. </p>  <p>  Under the arrangement, the hospitals have agreed to supply, depending on the incidence of the disease, up to 15% or 30% of their capacity. The HSE will be responsible for invoking the safety net arrangement. The decision will be determined on the basis of any one of three metrics which objectively indicate that a Covid-19 surge event is imminent or present. These metrics cover the level of community transmission, the number of hospital beds in the public system occupied by Covid-19 patients and the number of ICU beds in the public system occupied by Covid-19 patients. The agreement provides that the HSE shall exit the arrangement when the surge ceases. This will also be determined by metrics covering the level of community transmission, the number of hospital beds in the public system occupied by Covid-19 patients and the number of ICU beds in the public system occupied by Covid-19 patients. </p>  <p>  The agreement also provides for additional capacity over the 30% to be made available by mutual agreement between the HSE and any of the hospitals. </p>  <p>  The additional capacity provided by the private hospitals is critical to enabling the public health system cope with large scale surges in the incidences of the disease.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-27a.1980.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700093#WRLL02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 708, 710, 711 and 712 together.</p>  <p>The Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, published in August 2020, made 86 recommendations on a range of issues, including in relation to ensuring that safe staffing is available in nursing homes, that staff should not work across multiple sites, that infection prevention and control measures are in place and that PPE is readily available and utilised appropriately. The Department continues to engage, including through the Implementation Oversight Team and the Reference Group with the HSE as a nursing home provider and with the representative body for private and voluntary nursing homes, on the implementation of the recommendations of the Nursing Homes Expert Panel report.</p>  <p>As you are aware, the epidemiological situation in relation to COVID-19 has deteriorated, including in relation to nursing homes. Preliminary data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) indicates that there are over 180 open outbreaks, which is over 5 times the amount of nursing home outbreaks open in mid-December. As noted by the Expert Panel and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), where there are high rates of community transmission, the risk to nursing homes is high. The HSE indicates that the recent changes in the incidence of COVID-19 nationally and, in particular, in nursing homes have presented significant staffing challenges across healthcare settings. The HSE is indicating that over 1,800 nursing home staff are presently absent as a result of COVID-19. As you will appreciate, this is placing significant challenges on nursing homes. The HSE and HIQA are activating all of the available and established supports; however, staffing, particularly nursing staff, remains a particular challenge  . </p>  <p>  The established serial testing programme for nursing home staff remains a key support mechanism and is now in its seventh cycle. The testing programme is a critical part of the ongoing response to COVID-19 in nursing homes and allows for the early detection of cases and targeting of the early intervention of COVID-19 Response and Outbreak Control Teams. Over the coming weeks, where appropriate, the frequency of testing will be temporarily increased to a weekly basis under the guidance and advice of the relevant local HSE teams in agreement with nursing homes. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the comprehensive range of public health and infection prevention and control advice remains to be of critical importance, including the appropriate use of PPE. The HSE and HIQA has developed and delivered comprehensive training resources and webinars for staff in relation to these matters. </p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need for the HSE to set up a structured support system in line with NPHET recommendations. This has been a critical intervention in supporting the resilience of the sector in meeting the unprecedented challenges associated with COVID-19.</p>  <p>  These supports remain in place and have encompassed:  </p>  <p>  - Enhanced HSE engagement </p>  <p>  - Temporary HSE governance arrangements </p>  <p>  - Multidisciplinary clinical supports at CHO level through 23 COVID-19 Response Teams </p>  <p>  - Access to supply lines for PPE, medical oxygen etc </p>  <p>  - Serial testing in nursing homes </p>  <p>  - Access to staff from community and acute hospitals  </p>  <p>  - Suite of focused guidance, including comprehensive guidance on visiting nursing homes </p>  <p>  - HIQA COVID-19 quality assurance regulatory framework</p>  <p>   The Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme which provides additional funding to private and voluntary nursing homes that require it has been extended until the end of June 2021. Given the importance of facilitating safe visiting over the winter period, it was decided to expand the eligibility criteria under TAPS on a once-off basis to allow a claim of up to &euro;2,500 per eligible nursing home as a contribution towards the cost of visiting infrastructure.  This was intended to support nursing homes in creating additional safe visiting spaces and enhancing current visiting spaces.  As of 21 January, there have been 4,845 claims processed, with total payments of over &euro;63.6m of direct financial support provided to the sector. </p>  <p>  Since 2009 the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the statutory independent regulator in place for the nursing home sector, whether a HSE managed or a private nursing home.  The functions and powers of the Chief Inspector are set out in Parts 7, 8 and 9 of the Health Act 2007 (as amended).  The Statutory powers include the cancellation of registration under section 51 of the Act and the urgent action under section 59 of the Act to attach, vary or remove a condition of registration or cancellation of registration.  </p>  <p>  In the first instance, the primary responsibility for the provision of safe care and service to nursing home residents&rsquo; rests with individual nursing home operators.  If the Chief Inspector cancels a registration under section 51 and the cancellation takes effect, or if the Chief Inspector obtains an order to cancel a registration in accordance with section 59 and the cancellation takes effect then under section 64 of the Act the Chief Inspector notifies the HSE of the cancellation of the registration and of the date on which this takes effect.  The HSE must make alternative arrangements, as soon as practicable for residents where registration has been cancelled and closure orders have been secured by HIQA.  Pending these alternative arrangements, the HSE, either with the consent of the registered provider or by order of the District Court shall take charge of the designated centre.  </p>  <p>  The first stage of the Covid-19 Vaccine Programme commenced on 29th December in hospital settings with the aim of moving quickly to commence vaccinations in nursing homes spread across the country with an estimated 29,000 residents and c.41,000 staff.  Last week, the HSE completed roll out of the first vaccine dose to the majority of residents and staff in nursing homes. Due to outbreaks of Covid-19, a very small number of facilities were not included in this first series of vaccinations on public health advice, while, in a significant number, not all residents or staff could be included in the vaccination programme due to their Covid status. Those residents and staff who were unable to receive a first dose will be included once deemed safe to do so. This week, roll out of the second vaccine dose will begin in 27 nursing homes.</p>  <p>  As a number of the issues raised by the Deputy are service matters I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible. </p></reply>

This is an increase of 6,357 WTE since the end of December 2019. Nursing and Midwifery had the largest yearly growth in 2020, with an increase of 1,712 WTE. These impressive increases are due to a variety of COVID-related initiatives, along with recruitment provided for under the Winter Plan and Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  The Winter Plan 2020/2021 outlined the need for 12,522 additional staff, while Budget 2021 made funds available for these staff and an additional 3,216. Together with the HSE, we are aiming to increase the health sector workforce by 15,838 WTE, from Budget 2020 funded levels. Provisional HSE end of 2020 WTE targets aimed for an increase of 4,155 WTE. The end of year actual increase of 6,357 WTE is already ahead of this projection. We are delighted with this strong progress that has already been made towards the long-term strengthening of the health service. My Department continues to work with the HSE to ensure the 2021 targets are met.</p>  <p>  Regarding the hiring of staff who worked in private nursing homes, applications for posts in the HSE are open to all candidates that display the desired skills and qualifications for the post applied for.  The HSE is not targeting, nor does it intend to target the staff of nursing homes in any of its recruitment campaigns. Hospital Groups and the Community Health Organisations are cognisant of the staffing difficulties faced by the nursing home sector during the current pandemic. Indeed, the HSE are very much aware of the interdependencies of their services in the provision of care to nursing home clients. </p>  <p>  Recruitment in the HSE is subject to the provisions of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 and is regulated by the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA). This regulatory framework provides that recruitment in the HSE must centre on the following five recruitment principles:  Probity, Merit, Best Practice, Fairness and Transparency.   </p>  <p>  The HSE cannot exclude nursing homes staff from applying for positions or prevent them from taking up offers of employment for prolonged periods of time; it would be a breach of its Recruitment Licence to do so. It is ultimately the personal choice of any individual to determine whether or not they wish to apply for employment with the HSE, and many factors will influence such a decision. Those who are successful at competition are entitled to take up the role offered to them. In such cases, the HSE will facilitate generous notice periods to support nursing homes to recruit replacement staff.</p></reply>

There are a number of factors which may affect the waiting times for older patients. In particular, people in the over-75 age category presenting to EDs are more likely to have complex needs and require admission to hospital than the population generally. </p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures in 2020 to defer most scheduled care activity in March, April, and May. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.</p>  <p>   The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. </p>  <p>  This winter is particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The HSE Winter Plan, supported by an additional &euro;600m investment in health services, aims to reduce the number of patients waiting on trolleys for hospital admission and reduce Emergency Department waiting times while ensuring that patients and staff alike are protected in the Covid-19 environment.</p>  <p>  There are specific supports in the Winter Plan for those at greater risk including older people, the homeless, and people with chronic illnesses, facilitated through additional Community Healthcare Networks, Community Specialist Teams, and Frailty Intervention Therapy Teams operating within acute hospital EDs. These measures will create the foundation and organisational structure through which integrated care will be provided locally within the community at the appropriate level of complexity. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Patient safety remains at the forefront of the HSE decision to defer elective scheduled care activity.</p>  <p>  While Inpatient/Daycase waiting lists reached a peak in May 2020 as a result of the deferral of non urgent elective care, steps taken by the HSE to improve patient pathways in the context of the pandemic, and secure new routes to treatment had a positive impact on the overall waiting list. The number waiting for a hospital appointment/procedure dropped by 17% from May to December 2020.</p>  <p>  However it should be noted in this context that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity in the community sector as it has in the acute sector.  Community services are facing equivalent challenges in relation to business and staffing capacity and,  in this sense, the ability of the community sector to act as a substitute for the acute sector is limited.  It should also be noted that many inpatients may require specialised care that cannot simply be transferred into  a community setting. </p>  <p>   At the same time, there is a commitment to progressing a strategic agenda that responds to the needs of our population and to demographic trends in line with the vision set out in Sl&aacute;intecare.   Community healthcare spans primary care services, social inclusion services, older persons&rsquo; and palliative care services, disability services and mental health services.  These services will be significantly strengthened in 2021, facilitated by over &euro;900m in increased funding across a range of reform and investment programmes. This will in turn ease pressure on our hospitals and allow more care to be delivered at home or as close to the patient&rsquo;s home as possible.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Strategic Framework for Delivery of Service Continuity in a COVID Environment (HSE, June 2020), focusses on restoring our services in a prioritised manner with investments targeted at rebuilding services guided by the principles and priorities of Sl&aacute;intecare. A Community First approach to the delivery of care will be central to delivering safe, efficient and effective services through winter and beyond. Service delivery will be re-oriented towards general practice, primary care and community-based services. By &lsquo;shifting services left&rsquo; and prioritising Primary Care and Community Services, the goals of Sl&aacute;intecare will be advanced and may mitigate the impact of COVID-19. The enhancement of community services will also allow people to remain at home, prioritising older people and those with chronic conditions.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. An applicant to the scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.</p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. Assets include cash assets and all forms of property whether situated in the State or not. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence (PPR) is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been designated by the Minister for Health pursuant to Section 40 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 as a body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of non-HSE registered nursing homes to reach agreement in relation to the maximum price(s) that can be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to NHSS residents. </p>  <p>  As part of this function, the NTPF will enter into "Approved Nursing Home Agreements" with registered private and voluntary nursing homes to record the maximum price(s) that have been negotiated.  </p>  <p>  - The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that: </p>  <p>  - Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care; </p>  <p>  - An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;</p>  <p>  - If an applicant has a spouse/partner remaining at home, they will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater; </p>  <p>  - If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater; </p>  <p>  - Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence; </p>  <p>  - A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These actions are centred around the provision of a dementia and delirium care pathway, including through emergency departments, and the assignment of a senior clinician to lead the development and implementation of the pathway. The Strategy emphasises the importance of an integrated and multi-disciplinary response by care providers. Hospitals should be dementia-friendly, people with dementia should spend no longer than is absolutely necessary in hospital, and staff should have the training necessary to treat and support the person with dementia. </p>  <p>  The second national audit of dementia in acute hospitals, which was published in 2019, shows that there have been improvements in dementia hospital care since the first audit in 2013, and highlights the need for further work in areas including delirium screening, dementia pathways and staff training. The National Dementia Office in the HSE has produced a range of online resources to support acute hospital staff to improve the care experience for people with dementia.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides an additional &euro;12.9 million for dementia services and supports and includes provision for the development and implementation of dementia care pathways in acute hospitals as well as for the implementation in all settings of the National Clinical Guideline on the appropriate prescribing of psychotropic medication for non-cognitive symptoms of dementia.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issues raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs, and that it will also provide transparency about service-allocation while ensuring that the scheme operates consistently and fairly across the country.</p><p>Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the on-going reform of Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care system, as envisaged in the <i>Sl&aacute;intecare Report</i>. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan commits to the establishment of the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services by the end of 2021. Work planned in 2020, including the planned testing of a reformed model of service delivery, was adversely affected due to the impact of COVID-19 on delivery mechanisms for home support and the requirement for the diversion of resources to deal with COVID-19.  This has had an impact on the final timeline. </p><p>The successful development of this scheme is an ambitious programme of reform and is a key priority for me, and the Minister for Health.  In order to accelerate this work, the Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that the required resourcing including personnel, governance structures and other requisite resources are scaled up to ensure that significant progress is achieved by the end of 2021.</p><p>Within this context funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll out of InterRAI as the standard assessment for care needs in the community, the testing of a reformed model of service delivery for home support services and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.  All of this work throughout 2021 will progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme. </p><p>In parallel, the increased investment in home support services in 2021 will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home care. </p></reply>

This Health Care Assistant (HCA) initiative began in April 2020 and ceased in August 2020 and was only ever intended as a temporary measure to provide additional support to the national effort in response to the initial impact of the Covid19 outbreak. </p>  <p>  The recently commissioned report by Professor Collins examined the possibility of re-opening the HCA initiative. I remain committed to keeping the HCA option available to the HSE, should the circumstances require it. My Department and the HSE are continuing to engage on what suitable resourcing supports the HSE may require. Since spring 2020, substantial financial resources have been provided to the HSE to recruit additional staff needed to support its work during this pandemic. The Department remains committed to providing these resources as required by the HSE into 2021. </p>  <p>  As part of the HSE's staffing requirements, should it seek a re-opening of the HCA initiative as suitable to its resourcing needs, my Department stand ready to assist.</p></reply>

The advice of NPHET is usually provided in the form of a letter to the Minister for Health from the Chief Medical Officer, in his role as the Chair of NPHET. This advice is subsequently published on the Government website. It has set out a consistent set of advices and recommendations that are available for inspection by all.</p>  <p>  The Government has always been clear that a &ldquo;zero Covid&rdquo; option is not one that is available to Ireland due to a number of factors, most pertinently the border with Northern Ireland and the Common Travel Area. Our proximity to Europe and the nature of the supply chains we are part of, both as an exporter and importer of vital goods, are also relevant in any considerations here.</p>  <p>  The clear advice from NPHET has been and continues to be that our overarching objective must be to suppress the virus to the lowest level possible and to maintain it at a low level. This is essential for protecting public health and our core priorities of education, health and social care services and shielding the most vulnerable from the disease.</p></reply>

However, there are concerns that the scale of Covid-related hospital (and ICU) admissions to date in the third wave, and those expected in the coming weeks, could impact cancer services. Staff absences due to Covid-19 continue to challenge capacity in cancer services.</p><p>The principles underpinning cancer care delivery during the pandemic are: </p><p>- continuation of diagnostic services, particularly patients referred to Rapid Access Clinics;  </p><p>- continuation of treatment, considering the risk: benefit ratio for each individual patient; </p><p>- prioritising time-sensitive treatment across the cancer pathway;  </p><p>- reviewing the location of the delivery of cancer services to optimise patient safety and infection control; </p><p>- minimising any non-essential face to face patient contact, e.g. through the use of virtual assessment and triage where appropriate; </p><p>- optimising the potential for providing cancer services in private hospitals; and </p><p>- adherence to national guidance for all services as laid out by NCCP and the HSE&rsquo;s Chief Clinical Officer.</p><p>My Department and the NCCP are working to ensure the continued provision of cancer services where safe and appropriate, engaging with hospital management and staff. GP referrals to cancer diagnostic services will continue to be accepted.  Medical and radiation oncology services continue.  Particular emphasis is being placed on ensuring that all time-dependent cancer surgeries are continued, much of them in private hospitals.  In that regard, focus will be maintained on the working of the Safety Net Services Agreements with private hospitals.  </p><p>The NCCP continues to provide information on Covid-19 for cancer patients and their families/carers through social media platforms and through individual cancer care teams.  Trends in numbers coming forward to diagnostic services, and the level of attendances for appointments for treatment, are being monitored closely.  Also, the public are encouraged to contact their GP if they have any potential signs or symptoms of cancer.</p></reply>

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that testing for Sars-Cov2 does not confirm that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. The HSE has worked intensively over the last number of months to put in place a comprehensive testing and tracing operation and despite the very significant increase in demand over the last number of weeks, the median time for community referral to appointment is now 0.2 days with 95.7% of GP referrals provided with a COVID-19 test appointment within 24 hours. </p>  <p>  While rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs) are described as rapid, and simple to perform, they are not designed to be delivered in large numbers. RADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, particularly where there is swabbing capacity on-site, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population. </p>  <p>  Validation studies, both here in Ireland and in Europe are showing significant disparities in sensitivity and specificity of tests versus manufacturer claims. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic patients is much better than in asymptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients, sensitivity results are being shown to be below the minimum performance requirements set by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team has endorsed recommendations on the use of Rapid Antigen Detection Tests (RADTs) as a supplement to PCR testing in certain situations, and particularly when the availability of PCR tests may be limited. The HSE is currently considering the use of RADTs for diagnosis of symptomatic persons and their close contacts in PCR confirmed outbreaks, and / or symptomatic persons where there is a high suspicion of an outbreak, pending PCR confirmation, if faster presumptive results will inform public health action. </p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

A fee of &euro;25 per vaccine dose, and a once-off &euro;10 per patient administration fee, will be payable to GPs and pharmacists for the administration of such vaccines outside of HSE-run mass-vaccination clinics, e.g. in GP practices and pharmacies. An hourly fee of &euro;120 and &euro;70 will be payable to GPs and pharmacists respectively for vaccination services provided in HSE-run mass-vaccination clinics.</p>  <p>  GPs and pharmacists are being asked to provide a proactive vaccination service which will require dedicated vaccination clinics while also maintaining regular services.  They are also being asked to undertake administrative functions with regard to patient identification and consent. As with other types of vaccinations, the fees reflect the amount of time required, administrative complexity, and the level of post-vaccination care likely required.</p>  <p>  The UK, which is a wholly publicly-funded health system, is not a very useful comparator for Ireland which has a blend of public and private GP-care provision.

The OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.  The Plan recognises that obesity is a complex, multi-faceted problem and needs a multi-pronged solution, with every sector of society playing its part.  The OPAP is based on the best available evidence in the Irish and international literature, and is informed by established international models and frameworks.  </p><p>The progress report on each recommendation of the OPAP has been completed and publication is expected in early February.</p><p>The evaluation of the OPAP being carried out by the Health Research Board Centre for Health and Diet Research is well advanced, but it has been delayed by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It will involve a partnership approach with a broad range of stakeholders, including government departments, the Health Service Executive, local government, local Community Development Organisations and voluntary groups.  There will be a particular emphasis on areas with the highest proportion of young families.  The initiative will leverage existing cross sectoral community-based assets and strengthen cross sectoral partnerships.</p>  <p>  Child obesity is a key priority under the cross-governmental Obesity Policy and Action Plan, as is reducing the inequalities seen in obesity rates.  It is clear that areas suffering socio-economic disadvantage suffer from higher overweight and obesity rates in all age groups, as well as worse outcomes under other health indicators such as physical activity and smoking.  The Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative Report round 5, published in October 2020, found that, while childhood obesity rates overall were stabilising, this was not the case in relation to socio-economically deprived areas.  The targeted approach of the Healthy Communities initiative aims to address the social determinants of health in a co-ordinated way in order to bring about improved health outcomes across a range of interrelated indicators, of which child obesity is an important element.  This will include leveraging and expanding existing programmes such as parenting programmes, Healthy Food Made Easy and Making Every Contact Count.  The initiative is still being developed in consultation with stakeholders, but it is intended that it will be implemented in a number of sites in 2021.</p></reply>

The extent of the involvement of Health Service Executive (HSE) personnel in the Scheme relates to making a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant meets the specified medical criteria for a Primary Medical Certificate, which is a requirement for the Scheme.  This determination is undertaken by Senior Medical Officers for the relevant HSE Community Health Organisation on behalf of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that following a Supreme Court decision of June 2020, the assessment process for Primary Medical Certificates was suspended at the request of the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe T.D..  Following the approval of the Finance Act 2020 which provides for the medical criteria in primary legislation,  the  Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, T.D., issued an instruction to the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE to the effect that Primary Medical Certificate assessments can recommence with effect from 1st January, 2021.</p><p>Separately, the ability to hold assessments may be impacted by, among other things, the public health restrictions in place and the role of the HSE Medical Officers in the roll out of the COVID vaccination programme.  I understand that the HSE is considering the matter of Primary Medical Certificate assessments in the context of their revision of the HSE recovery and restoration plans, taking into account the pressures and challenges to the health services presented by COVID.</p><p>As the specific case referenced by the Deputy is a service matter, I have arranged to have the correspondence referred to the HSE for consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of November 2020 there were 4,186 patients waiting compared to 6,378 in November 2018.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last year as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently recommending that only critical time dependent elective procedures are undertaken at this time due to the on-going and significant increased demand for bed capacity related to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions in January and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised concerning Nenagh Hospital and the number of procedures carried out in 2019 and 2020, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Following the reaching of agreement on a reform package dealing with a range of GP service and contractual issues, it was necessary to draft a formal and detailed agreement text which would form the basis on which implementation would be progressed and assessed. The HSE managed the preparation of the document text. This process took a number of weeks and a number of drafts were created and circulated between parties for review in this context, before the final text was agreed in all respects between the parties.</p>  <p>  Drafts 1 and 2 of the Agreement were circulated by the HSE to the negotiating parties on the 3rd  of April 2019, after the parties had reached agreement on all matters of substance.  On foot of those documents, additional consultations took place between the parties, and version 4 was circulated on 17 April.  My Department has found no records in relation to version 3, which was created by the HSE as a working version to track changes in the text.  The Department has found no records relating to the circulation of version 2 other than between the officials involved.</p></reply>

The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

These services contribute to positive ageing and better overall health.  Generally speaking, the HSE Funds approximately 28,000 Day Care places annually and approximately 10,000 people utilise these services annually.</p>  <p>  Day Care Centres across the country have predominantly been closed since March 2020 and as part of the focus and priority of the HSE to resume these services, a Guidance Document was prepared and circulated to HSE Operations Managers in July 2020 with the focus on opening up Day Care Centres in line within this framework. </p>  <p>  Services will resume when it is safe to do so; when all infection prevention and control measures and the requirements of physical distancing can be maintained, to protect service users and staff and prevent any further spread of the virus. Some Day Centres may not be suitable for reopening due to the constraints of their physical environment and it will be necessary to continue or expand alternative service delivery models.  A Focus Group consisting of key HSE and cross agency representation was established in November 2020 to ensure Day Care Services continue to be prioritised and to develop a plan that can assist service providers to have a suite of options available for the provision of Day Care/Supports throughout 2021. The Focus Group have met three times since its establishment with a view to developing a plan to support the current COVID-19 roadmap and provide guidance for services that can be provided under the various levels of the roadmap.  </p>  <p>  To ensure that day care clients are supported as effectively as possible the following supports are in place with services being prioritised for the most vulnerable clients and their carers:</p>  <p>  - Additional Home Support Packages or new Home Support Packages for the most vulnerable clients.</p>  <p>  - Meals on Wheels, Public Health Nursing, Chiropody, ongoing telephone contact.</p>  <p>  - Day Care in the Home for patients with Dementia &ndash; this is currently being successfully implemented by the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland.</p>  <p>  - Day Care in the Home &ndash; a model of Home Care in the Home is currently being finalised by the HSE National Dementia Office. This model is being reviewed by the Focus Group with a view to transferring it to regular Day Care Centres also. The model will continue to develop even when Day Care Centres re-open and will be based on needs assessment and what best benefits the client and their carers.</p></reply>

These facilities will provide high volume, low complexity procedures on a day and outpatient basis, together with a range of ambulatory diagnostic services. The high volume of demand for such services in these major urban centres is sufficient to justify the construction of dedicated ambulatory centres.&rdquo; </p><p>The introduction of these dedicated elective/ambulatory sites is also in line with the recommendations of the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review and the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy (August 2018). </p><p>In 2019 the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office (SPIO) established an Elective Hospitals Oversight Group, under the joint governance of the Health Service Executive, Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, to guide the development of the elective/ambulatory sites, as outlined in the <i>National Development Plan</i>(February 2018).</p><p>The Elective Hospitals Oversight Group has the following terms of reference:  </p><p>1. To develop the elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need, which facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care. </p><p>2. To provide quicker, higher quality, safer care for selected, elective patients.</p><p>3. To create capacity for acute hospital sites and reduce/eliminate outlier boarding (trolleys).</p><p>4. To drive down waiting lists, both outpatient and inpatient/day case.</p><p>5. To reduce cancellations.</p><p>6. To reduce acute hospital footfall.  </p><p>The Oversight Group is following the process outlined in the Public Spending Code. As required under the Code, a Strategic Assessment Report has been drafted for the development of Elective Hospital facilities. This sets out the rationale for investment, the alignment of the programme with strategic requirements of Government, some initial options and potential costs, and the governance of the programme. This document is complete and is currently going through the approval channels. </p><p>A high-level facilities spatial brief, including costs, a functional description and process flow, a site options appraisal and a Preliminary Business Case (PBC) in accordance with the public spending code has been drafted. The site option appraisal was carried out to explore indicative sites and was not a site selection process. </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension, and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three-year cap. No participant will pay more than the actual cost of care.</p><p>Under the NHSS, rental income is considered income for the purpose of the financial assessment, and is assessed at 80% less any allowable deductions. </p><p>The programme for government, Our Shared Future, commits to reforming the Fair Deal scheme to incentivise renting out vacant properties. The Department of Health is currently engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in this regard. There are significant complexities in any changes to the NHSS, particularly to ensure the ongoing fair, equitable and sustainable operation of the scheme, so all competing interests and relevant issues must be fully considered.</p></reply>

The review will provide an opportunity to reflect on progress in implementing the strategy from 2017 to 2020, and to consider the development of new actions to address emerging needs and challenges. </p><p>The results of the review will determine whether further actions need to be developed for the period 2021-2025. </p><p>I believe the national drugs strategy is a living document, that should be adjusted to take account of new insights and understandings about the needs of people who use drugs or have alcohol dependency, in particular arising Covid-19. It also should reflect the important commitments in the Programme for Government. I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders on the review and to reinvigorating the partnership approach that underpins the national drugs strategy.  </p></reply>

Action 6.1.50 of the strategy commits to ensuring that Task Forces have proper arrangements in place for the selection and renewal of the Chair, Members of Task Forces and for having proper procedures in place for addressing conflicts of interest.</p>  <p>  The Department set up a working group to revise the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces Handbook in line with Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery. One of the outputs of the group will be a new code of governance for task forces in line with best practice in the community, voluntary and charitable sectors.</p>  <p>  Adherence to the code will require a new regime of governance and documentation for task forces. It is anticipated that task forces will be required to sign up to the Charities Regulator governance code, The code sets minimum standards for the board of a registered charity or limited company to ensure they effectively manage and control their organisations.</p>  <p>  The Department will support the implementation of this code of governance. This is an important step in strengthening the performance of task forces.</p>  <p>  Work to complete the code of governance for task forces has been delayed due to resource constraints. The Department hopes to finish this project in early 2021.</p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the network of drug and alcohol task forces to develop targeted drug and alcohol initiatives that deliver the actions of the national drugs strategy. I provided an additional &euro;1 million in Budget 2021 for this purpose. </p></reply>

This unprecedented additional amount of money signals our determination in government to fund an expansion of, and improvements in, our health and social care services. The main areas of focus for the unprecedented allocation in Budget 2021 is on delivering the capacity shortfalls, particularly in Acute Hospital services, which were highlighted by the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review, supporting the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare by moving care provision to community settings where appropriate, making strategic investments to progress a range of long term health strategies and responding to the immediate service pressures and challenges which have been caused by COVID-19. Included in the 2021 estimate for the Health vote &euro;1.676 million to deal with the impacts of Covid-19. </p><p>The table below summarises Department and State Agencies 2021 COVID-19 planned Budget spend: <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Department/State Agency </div></th>       <th><div>&euro; million </div></th>       <th><div>Budgetary Analysis </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Health </td>       <td>1,676 </td>       <td>This is made up as follows: PPE &euro;450, Testing and Tracing &euro;445m, Vaccination Programme &euro;200m, Covid Specific Supports and other Supports &euro;581 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MENTAL HEALTH COMMISSION</td>       <td>0.65 </td>       <td>This is made up of: Developing for video conferencing to enable remote mental health tribunal (450k) and &euro;200k for agency staff to continue the Covid monitoring of all mental health facilities during 2021 at the request of the Department.  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>HEALTH INFORMATION AND QUALITY AUTHORITY</td>       <td>.0042 </td>       <td>This is made up of: &euro;42k on PPE to deal with the impact of COVID-19 on our day-to-day operations in 2021.<br /><br /></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In terms of Budgetary analysis carried out to plan for long Covid-19 impacts the following analysis and planning activities are being undertaken:</p><p>Recognising the unprecedented uncertainty faced by policy-makers in planning for the progression of COVID-19, a PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) Estimation Model has been developed to provide for a transparent, dynamic, evidence-based estimate of required PPE for the Irish healthcare system. </p><p>Also, in the coming year, a robust and comprehensive Testing and Tracing system will be critical to the effective functioning of our health services and the broader economy. Testing and contact tracing continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic, and to ensure we have a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation, central to our public health strategy for containing and slowing the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>The COVID-19 Vaccination Programme is unprecedented in terms of the complexity, scale, scope of work and resource required to deliver it effectively in the expected timeframe. Successfully implementing this National Vaccination Programme for COVID-19 is critical to (1) contain, over time, the spread of the virus, (2) mitigate its health impact by protecting the at-risk population and (3) restore economic growth by allowing a return to normal economic and social activity. </p><p>However, it should be recognised that there remains considerable uncertainty concerning the timing of vaccine delivery in 2021 as the environment is extremely dynamic. It would be expected that the progressive rollout of the COVID vaccination programme will in due course impact on the budgetary requirement for other COVID-19 responses such as PPE purchasing and Testing and Tracing, but the timing of such savings impacts is not yet clear. As a result, we will keep the budgetary allocation for specific COVID-19 programmes under ongoing review within overall allocation that I have noted of &euro;1.676bn as the picture becomes more clear over the coming months.</p><p>Finally, Deputies will, like me, be very mindful of the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the population. As part of the Department&rsquo;s joint research programme in healthcare reform with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), recently published research provides projections of expenditure for public acute hospital and adult acute psychiatric in-patient services in Ireland for the years 2018&ndash;2035. These projections are based on new ESRI projections for population and economic growth, both of which consider the impact of COVID-19. A range of alternative projections are presented reflecting alternative assumptions about population growth, trends in health and life expectancy, policy change, and costs. The report contains the most comprehensive mapping of Irish public hospital expenditure to have been published.</p></reply>

The European Commission has advised that, in line with the regulatory provisions governing the operation of the scheme, an applicant may only benefit once under the Basic Payment Scheme National Reserve.  As these EU Regulations apply to all Member States, Ireland has no discretion with regard to their implementation.</p>  <p>  In order to be considered eligible under the young farmer category of the National Reserve, the applicant must be setting up as the head of holding for the first time or have set up such a holding during the five years preceding the first submission of the Basic Payment Scheme application.  In the example provided, the date of commencement of the first young farmer is deemed to be the date of setting up of the holding for the purpose of eligibility under the National Reserve, and it was on this basis the National Reserve allocation was made.</p>  <p>  Where a young farmer sibling subsequently joins the herd number, this holding is still regarded as having set up for the first time based on the date the first young farmer joined the herd number.  The addition of the sibling to the herd number in such a situation would not meet the criteria of setting up for the first time and the second young farmer joining the herd number can not make the entity eligible for a second National Reserve allocation.  As this holding has already received a benefit from the National Reserve, it not eligible for a further allocation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-27a.2475.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012700102#WRUU01600"><p>Since my appointment on 2nd September 2020, I have held many detailed and informative virtual meetings with representatives of the Irish fishing industry from the catching, processing and inshore sectors from the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation (KFO), the Irish South and West Fish Producers&rsquo; Organisation (ISWFPO), the Irish South and East Fish Producers' Organisation (ISEFPO), the Irish Fish Producers&rsquo; Organisation (IFPO), the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) and the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association (IFPEA). </p>  <p>  I held specific fisheries meetings on 16 September, 12 October (with An Taoiseach and Minister Coveney) and 9 December 2020 (with Minister Coveney), to brief industry on the state of play with regard to the Future Agreement negotiations, to hear their concerns and discuss the challenges facing the Irish fishing industry once the UK left the EU and the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>  <p>  On 26 November 2020, I chaired a virtual meeting of the Sea Fisheries Liaison Group attended by fishing industry representatives from the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation (KFO), the Irish South and West Fish Producers&rsquo; Organisation (ISWFPO), the Irish South and East Fish Producers&rsquo; Organisation (ISEFPO), the Irish Fish Producers&rsquo; Organisation (IFPO) and the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association (IFPEA) as well as environmental NGOs.  This meeting is held each year in advance of the negotiations at the December EU Fisheries Council so that the Minister can hear the views of all fisheries stakeholders on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas for the following year.  I was very pleased with the good engagement at the meeting.  The input from stakeholders is an important part of the Sustainability Impact Assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, which also includes a public consultation and as well as expert contributions from the Marine Institute (MI) and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM).</p>  <p>  On 9 December 2020, I met by VC with the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation (KFO), the Irish South and West Fish Producers&rsquo; Organisation (ISWFPO), the Irish South and East Fish Producers&rsquo; Organisation (ISEFPO), the Irish Fish Producers&rsquo; Organisation (IFPO) and the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) to update industry on the preparations for the December Council.  As the negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK were still ongoing at the time, interim arrangements were needed to ensure continuity of fishing in the early part of 2021.  The Commission had therefore proposed to set provisional TACs for the first three months of the year.  I set out Ireland&rsquo;s goals for the upcoming negotiations including seeking  higher provisional TACs for seasonal stocks such as Mackerel, Horse Mackerel and Blue Whiting.  </p>  <p>Also on 9th December 2020, I hosted a meeting of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) where the NIFF delivered presentations on the challenges small scale coastal fishers have faced in accessing financial supports and on opportunities the sector would like to maximise into the future. The NIFF also highlighted the worries the Covid-19 pandemic has brought from finances, to health and social inclusion. I encouraged the inshore sector to feed into the development of the Operational Programme for the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund 2021-2027. I also commended the NIFF for giving voice to the stress many have felt since the start of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  I also held two virtual meetings with fishing industry representative groups over the course of December Council (on 15 and 16 December) to update them on the progress of the negotiations and a further virtual meeting on 17 December to update on the outcome of Council.</p>  <p>  Following the reaching of an Agreement on EU-UK Trade and Cooperation, on 28th December, I (together with An Taoiseach and Minister Coveney) met again with representatives of the Irish fishing industry. I reassured them that I fully understood their concerns regarding a cut in a number of quota shares. I also assured representatives that we will work together with the sector to develop the necessary supports and approach to address these impacts.</p>  <p>  I also convened several Consultative Committee meetings of all Departmental stakeholders on 16 September, 21 October and 21 December 2020 to allow for a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceeded and to provide updates on the practical implications of the ending of the transition period. Fishing industry representatives were invited to attend these meetings, along with other agri-food stakeholders, and had the opportunity to make interventions. The most recent Consultative Committee meeting took place last week, on  20 January. Fisheries matters were discussed during the course of this meeting.</p>  <p>  Opportunities to meet with the fishing industry representatives are always welcome and I look forward to continuing my close cooperation with the fishing sector.</p></reply>

In 2020, my Department published new national Recognition Criteria under the CMO to be satisfied by applicants for recognition.  In line with the commitments in our Programme for Government to facilitate formation of Producer Organisations in the inshore fisheries sector, the new Recognition Criteria were introduced to make it easier for inshore fisheries producer groups to achieve recognition as a PO.  Producer Organisation status has many advantages, including better negotiating strength in the market for producers, financial supports under my Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme and certain protections under EU competition law.</p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department received two applications from inshore fisheries producer groups, one of which was from the National Inshore Fishermen's Association CLG.  The CMO Regulation provides for a time frame of three months within which to determine an application for recognition, subject to receipt of all necessary information.  On 15 July 2020, my Department wrote to the NIFA requesting additional information to assist in consideration of their application.  The NIFA responded on some of the issues concerned, but a response is awaited on some others.  These relate to organisational and procedural matters, such as the constitution of the NIFA.  Pending receipt of that information, consideration of the application from the NIFA is paused.  My officials have discussed the status of the application with the NIFA on a number of occasions, but remain available to provide any additional guidance needed by the NIFA.</p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government commitments, I also introduced new financial supports in 2020 under my Department&rsquo;s EMFF Programme, making available to producer groups seeking recognition grants for IT equipment, office furniture, legal, accountancy and other relevant professional advice, website development costs and costs of room hire etc.</p></reply>

In this regard my Department provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations. These supports include provision of a free disease diagnostic service for Irish beekeepers to help maintain the health of the bee population, funding to carry out applied research through the National Apiculture Programme, grants to national beekeeping associations and also grant aid to fund capital investments for beekeepers. </p>  <p>  American Foul Brood Disease (AFB) and European Foul Brood Disease (EFB) are notifiable diseases of bees and are regulated by EU and national legislation. To ensure compliance with legislation and to support bee health, beekeepers are required to contact my Department and submit samples if any one of above mentioned notifiable diseases is suspected or diagnosed. AFB and EFB occur in Irish honey bee colonies and information on theses diseases and sampling process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. Samples can be submitted through the free disease diagnostic service. If a sample tests positive officials from my Department will contact the beekeeper directly to outline the appropriate steps to be taken. </p>  <p>  In relation to the importation of honeybees into Ireland, this is allowed under regulations governing intra-Community trade with other EU Member States. The specific health requirements for trading in bees are laid out in Council Directive 92/65/EEC. All imports of bees must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the country of export. The reason for this is to ensure that imported bees are healthy and do not harbour pathogens or parasites that may be harmful to our native bee stocks. </p>  <p>  The importation of bees is therefore subject to EU regulation on intra community trade.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is a legal requirement under Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 of the European Parliament and Council laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin, for all beekeepers producing honey to register with my Department. This register is used to conduct the annual honey hygiene inspection programme.</p></reply>

Under the new designations, Ros a Mh&iacute;l and Howth will be able to accommodate landings of demersal stocks from vessels under 26 metres and will operate Monday to Friday from 10am to 10pm.  Greencastle, Rathmullen and Burtonport will be designated for non-quota species landings from vessels under 18 metres and will operate from 2pm to 8pm from Monday to Friday.  </p>  <p>  There are significant practical and cost implications for the State in the designation of EU ports for Third Country landings as, under EU Regulations, such designations represent an entry point to the European Union following which food is free to circulate within the full EU common market.  On this basis for any ports designated,  Ireland is obliged to ensure that it has in place a  meaningful control presence. I have requested the SFPA to review the costs and resource demands arising in the event of  further designations. </p>  <p>  In 2018, there were 15 landings of UK vessels into Dunmore East.  This was reduced to 9 landings in 2019.  Over these two years, only 318 tonnes of fish were landed into this port by UK vessels.

Every application received is treated on its own merits and considered on its own and in combination with other plans and projects near to the application site.  The proposed operations are carefully assessed for their potential impact on the surrounding countryside and environment.  All applications for forestry licences across the various categories are equally important although by far the greatest number of licences received are for felling.</p><p>By way of illustration, in 2020 over 3,200 new licence applications were received.  These are broken down into approx. 25% for afforestation, 20% for forest roads and 55% for tree felling.  Over 2,500 application decisions were issued last year with approx. 20% for afforestation, 13% forest roads and 66% tree felling.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of a backlog of almost 2,000 forestry licences that have been referred to  ecology.Files that are not referred to ecology are dealt with as they arise. For those files that are referred to ecology, a project plan is in place.  Part of this plan is to give priority to those applicants who provide a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) to support their application.  An applicant may, at their own expense, submit an NIS prepared by a suitably qualified person and this can reduce the waiting time for a decision to two to three months.</p><p>I am committed to increasing the level of output of all licences and would point out that in order to do so we have invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added in 2021.

Having said that, my Department issued licences for 4,342ha of afforestation in 2020 and 2,433ha of new afforestation was planted.  </p>  <p>  Afforestation licences have a three-year validity and my Department estimates a total of 4,900ha is currently available for planting with a valid afforestation licence and not subject to appeal.  I would encourage licence holders to plant afforestation and to benefit from the grants and generous annual premiums that are available.  At present, my Department has 1,009 afforestation applications on hand for 4,500ha approx. and there are a further 90 awaiting a decision by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) in respect of approx 1,100ha. </p>  <p>  It is my immediate priority to increase the number of licences issued.  You will be aware of the delays caused by changes to the licensing system which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input in order to comply with environmental requirements. We are tackling these delays by means of a systematic project plan. We have invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added in 2021. This has already resulted in an increase in the number of licences issued, and the last quarter of 2020 saw the highest number of licences issued last year. </p>  <p>  The aim is to sustain and build substantially on that output and ensure the consistent high level of output that those who wish to plant need.  </p>  <p>  We have also implemented changes to the functioning of the FAC and acted quickly to propose and implement the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I have significantly resourced the FAC and four appeals committees are now set up and hearing appeals. The FAC is now hearing an average of 60 licences per month representing an increase of 150%.  This increase in output will give confidence to applicants and appellants alike.  The FAC in consultation with the Agriculture Appeals Office is currently reviewing ways in which greater efficiency can be achieved across the four divisions of the FAC.   </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.</p></reply>

My Department worked closely with all stakeholders, other Government Departments and agencies and other European Union (EU) Member States to ensure that the best possible deal between the EU and the United Kingdom (UK) could be obtained.  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA)  is very welcome in that it established a trading relationship based on zero tariffs and quota restrictions, and avoided what would have been very damaging tariffs in the event of &lsquo;No Deal&rsquo;. </p><p>However, even with the TCA in place, the reality is that the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, the Single Market and the Customs Union means that operators must engage with a range of customs procedures and regulatory checks and controls on their trade with the UK that did not apply before 1<sup>st</sup>January. </p><p>There are more than 16,000 thoroughbred journeys per year between Ireland and GB, including movements to races, sales or for breeding. More than 5,000 of those movements are between Ireland and Continental Europe, using the GB land bridge. Brexit means that EU import rules apply to the entry of horses from Great Britain in the same way as they apply to imports of horses from other third countries. My Department has engaged regularly with stakeholders for the past number of years to ensure they are informed of the potential impact of Brexit on the equine industry, including issuing a number of guidance notes, and arranging a joint webinar together with the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in December specifically on the issue of equine movement.  </p><p>My Department has also concluded successor agreements (&ldquo;Bipartite Agreements&rdquo;) to the Tripartite Agreement, with Northern Ireland and with France. Because the UK is a non-EU country, it is not legally possible to extend the Tripartite Agreement to Great Britain. </p><p>My Department will continue to engage with stakeholders on the challenges of Brexit. In conjunction with other branches of Government, my Department will continue to ensure that the necessary controls are conducted in a manner that ensures the minimum possible disruption to trade flows but also meets Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory requirements as an EU Member State. </p></reply>

BEAM was funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support.  Since 2019, 33,445 farmers have received some &euro;77.72M as part of the scheme,  &euro;50 million of which was funded by the EU. </p><p>It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall in light of the COVID-19 market disturbance.  </p><p>One of the conditions under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the EU was that there had to be an element of reduction or re-structuring built in to the scheme.

This reduction could only be recorded against individual herds that signed up for the programme.</p><p>Obligations under the measure were developed based on analysis of the herd profile and nitrates profile of the national herd.  It was designed, in consultation with farmer representative organisations, to make the measure as easy to participate in as possible, whilst maintaining the requirement under the implementing regulation for temporary market adjustments.  </p><p>My Department continues to develop and put in place supports for farmers to assist them in managing their commitments under the Scheme and further initiatives will be rolled out in the coming weeks in that regard.  An online BEAM calculator is being developed which will not only inform participants as to how much of their target figure they have used but allow them to predict what effect prospective changes to their herd will have on their figures in the run up to the deadline.</p><p>Existing data provided shows participants the totals for organic bovine nitrogen produced on their holding for twelve month periods. These figures are updated monthly as soon as the data is available. Nitrates data is compiled from extracted information from my Department&rsquo;s AIM system which is constantly being updated. Due to the nature of these updates and allowing for the intervals between events such as calving or movements taking place and being subsequently reported, there is a 5 week interval before the Nitrates data is extracted.  This is to allow the data to settle and ensure accuracy as regulatory timeframes such as the 27 day registration rule for calves are provided for. The existing data is accurate to the end of November and the data up to 31<sup>st</sup>December will be available in the coming weeks.  My officials will be writing to participating farmers again shortly to provide further information in assisting them in managing their commitments under BEAM.</p><p>Based on the most recent data, some 14,000 participating farmers are currently meeting the 5% reduction requirement.  </p></reply>

The necessary steps have been taken to ensure that producers and processors can continue to operate effectively and keep supply lines open and that the Department and agencies can operate as effectively as possible.</p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine and including the agri-food State Agencies, met five times in 2020, and Covid has been a standing item on the agenda. The cross-Government response; the continuity of services to the sector; specific supports; and the potential long-term impacts for the sector are discussed. A variety of supports to assist the sector been implemented including a scheme of aids to private storage under the CAP for certain dairy products, &euro;50 million for beef finishing farms and a Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme for fishing vessels. </p>  <p>  Many of the horizontal supports available to individuals and businesses are also available to the agri-food sector, including the Covid-19 Working Capital Loan Scheme and the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS), both of which are supported by my Department.</p>  <p>  The agri-food sector faced many challenges on the domestic and international front last year arising from the economic impacts of the pandemic. Despite this, the sector has proven to be very resilient. Production has been relatively unaffected. After an initial decrease in farm gate prices, they have stabilised and recovered across most sectors.</p>  <p>  Agri-food exports for 2020 are estimated at &euro;14.3 billion, down marginally from &euro;14.5 billion in 2019. This is a remarkable achievement considering the challenges food and drink producers have faced, including the complete shutdown of food services in many of Ireland&rsquo;s export markets across the globe.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government prioritised management of the Covid crisis and Brexit. My Department and its agencies, in consultation with stakeholders, will continue to monitor the impacts on the agri-food sector as the situation evolves, and will continue to provide appropriate supports to the sector, as it has done throughout the pandemic to date.</p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are monitoring the impact of the pandemic on their own budgets in light of changes to expenditure in areas such as travel and subsistence that manifested in 2020 and which are likely to continue in 2021.  The increased use of remote working and video conferencing technology platforms are likely to deliver savings and benefits on a longer term basis.  However, there may also be additional costs associated with these ways of working that will have to be factored into the plans for the operation of future Remote Working policies.  My Department is working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments to contribute to a framework to support the implementation of these working arrangements for the civil service in the future.</p></reply>

The National Remote Work Strategy, which was published recently by the Government, acknowledges the lack of data currently available on remote working and commits to developing data on the incidence and frequency of remote work in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Separately, a Working Group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department was established last October to oversee the development of a National Hub Network.  The first phase of this Group&rsquo;s work is to identify, map, survey and classify the various remote working facilities throughout the country.  This exercise will also help to identify those hubs that have received State funding.</p>  <p>  This work, which is currently under way, will lead to the establishment of an integrated network of remote working facilities with shared back-office services, and will provide a significant knowledge asset that can inform future investment in remote working facilities. I expect to be in a position to outline the results of this work over the course of the year. </p>  <p>  A number of Government Departments and agencies have provided investment for the development of remote working facilities over the last number of year.  My own Department has invested over &euro;50 million in these facilities since 2016 through the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. </p>  <p>  A further &euro;5 million has been allocated to the Town and Village Renewal Scheme this year to support the development of remote working infrastructure throughout the country.

This is a direct response to the increase demand and need for remote working capability for all citizens. Given the remit of the Department I do not expect the impacts of long Covid-19 to be significant in terms of the work of my Department and its agencies, however, all significant developments with regard to this pandemic will continue to feed into future decisions on utilization of resources. </p></reply>
