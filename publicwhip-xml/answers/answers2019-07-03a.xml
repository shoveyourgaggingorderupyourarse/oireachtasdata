There was a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices lasting from autumn 2018 to spring 2019, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission.</p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. Building on this is the exchequer-funded Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million pilot project for 2019. </p>  <p>   My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP, and through the next Agri Food strategy to 2030.  This includes opening new opportunities for the sale of Irish beef on international markets and, in recent years, Irish beef has gained access to the US, Japanese, Chinese and other markets.  I have also provided additional resources to Bord Bia to promote beef in new and more traditional markets.</p>  <p>  My view is that such measures should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-03a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070300075#WRA01100"><p>The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is  a constant and central component of the strategic development of the industry, as evidenced by its placement at the heart of Food Wise 2025. It is particularly important given the need to diversify our markets and reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.   </p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of EU-agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada, Japan and Mexico, my Department continues its efforts to open new markets while further deepening trade with existing markets for Irish agri-food exporters. </p>  <p>  For example, in 2018, it facilitated the decision of the Chinese authorities to open their market to Irish beef imports by listing a number of approved Irish beef establishments. Other notable achievements during 2018 were agreements with Qatar and Kuwait, which allowed for the importation of Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry to their markets. </p>  <p>  In April 2019, we saw the opening of the Ukrainian market for Irish beef and pork. During my June trade mission to Japan, an agreement was reached in principle to allow access for Irish Sheepmeat. This development followed the announcement last month of the removal of the under-30 months restriction for Irish beef exports to Japan. This means that all Irish beef is now eligible for export to this very valuable market.</p>  <p>  Trade Missions play an important role in this work.  In 2018, I led successful missions to the US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia, and an extensive trade mission itinerary is also being pursued in 2019. In March, Turkey was visited, primarily focusing on Live Trade. In May, I visited China. This was quickly followed with an extensive mission to Japan and South Korea in June. My next scheduled mission is to Algeria and Egypt in November.   </p>  <p>  Overall, agri-food exports to countries outside the EU have increased from around &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;3.6 billion in the period 2014 to 2018. This represents very rapid growth of 36% in that four-year timeframe.</p></reply>

Not alone are our sustainability ambitions driven by regulatory compliance but also by market demand with today's consumer seeking confirmation of our sustainability credentials.</p>  <p>  To achieve the challenging target for the sector as set out in this plan will require immediate action through early adoption and high levels of take-up of the actions identified across our 139,00 plus family farms.</p>  <p>  I see three important actions that can be advanced immediately.</p>  <p>  - Deepening engagement with farmers and other stakeholders along the food supply chain to promote the necessary deployment of new technologies and improvement in farming practices; </p>  <p>  - Improving nitrogen use efficiency such as widespread adoption of low emissions slurry spreading,  introduction of clover in grassland swards and more efficient use of fertilisers; and</p>  <p>  - Continuing our support for research and innovation such as animal breeding, improved grassland and fertiliser management and examining the potential of novel feed additives in grass based production systems. </p>  <p>  Ongoing negotiations on the future of the next Common Agricultural Policy will ensure that our ambition in this area is aligned with European and national policy while also recognising the importance of a sustainable and viable agricultural sector to rural communities.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government to ensure successful implementation of the plan. I am also confident that the agriculture sector as a whole will contribute significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and society with collaboration, co-operation and collective responsibility being key in achieving this ambition and realising the potential of pro-active engagement.</p></reply>

Up to 14 June 2019, 585 applications have been approved.  The total number of loans progressed to sanction at bank level is 141, with a total value of &euro;30.6m, of which 29, with a value of &euro;8.2m, relate to food businesses;  </p><p>-a market prioritisation exercise undertaken by Bord Bia to identify priority markets across all food and drinks categories; </p><p>-tailored supports and analysis are being provided to food companies through Bord Bia&rsquo;s Brexit Barometer;</p><p>- an intensified series of trade missions to develop and grow new markets;</p><p>- the recently launched DBEI/DAFM &ldquo;Future Growth Loan Scheme&rdquo; will bring up to &euro;300 million of long-term strategic investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors.  The fund is leveraged by Exchequer funding of &euro;62 million, of which 40%, or some &euro;25 million, has been provided by my Department.  Businesses have been able to apply for loan eligibility through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) since 17th April 2019. </p><p>I also have had ongoing discussions with Commissioner Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit. The Commission have already made &euro;50m available to Irish beef farmers as a response to market pressures, and this can be matched by national funding. I expect to be rolling out a support scheme with this funding in the very near future.  I have also stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a further range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agri-food and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p><p>And, of course, our practical preparations for all potential scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit, continue to be progressed and refined through the whole-of-Government coordination structures that have been in place for some time.</p></reply>

However, while agriculture is contributing to emissions, it is also part of the solution. The Teagasc Sustainability Survey shows that the top performing third of farms emitted, on average, 9.6 kg CO2 equivalent per kg beef, compared with 14.9 kg for the bottom performing third of cattle farms. Reducing this variability is a real opportunity to make progress in reducing emissions from cattle production in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Innovations unique to Ireland such as the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), the Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme, the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) and initiatives such as Origin Green, Quality Assurance schemes and Knowledge Transfer Schemes all contribute to lowering the carbon footprint of the sector.</p>  <p>  The All-of-Government Plan to tackle climate breakdown identifies 34 actions for the agriculture, forestry and land-use sector that will contribute to our transition to a low carbon economy and society. These include abatement measures, carbon sequestration measures and measures to displace fossil fuels.

It will first go through a process of legal scrubbing, which could take up to two years, before being put before the European Trade Council for ratification by Qualified Majority Vote, and the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  If the agreement passes those hurdles, it is expected that the trade elements which fall under the EU Commission's competence, will be phased in over 6 years.</p></reply>

This reflects our three pillar policy approach to achieving carbon neutrality without comprising sustainable food production </p>  <p>  These actions in this all-of-government plan are informed by the recent Teagasc Marginal Cost Abatement Curve report (MACC) - An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030. The Teagasc MACC curve provides an identifiable suite of actions for delivery including both efficiency measures such as the Dairy EBI programme and technical measures such as changes in fertiliser type or low emissions slurry spreading as well as a series of forestry and bioeceonomy measures.</p>  <p>  To achieve the challenging target for the sector as set out in the All-of-Government Plan will require immediate action and will require early adoption and high levels of take-up of the actions identified across our 139,00 plus family farms.</p>  <p>   I see three important actions that can be advanced immediately.</p>  <p>  - Deepening engagement with farmers and other stakeholders to promote the necessary deployment of new technologies and changes in farming practices; </p>  <p>  - Improving nitrogen use efficiency such as increasing adoption of low emissions slurry spreading, introduction of clover in grassland swards and improving fertiliser efficiency; and</p>  <p>  - Continuing our support for research and innovation such as advancing grassland and fertiliser management techniques and examining the potential of novel feed additives in grass based production systems. </p>  <p>  I will work to ensure that the next Common Agriculture Policy is aligned with this ambition and that climate action is mainstreamed in the development of our CAP strategic plan to ensure the delivery of this target. Furthermore that enhancements to CAP performance are complimented by market based incentives and regulation where necessary.</p>  <p>  Ireland has an opportunity to become a global leader in actions on climate change. If we succeed in our ambition in this area we will create a progressive and sustainable society that is not only economically successful but also offers an enhanced quality of lifestyle to society as a whole.</p></reply>

The complex proposals involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental ambition of the CAP.  </p>  <p>  Since their launch, intensive discussions have taken place on the proposals.  A significant number of Working Group meetings have been held under both the Austrian and Romanian Presidencies.  The proposals have also been discussed extensively at the Special Committee for Agriculture meetings and have been a standing agenda item at every Council of EU Agriculture Ministers meeting. </p>  <p>  At the conclusion of the Romanian Presidency's term at the helm, it is clear that good progress has been made, but decisions on many key issues, such as the provisions for Direct Payments and the New Delivery Model, have still to be agreed upon at EU level. The Finnish Presidency has outlined an intensive programme of Working Party meetings to discuss specific aspects of the new CAP proposals for the duration of its Presidency, which begins now.  </p>  <p>  Before the new proposals can be implemented, it will be necessary to reach overall agreement within the Council and then together with the European Parliament and Commission.  The new Parliament has yet to reach a position in plenary on the proposals.  The on-going negotiation on the Multi-annual Financial Framework, which includes the CAP budget, is another key issue that must be resolved. </p>  <p>  I will continue to seek to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agri-food sector.</p></reply>

The seabed beneath the EEZ is the continental shelf.</p>  <p>  Largely due to efforts made by Ireland throughout the 1970s, international law is now clear that uninhabitable rocks such as Rockall have no entitlement to a continental shelf or an EEZ and so, sovereignty over such a rock is irrelevant for the purposes of establishing boundaries between continental shelves and EEZs of neighbouring States.  Sovereignty, and whether such a rock has a 12-mile territorial sea, are separate issues that do not arise in establishing boundaries between continental shelves and EEZs.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Agreement built on the 1988 Agreement between Ireland and the UK that had already established continental shelf boundaries and provides that those boundaries, slightly adjusted to ensure that no waters were lost to the high seas, shall also be the EEZ boundaries.  This created a single maritime boundary between 12 and 200 miles in the water and on the seabed beneath.   </p>  <p>  As you are aware, Ireland has never made any claims to Rockall nor have we recognised British claims to sovereignty over it.  Nothing in either Agreement altered that position or represented a departure from our long held view, nor does either Agreement have any implications for the present difficulties between Ireland and Scotland over fishing rights around Rockall.</p>  <p>  As regards the situation following Brexit, the Irish and EU position, as set out in the March 2018 European Council Guidelines for negotiations on the future relationship, is that existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources should be maintained.   </p>  <p>  The main purpose of the 2013 Agreement was to resolve jurisdictional uncertainty.  It addressed the situation of fishing vessels seeking to avoid inspection in Irish EEZ areas that overlapped with the UK-claimed areas.  The issue of Rockall did not arise in the 2013 Agreement as it was not relevant.  Importantly, however, it also provides the legal certainty necessary for raising finance to develop renewable energy projects in the areas concerned and it resolved confusion over responsibility for dealing with marine pollution incidents in those areas.</p></reply>

All allegations will be examined to determine the appropriate actions.</p><p>Bord na gCon, in addition to its focus on the core business of greyhound racing, places a strong emphasis on regulation of the industry and the welfare of greyhounds. It is evident that the successful growth and sustainability of the industry is heavily dependent on public confidence in the integrity of racing.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Greyhound Sector has undergone a series of reforms in recent times and the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 was signed by the President on the 28<sup>th</sup>May 2019. The drafting of this legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability. </p><p>Bord na gCon only encourages and promotes the export of greyhounds to countries that have established a positive animal welfare code and practices. My Department understands that Bord na gCon is currently updating its Code of Practice in the Care and Welfare of the Greyhound to include provisions on best practice when exporting greyhounds, including advice to the exporter on the need to research the proposed export destination in relation to its animal welfare standards and legislation.</p><p>In recent days, Bord na gCon has also announced a series of measures that will be implemented: </p><p>- The introduction of a greyhound injury support scheme to provide financial assistance to aid injured greyhounds to continue with a healthy life.</p><p>- Extending and increasing support for foster care of greyhounds to identify new foster homes within Ireland for greyhounds.</p><p>- Revision, in conjunction with the International Greyhound Welfare Forum, of the Code of Practice on the Care and Welfare of the Greyhound to address retirement and transportation of greyhounds.</p><p>- Financially incentivise the rehoming of greyhounds in Ireland through the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust (which assisted in the rehoming of 1,021 greyhounds last year).</p><p>- Intensify the inspection regime of greyhound establishments (491 inspections were undertaken in 2018).</p><p>- Preparation of a statutory instrument to make it a legal requirement that euthanasia of a greyhound must be carried out by a veterinary practitioner. (This is already the standard expected under the IGB Code of Practice for the Care and Welfare of the Greyhound).</p><p>- Provision of the Code of Practice to all registered greyhound owners </p><p>- Progress the traceability provisions of the Greyhound Act 2019 </p><p>- Establish a confidential Freephone line to enable reports of welfare breaches to be reported to the IGB for investigation by relevant agencies.</p><p>Minister Doyle will be meeting with the Board of Bord na gCon this week to discuss these and any other measures that may be required to bring about comprehensive changes in the sector. For these reasons, an action plan for the industry will be carefully considered and announced by my Department in due course.</p><p>My Department is not in a position to know whether dogs, including greyhounds, that are moved from Ireland to another EU Member State are subsequently exported to a further country. The export of dogs from other member states is a matter for the authorities in those member states. </p><p>In relation to coursing, under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, the regulation of coursing is chiefly a matter for the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon. Hares can only be collected for coursing by clubs affiliated to the ICC in accordance with the terms of two licences granted by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p><p>A Monitoring Committee on Coursing is in place, comprising officials from my Department, the ICC and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), to monitor developments in coursing.  I believe that it is critically important that those involved in coursing operate in accordance with the regulatory framework and that the welfare of both hares and greyhounds is kept in mind at all times. The allegations of an illegal coursing meeting set out in the recent RTE Investigates Programme are currently examined by Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

There was a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices lasting from autumn 2018 to spring 2019, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance. </p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings and in direct consultation with the Commission. </p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. Building on this is the exchequer funded Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million pilot project for 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP, and through the next Agri Food strategy to 2030. My view is that such measures should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.</p></reply>

My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its importance to the agri-food sector, while placing a strong emphasis on the welfare<b></b>of all animals being transported.</p><p>In 2018, total live exports of cattle increased by over 30% compared to 2017, to 246,000 head.

Hares can only be collected for coursing by clubs affiliated to the ICC, in accordance with the terms of two licences granted by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  These licences contain 26 conditions which have been refined over the years, the majority of which are central to hare welfare. These include a variety of measures, including a requirement that a qualified veterinarian attends all coursing meetings to report on the health of the hares, a prohibition on the coursing of hares more than once in the same day, a prohibition on the coursing of sick or pregnant hares and a requirement that hares be released back into the wild during daylight hours. </p>  <p>  The ICC also attends to the welfare of the hare and undertakes a range of actions to address issues related to health and welfare. Coursing clubs are required to comply with directives, instructions and guidance notes issued by the ICC in all matters relating to the capture, keeping in captivity, tagging, marking, coursing and release of hares, and the muzzling of greyhounds.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Committee on Coursing is in place, comprising officials from my Department, the ICC and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), to monitor developments in coursing and, in that regard, the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of both hares and greyhounds. </p>  <p>  The Habitats Directive ensures the conservation of a wide range of rare, threatened or endemic animal and plant species. Some 200 rare and characteristic habitat types are also targeted for conservation in their own right. </p>  <p>  The report of the EU Directive 92/43/EEC is a matter for the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht  and the findings will be discussed at the next monitoring committee meeting following its publication. </p>  <p>  I believe that it is critically important that those involved in coursing operate in accordance with the regulatory framework and that the welfare of both hares and greyhounds is prevalent at all times.</p></reply>

I am advised that the forest fire of May 2017 was fought along three separate fronts - a bog fire, a thicket fire and the most dangerous of all, a tree crown fire.  The fire was tackled for five days by more than 35 Coillte staff and contractors, three helicopters, two fire tenders and as well as 30 army personnel to finally bring it under control. </p><p>Cloosh is also home to the Galway Wind Park renewable energy development and contains millions of euro of wind turbines and associated infrastructure.  Through the hard work and dedication of all the firefighters, none of the nationally important wind energy structures were damaged by the fire.</p><p>Coillte also advise that subsequent to the fire being brought under control, they completed a detailed and precise inventory of the damage to Cloosh using a combination of Aerial Photography and Ground Survey techniques.  Coillte local management also developed a Forest Management Plan for the area, aimed at categorising the damage and determining the regeneration plan required to re-establish the forest.</p><p>Results of this inventory show that the total area in Cloosh that was damaged by fire was 1,213 ha.  Of this figure, 828 ha was categorised as forest, with the balance of 385 ha being classified as non-forest (e.g. Bare, Undeveloped, Swamp, peatlands).</p><p>Coillte advise that costs of the forest fires to them are calculated across a variety of different activities required to both bring the fire under control and subsequently to prepare and replant the forest and, of course, the loss of value of the standing timber.  The costs involved can be broken down into the following headings:</p><p><b>Fire-Fighting costs</b>&ndash; Direct costs involved in bringing the fire under control;</p><p><b>Clean up costs</b>&ndash; these costs are to make the site fit for regeneration or replanting following the fire.  The actual costs will depend on the extent of replanting the forested areas and any offsetting revenue from harvesting the damaged timber;</p><p><b>Regeneration cost</b>&ndash; this is the cost to replant the non-productive forest area and is dependent on the level and type of planting that Coillte undertake; </p><p><b>Additional Project costs</b>&ndash; the costs of any additional projects that may be required from extra overheads incurred in managing the area;</p><p><b>Depletion cost</b>&ndash; this reflects the costs of depleting the total forested area less an area of 67 ha which had been recently felled before the fire.</p><p>Overall, the total cost of the Cloosh fire is estimated by Coillte at approximately &euro;3 million. Coillte add that they are not aware of any prosecutions for breach of section 40 of the Wildlife Acts resulting from the fire at Cloosh.  <b></b></p><p>Finally, I believe that the recommendations of the 2017 Government Task Force report on wildfires informed preparedness and operational responses to wildfire during the very challenging 2018 fire season. Recommendations particularly influenced improvements in respect of air support readiness and military aid to civil power support for firefighting interventions at large scale wildfires. These improvements were readily apparent during the extended firefighting operations in the Slieve Bloom Mountains during July 2018 and at several other large scale incidents across the country at that time. </p><p>My Department continues to issue forest fire warnings where appropriate, particularly in advance of high-risk periods such as high temperatures. These include advice on preparedness and appropriate responses and are intended to inform relevant stakeholders and the general public.</p></reply>

Given that the scientific outlook had changed, the scheme was therefore suspended in April 2018, in order that a comprehensive review could be undertaken. However landowners who wished to continue growing their ash forest, where the presence of the disease was low, could continue to be paid their annual premiums.</p>  <p>  The review process has included stakeholder and public consultation and detailed field consideration of damage level evaluation together with an examination of a  broader range of silvicultural and management options available to forest owners. Advice from Teagasc and international experts has also been received. Current support schemes were examined  to ensure their continued relevance and that they represent  value for money for both the taxpayer and the forest owner.  It seems that a broader and more responsive range of options will be  needed to assist forest owners in managing affected forests and consideration is currently being given to the financial aspects of this new approach. </p>  <p>  I hope to be in a position to announce the full results of the review shortly.</p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 prioritises the potential for growth in new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  Trade Missions play an important role in this market development. I have been very active on this front in 2019, with successful trade missions completed to date to Turkey, China, Japan and Korea.</p>  <p>  In May, during the China Trade mission, I met with Zhang Jiwen - Vice Minister of General Administration of Customs in China (GACC) and his officials. After this meeting, I was able to confirm that we have commenced the first steps with regard to market access for sheepmeat to China. Officials from GACC will visit Ireland this August to inspect five sheep meat plants that wish to export to China.  </p>  <p>  In June, on the Japanese trade mission, I met both my counterpart, Japanese Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), Takamori Yoshikawa and the Vice Minister for Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), Masayoshi Shintani. These Ministerial meetings followed detailed technical meetings involving senior officials from both Ministries. At the conclusion of these meetings,  I was delighted to announce that we had reached agreement in principle on market access for Irish sheepmeat. Details will be finalised by an exchange of letters between my Department and the relevant Japanese officials</p>  <p>  These achievements are tangible results of the increased focus of my Department on opening and enhancing access to key markets. This success has taken detailed work by our market access experts, audit and inspection visits by competent authorities from international markets, and an intensified agri-food trade mission agenda. This work is informed and supported by Bord Bia&rsquo;s market insights, strategic marketing and promotion programme.  This intensive work programme reflects our shared Food Wise strategy and represents a fundamental and practical response to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p></reply>

All allegations will be examined to determine the appropriate actions. In addition to its focus on the core business of greyhound racing, Bord na gCon places an emphasis on regulation of the industry and the welfare of greyhounds. It is evident that the successful growth and sustainability of the industry is heavily dependent on public confidence in the integrity of racing. </p><p>It is worth noting that the Greyhound Sector has undergone a series of reforms in recent times and the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 was signed by the President on the 28<sup>th</sup>May 2019. The drafting of this legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability. To this end, I welcome the fact that Bord na gCon will continue to invest significant resources into regulation and greyhound welfare.</p><p>Under the Act, Bord na gCon may make regulations to require the registration of greyhound owners, the registration of racing greyhounds and the notification by owners, breeders and trainers of greyhounds of many more life events than those currently captured on existing studbook and micro-chipping databases. The regulations will support establishment of a new comprehensive tracing database for racing greyhounds. </p><p>In recent days, Bord na gCon has also announced a series of measures that will be implemented: </p><p>- The introduction of a greyhound injury support scheme to provide financial assistance to aid injured greyhounds to continue with a healthy life.</p><p>- Extending and increasing support for foster care of greyhounds to identify new foster homes within Ireland for greyhounds.</p><p>- Revision, in conjunction with the International Greyhound Welfare Forum, of the Code of Practice on the Care and Welfare of the Greyhound to address retirement and transportation of greyhounds.</p><p>- Financially incentivise the rehoming of greyhounds in Ireland through the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust (which assisted in the rehoming of 1,021 greyhounds last year).</p><p>- Intensify the inspection regime of greyhound establishments (491 inspections were undertaken in 2018).</p><p>- Preparation of a statutory instrument to make it a legal requirement that euthanasia of a greyhound must be carried out by a veterinary practitioner. (This is already the standard expected under the IGB Code of Practice for the Care and Welfare of the Greyhound).</p><p>- Provision of the Code of Practice to all registered greyhound owners </p><p>- Progress the traceability provisions of the Greyhound Act 2019 </p><p>- Establish a confidential Freephone line to enable reports of welfare breaches to be reported to the IGB for investigation by relevant agencies.</p><p>Minister Doyle will be meeting with the Board of Bord na gCon this week to discuss these and any other measures that may be required to bring about comprehensive changes in the sector. For these reasons, an action plan for the industry will be carefully considered and announced by my Department in due course.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the practices highlighted in the RTE Prime Time programme will be fully addressed. It is in the interests of the greyhound sector to operate at the highest ethical and welfare standards and that is what the citizens of this country expect.</p></reply>

My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its importance to the agri-food sector, while placing a strong emphasis on the welfare<b></b>of all animals being transported.</p><p>In 2018, total live exports of cattle increased by over 30% compared to 2017, to 246,000 head. This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports already totalling 225,000 up until the week ending the 23rd of June. This is up from 173,000 for the same period in 2018 &ndash; a 30% increase. </p><p>This increase is in part down to my decision to reduce the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20. This has brought greater equity to the inspection fee regime. Since then, there has been continued growth in the export of calves, rising from 102,000 in 2017 to 159,000 in 2018. We have already surpassed this figure in 2019, with 184,000 calves having been exported in the year to date.</p><p>My Department continues to prioritise efforts to deepen existing markets and gain access to new third country markets. In early May, my Department hosted a visit by a Turkish technical team, including officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and ESK (the Turkish Meat and Milk Board). The objective of the visit was to conduct an on-site fact-finding mission to evaluate the technical aspects of live animal and germinal product exports from Ireland to Turkey. This is yet another welcome development as we seek to re-establish our live trade with Turkey. The visit by Turkish officials follows on from my March meeting with my Turkish counterpart, Dr Bekir Pakdemirli, Minister for Agriculture and Forestry.</p><p>With regard to other third country markets:</p><p>- In April, my Department reached agreement with the Egyptian authorities on three proposed health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle. </p><p>- Also in April, a departmental Technical Delegation to Algeria reached agreement on three revised and separate health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle.  My technical experts moved quickly to oversee the changes to the health certificates and we await Algerian authorities imprimatur prior to the commencement of the revised trade conditions.</p><p>- I met with the Kazakh Ambassador in late March to discuss new health certification for the trade of live animals to Kazakhstan. Progress was made in relation to opening the Kazakh market. </p><p>With regard to animal welfare, my Department maintains robust oversight of live trade, through a comprehensive legislative framework, and in my meetings with exporters, I have stressed the importance of high animal welfare standards. Irish legislation on sea transport is recognised by the European Commission as being among the most effective and stringent legislation in force on transport by sea.  </p><p>As has been the case in recent weeks, with regard to road transport, the Department does not approve journey logs from exporters for any live export where the destination country has an orange or red weather alert in place, or where a significant part of the transit route goes through an orange or red alert area. This is in addition to the annual ban on road transport of livestock to Greece, North Africa and Turkey during the months of July and August.</p><p>Furthermore, my Department continues to proactively contribute to efforts to improve animal welfare standards during transport.  My Department is currently providing multiannual funding of &euro;75,000 per year over four years to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) towards the implementation of the second Action Plan of the OIE Platform on Animal Welfare for Europe, in relation to slaughter and transport, within Europe and between Europe and the Middle East and North Africa.</p></reply>

I was pleased to launch the Scheme earlier this year with my colleagues, and I recently attended Bank of Ireland's own launch of the product. Bank of Ireland is open for applications and drawdowns of approved loans. The SBCI continue to engage with other banks on their timetable for the Scheme and additional announcements in this regard are expected shortly.</p>  <p>  The Scheme was developed by my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in partnership with the Department of Finance, the SBCI and the European Investment Fund (EIF). It will be delivered through participating finance providers and make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. </p>  <p>  The loans will be competitively priced with an initial maximum loan interest rate of 4.5% for loans less than &euro;250,000. The loans are for terms of 8-10 years and unsecured up to &euro;500,000. This type of innovative finance, which has been previously unavailable in the Irish market, will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. </p>  <p>  A minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 applies up to a maximum of &euro;3,000,000 per applicant. However, considering the needs of Irish farmers, I have negotiated a specific minimum of &euro;50,000 for them.</p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution. </p>  <p>  Food companies have identified long term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that the Government have been able to deliver this product and its effects will be felt all along the food production chain, from primary producer to processor.</p></reply>

The Government's Climate Action Plan 2019 recognises the key role afforestation has to play in climate change mitigation particularly through carbon sequestration. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan now sets a target of an average of 8,000 hectares of new planting per year. </p>  <p>  While planting rates in recent years have been less than expected, I believe this is due to a number of factors, including competiton for land and increasing land prices in recent years. The role of my Department is to secure an annual budget for new forests and also to act as the planning authority in assessing applications for these new sites. It is worth noting that we have approved an average of 9,000 hectares per annum for afforestation over the last 3 years, but the conversion rate to planting remains on average around 60% of the approval issued.  This means the Irish forestry sector currently has at its disposal almost 10,000 hectares of approved and shovel-ready land which could be planted today. The challenge is to ensure that all the effort that goes into securing and approving new sites results in those sites being planted, if the planting levels are to increase. </p>  <p>  In response, my Department has funded a number of new promotion initiatives. We are funding Teagasc to carry out a Forestry Promotion Campaign covering the period 2018 &ndash; 2020 specifically aimed at farmers. My Department has also funded a carbon navigator for forestry that will help illustrate to farmers the valuable contribution forestry can make in removing carbon from our atmosphere. This new tool will be launched later this year.  Furthermore,  15 promotion projects around the Country were approved earlier this year, which will roll out initiatives which highlight the multifunctional benefits of forestry, promote planting of more trees and encourage sustainable forest management. </p>  <p>  We also introduced higher rates and additional measures under  the midterm review of the Forestry Programme in 2018, aimed particularly at boosting the planting of broadleaves and native woodlands. These measures have paid off and, so far, broadleaf planting has increased from 21% in 2017 to 27% in 2018. There has been an increase in Native Woodlands planted too, with 172 hectares planted so far in 2019, up over 95% compared to the previous year.  </p>  <p>  Another interesting development has been the  launch of the Woodland Environmental Fund in September, 2018 This  provides an opportunity for businesses to partner with the Government and Irish landowners and get behind the national effort to plant an additional 5 million native trees between now and 2020. </p>  <p>  It is clear that we need all actors to participate in the national afforestation programme, which is why I  very much welcome Coillte's recently announced Coillte Nature initiative. The primary objective of this initiative is to deliver new woodlands which provide species diversity, biodiversity, have carbon sequestration potential and can be used for enjoyment by the public.  We have had active engagement with Coillte on this matter and now  look forward to receiving applications for the conversion of a number of Coillte's commercial forests to native woodland, which  may be funded under the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme. I am aware too that Coillte has started discussions with Bord na Mona in relation to possibilities for a joint venture to increase native forest cover on Bord na Mona lands, something which I am  supportive of and hope will contribute to our afforestation targets. </p>  <p>  My Department also operates a community based woodland scheme called the Neighbourwood scheme. This Scheme is designed to help community groups, in cooperation with local authorities, to develop opportunities for recreation while creating and developing woodlands for the benefit of current and future generations. The scheme is also designed to provide outdoor classrooms for teachers to show children the important contribution forests make to society in terms of social, economic and environmental benefits.</p>  <p>  As can be seen, a range of approaches are being taken to address the challenge of increasing planting and  especially the proportion of native and broadleaf planting. We will continue to offer generous grants and premiums to landowners to make the switch to forestry, we will use all avenues to promote and support that change, as well as supporting Coillte's endeavours and we will examine how forestry can be better integrated into the new CAP. I firmly believe that all of these measures will lead to an increase in our forestry land cover.</p></reply>

The aim of the Commonage action within GLAS is to ensure that commonage lands are appropriately grazed and managed and are compliant with eligibility criteria. The scheme requires that management plans are put into place in order to achieve this.</p>  <p>  The Spring of 2017 was characterised by a spell of dry weather. It was apparent during the closed season for burning that there was widespread burning of growing vegetation. There were several high-profile fires such as in Killery, which impacted on the lands concerned and the local and wider environment. </p>  <p>  The Department, in the administration of the Basic Payment Scheme, contacted 33 farmers in relation to ineligible land due to burning on Killery mountain.  29 of these farmers lodged appeals with my Department on this issue.  Where the applicant provided appropriate evidence that he/she was not involved in the burning of the affected lands, the administrative penalty was waived &ndash; however, the burnt land remained ineligible for payment.   </p>  <p>  Of the 29 cases that appealed, some 13 farmers submitted a further appeal to the Independent Agriculture Appeals office. Oral hearings were held between October 2018 and February 2019. No decision has been received to date on these appeals.</p>  <p>  As per GLAS terms and conditions, farmers admitted to the scheme must submit a payment claim annually within the deadline for the submission of Basic Payment Scheme applications. For the purposes of GLAS, the annual payment claim forms part of the annual Basic Payment Scheme application. In these cases, as the claims have been reduced on the Basic Payment application, the GLAS payment is reduced in turn. As GLAS is a multi-annual scheme, this lower reference is retained for the duration of the GLAS contract. When the position regarding the Basic Payment Scheme is finalised, a decision can then be taken as to their GLAS scheme payments.</p></reply>

GLAS promotes practices to assist the preservation of habitats and species as well as addressing the issues of climate change mitigation and water quality, in support of sustainable Irish agriculture. Since the launch of GLAS tranche 1 in 2015, the Scheme has been extremely successful in terms of uptake with in excess of 50,000 farmers approved into the GLAS scheme over the first three tranches (GLAS 1, 2 and 3). The Rural Development Programme participation target of 50,000 was exceeded almost two years ahead of schedule.   </p>  <p>  Payment is then provided for selected actions, generally up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per annum for five years with provision for up to &euro;7,000 (known as GLAS+) in a limited number of cases where the farmer is required to give exceptional environmental commitments.</p>  <p>  In 2019 the allocation for GLAS (including GLAS training) is &euro;203m. The expenditure so far in 2019 is &euro;50.5m in terms of GLAS payments and &euro;357,884 in respect of GLAS training. Currently over 95% of active participants have received their 2018 balancing payment meaning that they are fully up to date with payments. Those with outstanding actions have been advised of their requirements to be completed before they can receive their balancing payment. GLAS payments will continue to issue on a weekly basis as further participants pass the required validation checks. Payments in respect of the 2019 scheme year will commence in mid-November as per previous years.</p>  <p>  The Knowledge Transfer Scheme is now in its third year. Under the scheme, participant farmers receive training in a group setting with their peers and subject matter experts in order to up-skill and inform farmers on best practice and new methods of farming to increase productivity and reduce costs etc. These groups are run by trained group facilitators (Agricultural Advisors).</p>  <p>  &euro;23m has been allocated to the scheme each calendar year while &euro;20.73m and &euro;18.59m respectively were the expenditure amounts for the initial two years of the scheme. Year 3 payments will commence later in 2019.</p></reply>

The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. Other groups, most notably ISIS, have also perpetrated atrocities. Over 6 million people are displaced inside Syria, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. As the conflict enters its ninth year, nearly 12 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, and more than 80 per cent of people live below the poverty line. </p>  <p>  In recent months, there has been an escalation of the conflict in the north-west of Syria, in the area around Idlib and northern Hama. Conflict there between the regime and other armed groups has killed over 230 civilians, has displaced more than 330,000 people, and has left hundreds injured. I condemn in particular the airstrikes, including barrel bombs, that are reported to have deliberately targeted medical facilities and schools. Those with influence on the Syrian regime have a responsibility to exert pressure to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. </p>  <p>  On 27 June 2019, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini issued a statement on behalf of the EU expressing deep concern over the situation in the north-west of Syria, strongly condemning the indiscriminate attacks on civilians, and calling on all sides to immediately cease hostilities, and to ensure the protection of, and unhindered humanitarian assistance, to the civilian population.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU support the UN-led efforts to bring about a political resolution to the conflict, in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council Resolution 2254. The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, is currently focusing his efforts on establishing a constitutional committee, made up of Syrians of different political views, to chart the way forward for the country and unlock a broader political process. Such a process - which should be Syrian-led - will be essential to returning the country to stability. The UN Special Envoy has been engaging directly with Russia, Turkey and Iran on this, and we believe that they have a responsibility to support and assist his efforts. The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent donor to the Syria crisis response and our overall funding supports those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region. In March 2019, Ireland pledged a further &euro;25 million to the crisis, bringing the total amount of humanitarian assistance committed to the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis. To date, Ireland has disbursed &euro;138m of this funding. Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.</p>  <p>  Humanitarian aid will not solve the conflict, though it is important in mitigating its impact on ordinary people. Any sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict requires a genuine political transition, and at the EU-League of Arab States Ministerial meeting in February, I made this point to my EU and Arab counterparts. Ireland and the EU firmly believe that eight years of war have shown that military action cannot bring lasting peace to Syria.</p></reply>

We are also aware of reports on the conditions in which some migrant children and their families are being kept.</p>  <p>  I have not specifically raised this issue with the US Administration;  however, I and my officials hold regular and constructive discussions with US officials on a range of issues. The new US Ambassador to Ireland, Edward Crawford, has just arrived in Ireland and I look forward to discussing the full range of political issues with him in the near future. </p>  <p>  Ireland, for its part, closely abides by the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which we have ratified and which sets out clear universal standards and protections for all children.</p>  <p>  Article 3 of the Convention states parties shall ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of their staff, as well as competent supervision.</p>  <p>  Article 9 of the Convention states parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child. Such determination may be necessary in a particular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parents, or one where the parents are living separately and a decision must be made as to the child's place of residence. </p>  <p>  I note with regret that the United States has signed the CRC but has not ratified it. Ireland is supportive of the implementation of policies globally which live up to the values of the CRC and, in this regard, I hope the situation for migrant children and families, around the world, can be improved.</p></reply>

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation of Migration announced last month that the number of Venezuelans who have left the country since 2015 has now reached over 4 million. </p>  <p>  The needs of the Venezuelan people are acute. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 25% of the population, approximately 7 million people, are in need of humanitarian assistance. Health and medical needs are severe with many reported cases of diseases that had previously been eradicated or near eradication and a widespread lack of access to medicines and medical care. Ireland is fully supportive of the UN-coordinated response mechanism for humanitarian aid in the country, and of the &euro;117 million in EU funding since 2018 for humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  I am also deeply concerned by reported human rights abuses in Venezuela. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet painted a worrying picture of repression and a lack of respect for fundamental freedoms in the country after her visit last month. However, I welcome the engagement of the Government of Venezuela with the Office of High Commissioner Bachelet, and that the Government has agreed that a small team of human rights officers from the Office can be based in the country in order to provide technical assistance and advice, as well as to continue to monitor the human rights situation there. I would urge the Venezuelan authorities to cooperate fully with this team, and to allow them unrestricted access so that they can fully carry out their mandate. </p>  <p>  The recent death of army captain Rafael Acosta Ar&eacute;valo while in the custody of the Venezuelan security services further highlights the need for the human rights situation in the country to be addressed.  It is another illustration of the arbitrary nature of the judicial system in the country and the lack of guarantees and rights for those under detention. I fully support the EU statement issued on 30 June that calls for a full and independent investigation into Captain Ar&eacute;valo's death, and that highlights the EU's support for the efforts of High Commissioner Bachelet to ensure that the human rights of all Venezuelans are fully protected. </p>  <p>  Captain Ar&eacute;valo's death also underscores the urgency of the need to find a solution to this complex crisis. I continue to believe that this crisis can only have a political, peaceful, democratic solution, excluding the use of force, through the holding of free, transparent and credible Presidential elections as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The EU continues to work towards this goal, and Ireland fully supports the EU&rsquo;s International Contact Group&rsquo;s dual aims of finding a negotiated electoral path and of enabling the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance. I also welcome the recent appointment by EU High Representative Mogherini of an EU Special Adviser for Venezuela, Mr Enrique Iglesias. Special Adviser Iglesias will be well placed to engage with relevant stakeholders in Venezuela, and with international and regional actors, in the search for a peaceful solution to the crisis.   </p>  <p>  Ireland also welcomes the talks process between the Maduro administration and the opposition, facilitated by Norway, that is currently ongoing in Oslo. Ireland, along with the EU, stands ready to support this process. I fully support the statement released by High Representative/Vice President Federica Mogherini on 18 June, which underlines the EU's support for this process and calls on all Venezuelan stakeholders to engage in this process in good faith and to pave the way for its success through concrete confidence-building measures.</p></reply>

The published document sets out a range of possibilities for economic revitalisation and growth for Palestinians and the neighbouring countries, which could be achieved if the parties can agree a settlement of the conflict, and large scale international investment can be attracted to the region. Part of the purpose of the workshop, which was aimed primarily at Gulf Arab States, was to introduce the plan to such possible donors or investors. Ireland was not represented at the meeting. </p>  <p>  I have always been clear in my view that an economic element can help support a well-thought out political solution, by setting out a vision of a post conflict situation in which all are winners. But as I have stated consistently, it is not possible to solve political problems by economic means alone. Support to the Palestinian people is of course always important and welcome. However, any potential investor or donor, public or private, will be very conscious that the main impediment to economic development for Palestinians, and the reason for the severe contraction of the Palestinian economy over the last two decades, is the web of restrictions due to the Israeli occupation. It is thus very difficult to discuss economic possibilities separate from the political context. </p>  <p>  The EU has encouraged the US in its efforts to develop a peace plan, and Ireland has done this in all our contacts with the US Middle East team. It is my strong view that any plan must address the needs of both sides if it is to be successful. Preparing the ground can also be crucial to winning a considered hearing for any plan, and improved dialogue between the US team and Palestinian community and its leadership will be important in this regard.</p></reply>

We will continue our efforts in this regard until we secure progress &ndash; both in terms of future legal immigration opportunities for Irish citizens, and also in securing a pathway for those Irish who are undocumented in order to regularise their status.  Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, John Deasy T.D., has also worked closely on these issues with my Department.   </p>  <p>  I visited the US in early February, for a series of engagements with the US Administration and Congressional leaders.  I raised immigration issues in these meetings, as I have done in all my interactions with the US Administration and US political leaders since taking office.  Additionally, the Taoiseach had a range of engagements at the highest levels of the US Administration and with Congressional leaders over the St Patrick's Day period. </p>  <p>  In April, I was delighted to host events to mark the visit of the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and to have the opportunity to discuss with her and the Congressional delegation a range of topics of mutual concern.  Deputy Deasy also participated in the programme, as did officials from my Department.  Through those events and meetings with the Taoiseach and Minister Donohoe, I believe the Speaker and delegation were fully briefed on Irish interests, including on immigration issues and our concerns for those Irish who are undocumented in the US.</p>  <p>  These engagements have already borne fruit.  I was pleased to note that an E3 Bill, which if passed, would offer new opportunities for Irish citizens to live and work in the US, was recently reintroduced into the US Congress. Much work still needs to be done for this Bill to become law, and we are under no illusions as to the challenging path ahead. Our Embassy in Washington, D.C. is focusing its efforts on securing the passage of this E3 Bill but we have also not lost sight of the issue of the undocumented Irish in America and the Government, as well as Irish officials across the US, continue to engage on this issue and advocate on behalf of this vulnerable community. </p>  <p>  In addition to this work, my Department, including through our Embassy and Consulates in the US, work alongside the Irish Immigration Centres across the US on an ongoing basis to provide support to those Irish who are undocumented. Each Irish Centre receives significant Government funding through the Emigrant Support Programme for its work, including support for vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. In 2018, over &euro;3 million was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including the Irish Centres.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must satisfy one of the following conditions: </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme cost &euro;65m in each of 2016 and 2017, rising to &euro;70m in 2018. This figure does not include the revenue foregone in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>I understand and fully sympathise with any person who suffers from a serious physical disability and can&rsquo;t access the scheme under the current criteria. However, given the scope and scale of the scheme, any possible changes to it can only be made after careful consideration, taking into account the existing and prospective cost of the scheme as well as the availability of other schemes which seek to help with the mobility of disabled persons, and the interaction between each of these schemes.  </p><p>Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the qualifying medical criteria for the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme at this time.</p></reply>

In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation from April 2015. Revenue have also conducted random National Sampling Programmes in the years 2016 to 2019, to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud and the results of Revenue&rsquo;s sampling programmes support this view.  </p>  <p>  With regard to solid fuel, I indicated in a recent PQ response that I am advised that Revenue is in contact at present with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel, for which that Department has responsibility, and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that solid fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here. I understand that contacts are ongoing with a view to undertaking a number of joint operations and to explore the scope for follow up action by Revenue in relation to persons found to be in breach of environmental regulations.</p>  <p>  Revenue acts against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade, and uses a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, and risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages to intercept illicit products. Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. </p>  <p>  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against fuel and tobacco crime, and also cooperate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups responsible for much of this criminality, who operate across jurisdictions. Recent successes include the detection of an illegal cigarette factory in Jenkinstown, Co. Louth, in March 2018, as well as the detection of a second cigarette factory in Knockbridge, Co. Louth, in March 2019.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success. For my part, I will fully consider any additional proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue which would enhance its capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in these areas.</p></reply>

I currently have no plans to re-introduce the scheme which terminated in accordance with its sunset clause on 31 December 2018.</p>  <p>  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, the introduction of new tax incentive measures should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p>  <p>  The HRI was introduced at a time when there was considerable loss of employment within the construction sector, with the aim of addressing this market failure by stimulating increased activity in the sector. In the current context of a growing economy and construction sector, the initial objectives of the scheme have been fulfilled, and this support is no longer needed in the terms in which it was originally envisaged.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in light of the current housing supply shortage, and the need to deliver 25,000 additional housing units per annum over the period 2017-2021, there is a risk that a reintroduction of the HRI could lead to increased competition for scarce resources within the construction sector, leading to upward pressure on construction costs and house prices. The potential for displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations would create a high opportunity cost of labour associated with HRI which was not present at the inception of the scheme. As of 2 January 2019, the cost to the Exchequer of the HRI was c. &euro;105 million, with a further &euro;65 million worth of credits yet to be claimed in respect of the incentive. As the Deputy will appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer; tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.</p>  <p>  In relation the tax incentive measures for domestic owner-occupiers to renovate their properties, the Living City Initiative (ss.372AAA - 372AAD of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997) which applies to buildings constructed before 1915 located in special regeneration areas in the cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick or Waterford; and the Relief for expenditure on significant buildings and gardens (s.482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997) which applies to buildings which are of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, both provide such relief.</p></reply>

However, there are two that have a fixed statutory end date of 31 December 2019; i.e. certain properties purchased between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013 and trading stock of builder/developer sold in the period 1 January 2013 to 31 October 2019. The number of exemptions claimed is 11,700 and 5,200, respectively. These exemptions have their statutory basis in sections 8 and 9 Finance, respectively, (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended).  In line with my decision to defer the revaluation date to 1 November 2020, all exemptions will be further extended to this date and any necessary legislative provisions will be introduced in due course in an amending LPT Bill.</p>  <p>  There is a distinction to be made between (i) exempted properties, which have been detailed above, and (ii) properties built since 2013 which are not liable for LPT. The figures above do not include properties completed after 1 May 2013. That category should be distinguished from those properties that were completed by 1 May 2013. The post 1 May 2013 completed properties do not have to be exempted from LPT as such, because they do not actually come within the ambit of LPT. As they did not exist on 1 May 2013, they will be outside the charge to LPT until the next valuation date of 1 November 2020. The owners of these properties are not required to submit LPT returns or valuations to Revenue, consequently their number is not known by Revenue and Revenue does not compile or publish statistics on these properties.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of the LPT review, Revenue and the Dept. of Finance compiled estimates of the potential number of such properties from a combination of Revenue&rsquo;s Stamp Duty files, CSO data and other information. There are an estimated 60,000-80,000 such properties, depending on the time period being examined.</p></reply>

It seems that the question may relate to a potential future inheritance passing between siblings, in which case, the Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) which applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a brother or sister of the disponer would be relevant. </p>  <p>  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives inheritances that are in excess of his or her relevant tax-free threshold, inheritance tax at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax-free threshold.</p>  <p>  While there are no specific reliefs provided for siblings living together, they may bequeath assets to each other free from inheritance tax provided the value of the assets does not exceed the relevant tax-free Group thresholds when previous gifts and bequests to the individual are considered.  </p>  <p>  In addition, siblings can avail of the &lsquo;dwelling house exemption&rsquo; to bequeath their principal private residence to another sibling which allows for property to be inherited tax-free irrespective of its value subject to certain conditions. The main conditions are that the beneficiary must have lived in the house that was the sole residence of the disponer for at least three year prior to the inheritance and for six years after the inheritance and must not have an interest in any other house</p></reply>

This year&rsquo;s allocation for apprenticeship training is &euro;142m which represents an increase of over 16% on the 2018 allocation of &euro;122m.  Since 2015 new apprenticeship registrations have increased by 80% with 5,648 new registrations by the end of 2018. In addition, following two calls for proposals in 2015 and 2017 by the Apprenticeship Council, to date twenty new apprenticeship programmes have been developed and are now operational to complement the existing 25 craft apprenticeships.</p><p>These include three chef apprenticeships in the hospitality sector in the occupations of commis chef, chef de partie and sous chef. A further programme in the occupation of executive chef is also in development and due to be rolled out in 2020.  </p><p>It is important to note that the structure of these new consortia led apprenticeship programmes are different to those in the craft trades. Our new consortia-led apprenticeships offer more flexibility to employers in meeting their skill needs both in the duration of the programme and in terms of the delivery of the off-the-job training. These new apprenticeship programmes vary in length from 2 to 4 years and have different methods of off-the-job training such as one day per week, as is the case with the chef apprenticeships, and on-line blended learning rather than the traditional block release of up to 22 weeks in an education setting, as is the case in the craft trades.  While there is no training allowance paid to apprentices undertaking one of our new apprenticeships, I am aware that some employers engaged in the system have raised this as an issue. However, any change in this regard, which has not yet been costed by the Department, would have to form part of the normal budgetary process and be considered in the broader context of competing demands and the overall availability of resources. </p><p>In addition to the apprenticeship programmes, there are a range of other programmes available in the hospitality area across further education and training and higher education settings. Similarly, there are employer-led training supported through Skillnet Ireland, such as the Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet, which was established in 2017, and the Taste 4 Success Skillnet to address skill needs in the sector. </p><p>Details of apprentice population per apprenticeship programme as requested by the deputy are set out in the following tabular statement.  <table><tr><th colspan="5">Apprentice Population</th></tr><tr><td>20 New Apprenticeships developed Since 2016</td><td>2016</td><td>2017</td><td>2018</td><td>2019*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>AUCTIONEERING</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Auctioneering &amp;amp; property services</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>52</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td>52</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>BIOPHARMACHEM</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Laboratory Analyst</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Laboratory Technician</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>14</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>14</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Industrial Electrical Engineering</td><td>12</td><td>31 </td><td>54</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>12</td><td>31 </td><td>54</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>ENGINEERING </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Engineering (Level 6)</td><td>n/a</td><td>39 </td><td>73</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Engineering (Level 7)</td><td>n/a</td><td>36</td><td>55</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Polymer Processing Technology</td><td>n/a</td><td>23 </td><td>38</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Original Equipment and Manufacture (OEM)</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>n/a</td><td>98 </td><td>166</td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td>FINANCE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Accounting Technician</td><td>n/a</td><td>71 </td><td>146</td><td>175</td></tr><tr><td>Insurance Practice</td><td>67</td><td>138 </td><td>197</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>International Financial Services Associate</td><td>n/a</td><td>14 </td><td>25</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>International Financial Services Specialist</td><td>n/a</td><td>14 </td><td>24</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>67</td><td>237 </td><td>392</td><td>416</td></tr><tr><td>FOOD MANUFACTURING</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Butcher</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>7</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>7</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>HOSPITALITY </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chef de Partie</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>27</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Commis Chef</td><td>n/a</td><td>25</td><td>105</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>Sous Chef</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>n/a</td><td>25</td><td>132</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>ICT</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ICT Associate Professional Network Technician</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>22</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>ICT Associate Professional Software Developer</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>38</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>Cybersecurity Associate</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>60</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>LOGISTICS</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Logistics Associate</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>27</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>79</td><td>391</td><td>904</td><td>993</td></tr></table></p><p>* Latest figure as of the 31st May 2019</p></reply>

The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances is a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish it's enrolment policy.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of the Department.</p><p>Parents/guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.  Contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>The NCSE also works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at .</p><p>Where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. The availability of a school placement is assessed by the NCSE having regard to, although not limited to, the relevant diagnosis and relevant professional report.</p><p>Accordingly, the NCSE advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible. Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.</p><p>As the matter raised by the Deputy refers to a particular child, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the National Council for Special Education for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

This includes the expansion of the apprenticeship and traineeship schemes, additional investment in Springboard and additional support to increase skills for those in employment through Skillnet Ireland.</p><p>The surplus in the NTF at the end of 2018 amounted to &euro;473m. The accumulated surplus in the NTF has previously been critical in maintaining expenditure levels, particularly in the provision of training for the unemployed, in recession years when NTF income declined.  It is clearly prudent to continue to maintain an adequate surplus in the Fund to meet demand in future years and while the surplus represents a very significant amount, it would only cover twelve month's NTF expenditure at current levels. </p><p>A further increase in NTF spending estimated at &euro;70m approximately is expected to take place in 2020 on the basis of the further +0.1% increase in the Training Levy.  </p><p>This will be supplemented in 2020 by &euro;60m investment in the Human Capital Initiative (HCI) also funded from the NTF announced in Estimates 2019.  The HCI is a 5-year programme of increased investment in priority skills in higher education amounting to &euro;300m over the period 2020 - 2024.</p><p>Details in relation to NTF income and expenditure in each of the years from 2000 to date as requested by the Deputy are in the table.  The Deputy should note that NTF accounts for 2001 include the period from the NTF's establishment on 21 December 2000 to 31 December 2001. <table><tr><th></th><th>Income from National Training Fund Levy</th><th>Total Expenditure from fund</th></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>187,921,236</td><td>168,941,224</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>239,000,000</td><td>204,583,430</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>250,000,000</td><td>233,722,861</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>273,000,000</td><td>276,678,337</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>327,000,000</td><td>312,738,093</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>366,000,000</td><td>352,718,974</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>408,000,000</td><td>394,589,181</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>413,000,000</td><td>399,146,178</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>372,000,000</td><td>366,482,465</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>309,000,000</td><td>395,221,768</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>316,000,000</td><td>326,269,322</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>299,000,000</td><td>340,896,121</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>317,000,000</td><td>348,804,784</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>338,000,000</td><td>346,906,382</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>364,000,000</td><td>334,210,109</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>390,000,000</td><td>344,399,000</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>431,000,000</td><td>357,230,000</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>565,500,000</td><td>415,394,000</td></tr><tr><td>To June 2019</td><td>356,000,000</td><td>231,793,087</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances is a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish it's enrolment policy.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of the Department.</p><p>Parents/guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.  Contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>The NCSE also works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at .</p><p>Where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. The availability of a school placement is assessed by the NCSE having regard to, although not limited to, the relevant diagnosis and relevant professional report.</p><p>Accordingly, the NCSE advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible. Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.</p><p>As the matter raised by the Deputy refers to a particular child, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the National Council for Special Education for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

The extra teachers in schools and improved staffing schedule measures have resulted in a continued reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) in schools with the primary PTR improving from 21.0:1 in 1998 to 15.1:1 in 2018 and post primary PTR improving from 15.0:1 to 12.7:1 over the same period.      </p>  <p>  In looking at the competing demands for the next Budget, I must have regard to the level of resources which will be available to my Department, in the context of the continuing need for the Government to prudently manage the economy and the public finances and have regard to risks, including those associated with Brexit.   </p>  <p>  The economic, fiscal and budgetary context for these decisions have been set out in the 2019 Summer Economic Statement, which was published on 25 June by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p>  <p>  It will be in that context that I will formulate specific budgetary priorities, having regard to the views of the education partners and all concerned stakeholders.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. </p>  <p>  My Department administers a grant aid scheme which can provide financial assistance to groups intending to establish a community-based CCTV system in their local areas. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  I would emphasise that grant funding can be considered only for proposed CCTV schemes which have obtained the necessary statutory approvals, as set out above.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department has to date not received any application for funding for community CCTV in the area referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of the grant aid scheme.  If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address communitycctv@justice.ie.</p></reply>

The Bureau draws together the necessary expertise from a number of Departments and agencies. </p><p>The Bureau maintains a presence in each of the Garda Divisions through the operation of the Divisional Assets Profiler Programme. Under this Programme, asset profilers are providing a criminal asset profiling service across the Garda Divisions in relation to persons or suspects operating within the area, with particular reference to those involved in serious and organised crime. The Bureau utilises the local knowledge supplied to it by the asset profilers, which enables it to target the proceeds of crime in local communities. A number of legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime, including the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016, which provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;; in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of.  </p><p>The following table represents the number of criminal asset profilers within the Kerry Division:<table><tr><th>Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Trained as Criminal Asset Profilers &ndash;   Kerry Division</th></tr><tr><td>Total Number Trained up to 31st December 2017 &ndash; 8</td></tr><tr><td>Total Number Trained up to 31st December 2018 &ndash; 9</td></tr><tr><td>Total Number Trained up to 2nd July   2019 &ndash; 9</td></tr></table></p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide significant additional policing hours throughout the country, both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties due to civilianisation of their current roles. These new resources coming on stream have allowed the Commissioner to allocate additional resources to the specialist bureaus that comprise Garda Special Crime Operations, including the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p></reply>

This marks the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date and is four times the size of the trade agreement with Japan.</p><p>Irish exporters have been subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions when exporting to Mercosur. This Agreement will see a significant reduction, or elimination, of tariffs and barriers to trade which will allow a cross flow of trading and investment between Ireland, the EU and the Mercosur region. The EU-Mercosur Agreement should make exports from Ireland more attractive, and potentially increase the demand for Irish products.</p><p>As with every Free Trade Agreement, Ireland &ndash; like all Member States &ndash; has defensive as well as offensive interests. The Agreement with Mercosur presents sectoral opportunities for Ireland in areas such as software and services in telecoms, financial services, digital content and travel, engineering products and services, life sciences, food and beverages, and education services.</p><p>On the other hand, I was always keenly aware of the potential impact that this Agreement presents to the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. Ireland, along with a number of other Member States, asserted early on in the negotiations that these agricultural sensitivities (and beef in particular) must be fully considered in the negotiations.</p><p>In this regard, Ireland has continually highlighted the cumulative impact of agricultural market access in relation to all EU trade agreements. My Department has done this through engagement with the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels, as well as joining with other Member States in formally writing to the Commission outlining our concerns. In addition, our concerns have been raised at political level &ndash; including myself and my officials raising the issues with counterparts, both at Trade Council deliberations and bilaterally with the EU Commission.</p><p>To that end, I wrote to the EU Trade Commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m as recently as 31<sup>st</sup>May this year to restate my views, which I had previously articulated at European Trade Council meetings, as well as directly with the Trade Commissioner, regarding the current challenges facing the beef sector.</p><p>I had sought assurances from the Commission that the final offer on beef &ndash; an offensive demand from the Mercosur side &ndash; would ensure that:</p><p>- the tariff rate quota for beef was low.</p><p>- that phasing-in periods were designed to allow sufficient time for Irish and EU industry to adjust,</p><p>- the Commission continually monitor quota levels taking into account domestic market conditions,</p><p>- the composition of beef imports from the region would be limited in relation to fresh chilled beef, and</p><p>- robust checks would be established and monitored at points of import to the EU to ensure animal health and welfare standards have been maintained.</p><p>As I am sure you are aware, An Taoiseach also recently wrote to the Commission to highlight our particular sensitivities in these negotiations. An Taoiseach joined the leaders of France, Poland and Belgium on 17<sup>th</sup>June, in writing to Commission President Juncker expressing our concerns on the inclusion of sensitive agricultural products in the negotiations, and stating that the current quotas for such products must not be increased.</p><p>It is disappointing that the agreement reached on beef access is more than we would have wished.  Although the quota of 99,000 tonnes is far less than the Mercosur countries were looking for. Also, the Agreement ensures an extended lead-in period before the full &ldquo;TRQ&rdquo; takes effect and that five-year period will only commence after the legal text of the Agreement is finalised and &ldquo;legally scrubbed&rdquo;, such that the full TRQ for beef will not take effect for some 7/8 years from now. The Government&rsquo;s active campaign, together with some other Member States, to secure the viability of the Irish and EU beef sector, has been a key component in achieving these ameliorating elements to this particular TRQ for beef.</p><p>Despite our strenuous efforts, we obviously are disappointed in relation to beef. However, it&rsquo;s important also to recognise the positive aspects to the deal as I&rsquo;ve outlined earlier. In terms of Agriculture, it is important to note that the dairy sector will benefit from the removal of tariffs on cheese, milk powder and infant formula. There are also benefits for the drinks industry. </p><p>We now intend to carry out a comprehensive economic assessment of the deal to see what impact it&rsquo;ll have on the Irish economy and on jobs and that will inform future actions.</p></reply>

I have met and spoken with many of the women involved, including at a meeting in January 2019, at which I apologised for how women and families were treated, as well as thanking them for sharing their views and experiences. The National Cancer Screening Service wrote last year to each woman affected, or their next of kin, apologising for the failures in relation to disclosure and setting out the actions being taken by the HSE to address the issues identified. The former Director General of the HSE, and the former head of Cervical Check have also apologised personally to individual women when the opportunity has arisen. Last year, Cervical Check placed advertisements with national media outlets apologising for how standards fell short in relation to this issue. </p><p>  It is also very important to note the actions taken by the State to address the issues identified in the Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Scally. Government has accepted in full the recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry and work is ongoing to implement these in full. In relation to the women concerned I am pleased that the Ex-Gratia Scheme has made its first payments in relation to the non-disclosure of audit results, and I understand that the panel will meet again shortly to consider further payments</p></reply>

Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have also been introduced. There has also been a significant expansion in the number of places on GP training programmes in recent years; up from 120 places in 2009 to 183 filled in 2019.</p>  <p>  An agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on contractual reform has been recently concluded. In return for cooperation with a wide range of service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (or &euro;210 million) over the 2019-2023 period.</p>  <p>  This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease management programme. There will also be increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas. Improvements in the maternity and paternity leave arrangements have also been agreed, in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments.</p></reply>

The responses to that consultation and other possible policy levers are being considered by my Department, with a view to developing a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy statement..</p><p>  At an operational level, the HSE's Acute Hospitals Drugs Management Programme has a biosimilar strategy in place since 2017, which is making considerable progress using a collaborative approach with hospital pharmacists and clinical teams to bring about changes in prescribing practice. In that respect, hospitals are working towards a targeted minimum prescribing rate for biosimilars of 50%.</p><p>The HSE is also working on identifying barriers to the prescribing of biosimilars, with a specific focus on education and support. It is seeking to increase understanding of biosimilars through targeted presentations to clinicians and hospitals. </p><p>The objective of these initiatives is a greater uptake in the use of biosimilars and this is evident by hospital dispensing data. For example, the prescribing rate for the biosimilar drug Infliximab has increased from 5% in 2017 to 40% in 2018. I am informed that, since the introduction of the Medicines Management Programme's biosimilar guidelines on 1 June 2019, more than 100 patients have already moved to biosimilar medicines.</p><p>My Department proposes to build on these positive developments and to bring forward a policy statement that would support and complement the many initiatives which are already underway.</p></reply>

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. As Minister, I have no role in this statutory process. </p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, including on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro, ongoing investments. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  In regard to new treatments for multiple sclerosis, I wish to advise you that the NCPE completed a health technology assessment in August 2018 on ocrelizumab for adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The NCPE recommended that ocrelizumab not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  In addition, in October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment of ocrelizumab for adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis and did not recommend that it be reimbursed for this indication.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that there has been considerable engagement with the applicant and commercial discussions are ongoing. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the statutory criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also commissioned an HTA for Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD). This is indicated for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis, who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity-related symptoms during an initial trial. The NCPE is currently awaiting information from the applicant for the HTA.</p></reply>

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year.  The Joint Committee intends to report thereon before the summer recess and the recommendations in its report will be considered during the ongoing process of drafting this Bill in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  Interlinked with the legislation, officials in my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, are developing a model of care for infertility and an associated public fund for AHR. This work includes developing proposals on the allocation of the &euro;1 million fund for use in relation to providing public AHR treatment which was announced in December 2018.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, options in relation to the parameters of any potential public funding model, including what eligibility criteria may be included, are still under consideration, and an announcement will be forthcoming once the relevant decisions have been finalised.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish Public Health Service there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  Overall, the development of a model of care for infertility will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p></reply>

The GDPR is a &lsquo;principles-based&rsquo; piece of legislation that sets out certain high-level rules, consisting of limitations and obligations, addressed to those who process personal data (data controllers). At the same time, it also gives individuals whose personal data are processed (data subjects) a range of rights to help them control how their personal data is used and ensure that these uses are both lawful and transparent.</p>  <p>  Confusion can arise in some instances, primarily where data controllers do not fully understand the GDPR or have been given incorrect advice.  In the circumstances identified by the Deputy, there is clearly a need to first analyse whether, in fact, there is a legal impediment under the GDPR to the activities in question.

The ICC has assured my Department that it has extensive systems and practices in place to underpin the welfare of hares and greyhounds involved in coursing and also that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards of welfare are adhered to.</p>  <p>  Coursing operates in a highly regulated environment coupled with a comprehensive set of rules directly applied by the ICC. It operates under a licence from the Minister of Culture, Heritage &amp;amp; the Gaeltacht, issued annually with a total of 26 conditions. These include a variety of measures, including a requirement that a qualified veterinarian attends at all coursing meetings to report on the health of the hares, a prohibition on the coursing of hares more than once in the same day, a prohibition on the coursing of sick or pregnant hares and a requirement that hares be released back into the wild during daylight hours.</p>  <p>  The ICC undertakes a range of actions to address issues related to health and welfare. Coursing clubs are required to comply fully with directives, instructions and guidance notes issued by the ICC in all matters relating to the capture, keeping in captivity, tagging, marking, coursing and release of hares, and the muzzling of greyhounds.</p>  <p>  A monitoring committee on coursing is in place, comprising officials from my Department, the ICC and the National Parks and Wildlife Services (NPWS), to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of both hares and greyhounds.</p>  <p>  The committee meets after each coursing season to review the outcome of all coursing meetings, having particular regard to hare and greyhound welfare.   </p>  <p>  I believe that it is critically important that those involved in coursing operate in accordance with the regulatory framework and that the welfare of both hares and greyhounds is at the forefront at all times.

There was a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices lasting from autumn 2018 to spring 2019, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p><p>The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission. </p><p>The submission made by my Department to the EU Commission in request of the aid package is available on my Department&rsquo;s website: </p><p>This exceptional aid has been granted by the European Commission on the basis that the Irish beef sector is heavily reliant on export markets, and is uniquely exposed to shifts in the UK market in particular.Additionally, Ireland&rsquo;s extensive beef system with its comparatively long production cycle presents challenges in responding to market shifts.  The Commission has also recognised that it is in the interests of the market stability of EU beef sector to avoid a situation where downward price pressure on Irish beef spills over to other Member States.  </p><p>This temporary exceptional aid provision is given effect through a Commission Implementing Regulation.  This regulation, the draft of which is available on the Commission's website, will be published soon.  </p><p>Article 1.3 of the implementing regulation provides as follows:</p><p>The measures taken by Ireland shall be aimed at reducing production or restructuring the beef and veal sector and one or more of the following objectives:</p><p>(a)implementation of quality schemes in the beef and veal sector or projects aiming at promoting quality and value added;</p><p>(b)boosting market diversification;</p><p>(c)protecting and improving the farmers&rsquo; environmental, climate and economic sustainability.</p><p>Ireland must now notify the Commission, no later than 31 July 2019, of the measures to be taken in accordance with the Regulation.  My Department is currently working on the detailed parameters of an exceptional aid scheme, in cooperation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the European Commission.  </p><p>Further details on the aid scheme will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p></reply>

The Commission are also bound by Article 33 of the same regulation regarding the management of stocks of common interest with third countries such as Norway.  This article states that the '<i>Union shall engage with those third countries with a view to ensuring that those stocks are managed in sustainable manner that is consistent with ...the objective laid down in Article 2(2).</i>It is that article which contains the objective of reaching the maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate by 2020.</p></reply>

There was a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices lasting from autumn 2018 to spring 2019, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission.</p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. Building on this is the exchequer funded Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million pilot project for 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP, and through the next Agri Food strategy to 2030. My view is that such measures should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.  </p></reply>

The Paris agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which will increase in ambition over time. The agreement means that the EU has a target of a 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Paris Agreement will be via the NDC proposed by the EU on behalf of its Member States.</p>  <p>  The Effort Sharing Regulation proposal suggested a 39% GHG reduction target for Ireland for the period 2021 to 2030 relative to 2005, again based on GDP per capita. However, this emissions target was adjusted downward for cost-effectiveness, by 9%, so the national target is 30% by 2030.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also been offered flexible mechanisms including 5.6% to be achieved via offsetting emissions by sequestering carbon dioxide through Land Use, Land use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) This constitutes the highest level of flexibility available to any member state. It was recognised that Ireland had two specific difficulties in reaching targets by emissions reduction alone and therefore has a higher level of flexibilities than those for other EU member states;</p>  <p>  1. The ratio of Ireland&rsquo;s non-Emission trading sector (including agriculture); Emission Trading Sector (principally heavy industry) emissions is higher than in most member states; </p>  <p>  2. The high proportion of agricultural emissions with low mitigation potential in total Irish GHG emissions.</p>  <p>  While Ireland is internationally recognised as having one of the most carbon efficient systems of food production in the EU, and when compared to other EU countries, there is huge variability in carbon efficiency that exists within the country. The Teagasc Sustainability Survey shows that the top performing third of farms emitted, on average, 9.6 kg CO2 equivalent per kg beef, compared with 14.9 kg for the bottom performing third of cattle farms. Reducing this variability is a real opportunity to make progress in reducing emissions from cattle production in Ireland with positive economic dividend on the farms concerned.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the agriculture sector as a whole will contribute significantly to achieving  Ireland&rsquo;s targets and its transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and society with collaboration, co-operation and collective responsibility being key in achieving this ambition.</p></reply>

Under current rules agreed as part of the EU Effort Sharing Regulation, forestry can contribute some 2.1 million tonnes of CO2 per annum of carbon towards Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets under the next climate mitigation period 2021-2030.</p>  <p>  Planting achieved under successive afforestation programmes will be the basis for this emissions reductions figure.  The Climate Action Plan now sets a target of an average of 8,000 hectares of new planting per year.  While this will mostly yield benefits in the longer term post-2030, it will also contribute to our 2030 target through carbon sequestration.</p>  <p>  My Department has approved an average of 9,000 hectares for new planting each year for the last three years. This means that there are almost 10,000 approved and shovel-ready hectares available to the forestry sector which could be planted today.  The challenge is to ensure that all of the effort that goes into securing and approving new sites results in those sites being planted, if planting levels are to increase and the target of 18% land cover is to be achieved.  I am committed to working towards this target through the continued provision of generous grants and premiums, engagement with a range of stakeholders from farmers to public bodies, a dedicated promotion and communication campaign, and by examining ways in which farm forestry can be better integrated into the new CAP.  Knowledge transfer programmes and other initiatives which raise awareness of the economic and ecosystem benefits of forestry will continue to play an important role in tackling some of the barriers to planting.</p></reply>

My Department plays a part in the enforcement of this legislation along with other Government departments and State Agencies such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and the Health Service Executive. The FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.</p>  <p>  Labelling of food is governed by the EU food legislation on the provision of Food Information to Consumers (Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011), which lays down strict rules on labelling of ingredients. Country of origin labelling is mandatory for certain meats and other products such as honey and wine. From 1 April 2020, it will be mandatory to indicate the country of origin of the primary ingredient (which makes up more than 50% of a food) if it is different from the country of origin of the product as a whole.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.</p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all of its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.</p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.  These checks include physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.</p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by my Department ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products.</p>  <p>  The FSAI has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation, in these establishments.  The FSAI reports in detail on the number of inspections and checks carried out, and non-compliance findings.</p></reply>

In 2018, Ireland exported dairy products to approximately 140 countries totalling over &euro;4.5 billion worth of produce, an increase of over 5% by volume compared to 2017.</p>  <p>  Opening new markets and expanding existing ones is a key part of my Department's response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and is in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.</p>  <p>  My Department's market access web portal, launched earlier this year, provides a wide range of information to exporters in relation to markets and requirements. The inaugural market access report, launched on 4 March 2019,  provides an overview of the substantial progress made in terms of market access to third countries for Irish food producers.</p>  <p>  Bord Bia have undertaken a major data driven exercise to identify priority markets across the food and drink categories, which can be targeted. This exercise is providing an invaluable tool for Irish exporters and for the department and its agencies in determining the strategic priorities for agri-food trade. In relation to meat, five countries have been selected for detailed study - Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico &amp;amp; Malaysia -  and for dairy, the following countries have been identified - Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia &amp;amp; Vietnam</p>  <p>  The role of my Department is to open up markets for the industry and it is then up to the industry, with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to avail of these opportunities. </p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of global meat and dairy markets are strong, with growing global demand projected from fast developing countries with increasing middle classes and more westernised diets. There is confidence that the Irish food industry is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by this expanding global demand, underpinned by the success of our efforts and those of the Irish food industry.</p></reply>

These include: </p>  <p>  - the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme for Brexit-impacted SMEs and mid-cap businesses. The funding arrangements ensure that at least 40% of the fund is available to food businesses. Up to 14 June 2019, 585 applications have been approved.  The total number of loans progressed to sanction at bank level is 141, with a total value of &euro;30.6m, of which 29, with a value of &euro;8.2m, relate to food businesses;  </p>  <p>  - a market prioritisation exercise undertaken by Bord Bia to identify priority markets across all food and drinks categories; </p>  <p>  - tailored supports and analysis are being provided to food companies through Bord Bia&rsquo;s Brexit Barometer;</p>  <p>  - an intensified series of trade missions to develop and grow new markets;</p>  <p>  -  the recently launched DBEI/DAFM &ldquo;Future Growth Loan Scheme&rdquo; will bring up to &euro;300 million of long-term strategic investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors.  The fund is leveraged by exchequer funding of &euro;62 million, of which 40%, or some &euro;25 million, has been provided by my Department.  Businesses have been able to apply for loan eligibility through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) since 17th April 2019.</p>  <p>  I also have had ongoing discussions with Commissioner Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit. The Commission have already made &euro;50m available to Irish beef farmers as a response to market pressures, and this can be matched by national funding. I expect to be rolling out a support scheme with this funding in the very near future.  I have also stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a further range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agri-food and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>  And, of course, our practical preparations for all potential scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit, continue to be progressed and refined through the whole-of-Government coordination structures that have been in place for some time.</p></reply>

The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  To achieve this, the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks by 2020 at the latest. This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.</p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2018, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. From the 74 stocks, 32 are assessed as being sustainably fished in 2018. This number has grown every year since 2013. This in turn leads to the number of stocks being over fished declining from 22 in 2014 to 16 in 2018.</p>  <p>  The 2018 December Fisheries Council, at which quotas for 2019 were agreed on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice, showed a rebuilding of many stocks. I was pleased that the scientific advice supported large increases in a number of stocks of importance such as Haddock (+20%), Hake (+28%) and Megrims (+47%) in the Celtic Sea. The overall increase of 30% in whitefish quota will provide improved fishing opportunities for whitefish fishermen all around our coasts. This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservation measures are paying off.</p>  <p>  I am confident that, through the CFP, we will be able to ensure the sustainability of our fish stocks and in turn the economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors, thereby supporting the families and communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.</p></reply>

It has become even more important in recent times given the need to diversify our markets and reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.</p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of EU-agreed trade deals with Canada, Japan and Mexico, my Department will continue its efforts to open new markets while further deepening trade with existing markets for Irish agri-food exporters. </p>  <p>  For example, in 2018, it facilitated the decision of the Chinese authorities to open their market to Irish beef imports by listing a number of approved Irish beef establishments. Other notable achievements during 2018 were agreements with Qatar and Kuwait which allowed for the importation of Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry to their markets.  In April 2019, we saw the opening of the Ukrainian market for Irish beef and pork. During my June trade mission to Japan, an agreement was reached in principle to allow access for Irish sheepmeat. This development followed the announcement last month of the removal of the under-30 months restriction for Irish beef exports to Japan. This means that all Irish beef is now eligible for export to this very valuable market.</p>  <p>  Trade Missions also play an important role in this regard, building a network of Governmental, Official and Industry contacts which assist in gaining and then developing a presence in many global markets. In 2018, I led successful missions to the US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>  <p>  In 2019, an extensive trade mission itinerary is being pursued. So far this year, I have visited Turkey and China followed by an extensive mission to Japan and South Korea in June.  My next scheduled trade mission is to Algeria and Egypt in November. These missions include participants from across the agri-food sector and feature extensive interactions between industry and officials with their counterparts as well as high-level political discussions.</p>  <p>  Overall, agri-food exports to countries outside the EU have increased from around &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;3.6 billion in the period 2014 to 2018. This represents very rapid growth of 36% in that four-year timeframe.</p></reply>

These statistics are reported on by the CSO in various publications and are available on their website. Departmental publications such as the Annual Review and Outlook 2018 also report on the costs of farm inputs. Farm output costs, input costs and margins also receive detailed examination each year by Teagasc in their National Farm Survey. International sources used to monitor farm inputs include, Eurostat, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and OECD.</p>  <p>  In June 2019, the CSO released its Final Estimate of Output, Input and Income in Agriculture for 2018. This shows that aggregate farm income (operating surplus) decreased by 17% to &euro;2,849 million in 2018. However, this follows an increase of 30% in 2017 against 2016 figures. The overall value of goods output increased by 1.2%, or &euro;96m, to &euro;8,182m. Intermediate consumption increased by &euro;690 million (13%) over 2017, to &euro;6,001 million.  The main items giving rise to this increase are feeding stuffs and fertilisers, which increased by &euro;356 million (+27%) and &euro;69 million (+13%) respectively.</p>  <p>  Each month, the CSO issue the Agricultural Price Indices outlining the changes in output and input indices for a range of agricultural products. In their most recent release issued in mid-June covering the period up to April 2019, the CSO indicated that the agricultural output price index increased by 0.3% in April 2019 compared with March 2019. On an annual basis, the agricultural output price index was up 0.9% in April 2019 compared with April 2018. The agricultural input price index increased by 0.1% in April 2019 compared with March 2019. The resulting terms of trade index for the month increased by 0.3% in April 2019. On an annual basis, the agricultural input price index increased by 4.9% in April 2019 compared with April 2018.</p></reply>

The latest data available shows that these targets have been met. There has been growth of 50% for primary production and 49% for exports (based on 2018 data), and 47% for value-added (latest available data 2016).</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025, the latest ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July 2015, is the successor to the Food Harvest strategy. It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to develop and prosper. Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believed that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion. With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.</p>  <p>  In July 2018, I launched the third annual progress report of Food Wise 2025, Steps to Success 2018. This showed that by 2017 exports had increased by 15.9% and primary production by 8.9% compared to the baseline.</p>  <p>  As of Q1 2019, of the 376 detailed actions which were due to commence by 2019 or are ongoing actions;  81% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 19% have commenced and are progressing well.</p></reply>

In 1996, there were approximately 500 deer farms with 20,000 deer in Ireland, but numbers have declined sharply since that time.</p>  <p>  Today, there are only a small number of farmers in Ireland actively supplying deer for meat production, which cater primarily to specialised niche markets. The sector is reliant upon producers and companies ensuring that a market exists for their product, an objective which Bord Bia assists in by identifying and developing potential market outlets.</p>  <p>  Growth in the past was achieved as a result of improved distribution for game meats, especially in supermarkets. Game and exotic meats historically occupy a premium, niche segment of the meat market. Whilst there are opportunities to compete with the larger premium segment of the red meat/poultry categories, it is important to note that demand is seasonal, with the greatest concentration of retail shelf space dedicated to game in the Winter/Christmas period.</p>  <p>  My Department has approved one factory for the slaughter of deer in Ireland, and two game-handling plants. There may also be outlets for processing of venison in Local Authority approved plants, but this would be a matter for the Local Authority concerned.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-03a.541.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070300086#WRM01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 to 285, inclusive, together.</p><p>The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) is a non-commercial State body under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for the maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic oil reserves. NORA is funded through a levy placed on the sale of most oil products. The current rate of the NORA levy is 2 cent per litre, having been set at this rate in 2009. Oil Companies are liable for payment of this levy when oil is placed on the market. However, I understand that the levy is passed on to consumers, both retail and commercial, when purchasing oil. The annual revenue from the NORA levy from 2007 to 2018 was as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Annual Revenue</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;134,185,000</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;130,410,000</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;131,766,000</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;130,380,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;121,337,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;123,420,257</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;122,755,088</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;129,664,352</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;139,711,142</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;93,327,372</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>&euro;81,367,837</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>&euro;46,708,092</td></tr></table></p><p>NORA levy monies are paid directly by the oil companies to NORA and not to the Exchequer. </p><p>Prior to 2009, the NORA levy was 1c per litre of product. This was not sufficient to meet NORA&rsquo;s expenses, including the purchase of oil stocks for use in an emergency, and a very considerable level of borrowing had built up. The levy was increased from 1 cent to 2 cent in 2009, primarily to manage and repay this debt, but also to build up stocks and secure additional storage, both within Ireland and abroad, to ensure Ireland held its 90-day obligation in physical stocks. </p><p>By April 2017 NORA had repaid all its outstanding debt obligations (&euro;444m in 2009) and now meets Ireland&rsquo;s oil stockholding obligations fully with physical stock. NORA was debt free throughout 2018. </p><p>The company&rsquo;s closing cash balance at 31st December 2018 was &euro;183.9m. This will be used for:</p><p>a) NORA&rsquo;s ongoing financing requirements and commitments;</p><p>b) the purchase of additional oil stocks associated with planned changes in storage contract arrangements, including stock to be purchased in 2020 and held at the ESB-owned oil storage site at Poolbeg, which has been refurbished by NORA.</p><p>Government approved the establishment of the Climate Action Fund (CAF), to be funded by the excess of receipts over costs from the NORA levy, to support projects that will help towards reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative proposals are currently being designed for the repurposing of the NORA levy to include meeting NORA&rsquo;s expenses, and to provide future financing to the CAF. As NORA levy funding is not paid to the Exchequer, the repurposing of a portion of this funding for the CAF will have no impact on the Exchequer.</p></reply>

These details include the following: in 1996 20% of Telecom &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s shares were sold as part of a strategic alliance with Comsource an entity owned by KPN Telecom BV of the Netherlands (60%) and Telia AB of Sweden (40%). An additional 15% of shares were acquired by this entity along with the transfer of 14.9% of the shares to employees before the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Telecom &Eacute;ireann shares in 1999.

Proper segregation of waste is crucial. It minimises the amount of waste ending up in landfill and helps us use our resources more effectively. The three new labels are voluntary for use by producers, manufacturers and retailers. The labels clearly identify whether an item is widely recycled, whether it is not recyclable, and whether more information should be sought before deciding how to dispose of it. This is just one of a number of initiatives to help people to recycle, including the development of a single nationwide list of recyclable materials which may be placed in the household recycling bin, and the launch of the website mywaste.ie to advise householders on all aspects of how to prevent and manage their waste.   These new labels, which have been developed in partnership with the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices, will clearly show when to recycle or dispose of an item and I encourage all retailers, manufacturers and producers to take up this useful initiative.</p>  <p>  Major retailers have expressed interest in the new labelling system, and it is being rolled out free of charge to producers, manufacturers and retailers. More information about the labels and how to apply is available on mywaste.ie.</p>  <p>  Subscription to the scheme has been kept as voluntary because the European Commission has warned of the risk of market fragmentation when Member States take measures in an uncoordinated manner, which differ in scope, focus and ambition level. This can lead to a variety of restrictions of market access among Member States, barriers to the free movement of goods and to the level playing field between producers in different countries.</p></reply>

It may also support innovative interventions in these sectors. </p>  <p>  In November 2018, I announced seven successful projects from the first Call for Applications under the Climate Action Fund. Up to &euro;77m in grant aid will be provided to these projects leveraging a total investment, including grant aid, of &euro;300m. Effectively the Fund is leveraging &euro;3 for every &euro;1 it provides.</p>  <p>  As the support provided to these projects is in the form of grant aid, as opposed to a financial investment that will be repaid, these is no associated rate of return for the Climate Action Fund.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Fund will provide &euro;500 million support to projects over the period of the National Development Plan. The sources of funding include the use of unspent monies in the Energy Efficiency Fund and the excess of receipts over costs from the existing petroleum products levy (commonly called the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) levy). </p>  <p>  There is a total of &euro;15 million funding from the Energy Efficiency Fund which is available for use from 2019. The annual contributions to the fund from the NORA levy are projected to be circa &euro;60 million on average per annum from 2020. The exact level of funding in each year has yet to be determined. Legislative proposals are currently being designed for the repurposing of the NORA levy to include meeting NORA&rsquo;s expenses, and to provide future financing to the Climate Action Fund.</p></reply>

In particular I see opportunities for industry and consumers to respond and make positive changes to how we use plastic and other packaging.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2019 has ten dedicated actions which focus on waste and the Circular Economy. Our focus will be on designing out waste, prioritising prevention of waste at every opportunity through eco-design, reuse and repair, market restriction and levies. </p><p>Ireland is working closely with other Member States in the European Union. We are working on the development of policy instruments which shall include:</p><p>- Regulatory changes;</p><p>- Market incentives;</p><p>- Promotion, labelling and the provision of information on sustainable practices;</p><p>- Developmental work with the sector to improve our capacity to deliver our goals.</p><p>Included in the regulatory changes will be the amended Waste Framework Directive which promotes the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) model and aims to make it more effective through minimum common requirements. </p><p>As part of the Climate Action Plan, we will identify opportunities to strengthen the regulatory and enforcement frameworks and structures for the waste collection and management system, to maximise the collection of clean, segregated materials for reuse and/or recycling from all households and businesses, and to incentivise consumers to reduce, reuse and recycle. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan also commits to regulating and incentivising producers of waste, particularly packaging, to ensure the prevention of waste and the use of recycled materials in packaging product. The Plan states that the following steps will be necessary to deliver this action:</p><p>- Q3 2019: Pilot eco-modulation fees for packaging</p><p>- Q2 2020: New Packaging Waste Directive transposition</p><p>- Q1 2021: Implementation of full eco-modulated fees for packaging</p><p>A core opportunity for improving EPR measures is to develop economic incentives which favour circular products and business models. </p><p>Ahead of this, Repak members are taking steps to prevent and minimise the amount of packaging they require. With the assistance of the EPA, Repak&rsquo;s Prevent and Save initiative has worked with Irish business to reduce packaging and to promote packaging improvements across industry. Under the initiative, specialist packaging technologists look for ways to optimise the packaging used and to minimise any resulting packaging waste. Further information can be found on www.repak.ie/preventandsave. However, it should also be noted that packaging is used by producers and retailers to protect and preserve goods and can help in preventing food and other product waste.</p><p>Under current Packaging Regulations, at least 60% of packaging waste must be recovered and 55% must be recycled. Repak is the approved producer responsibility compliance scheme for packaging in Ireland and it is tasked with meeting recovery and recycling targets established under the EU Packaging Directive. Repak recently confirmed that their members achieved an overall recycling rate of 68% for all materials and is ahead of the EU targets by 13%. Ireland&rsquo;s official statistics are compiled by the EPA and will be published shortly. It is anticipated they will show that Ireland has continued to meet and exceeded the overall packaging waste recovery rate and the recycling rate targets since they came into force. The task ahead of Ireland now is to meet the increased targets that will come into force under the CELP.</p></reply>

The Deputy correctly notes that diesel technology has become progressively cleaner and greener over the past decade with the introduction of each improving Euro-class standard. Euro VI-class engines demonstrably emit fewer harmful air pollutants such as NO<sub>X</sub>and PMs. Notwithstanding that progress, a transition away from the use of fossil fuels towards alternative fuels in the heavy-duty sector will be required in the coming years to reduce our growing freight emissions. </p><p>My Department is working closely with that of Minister Bruton to encourage this transition, and an interdepartmental Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Taskforce was jointly convened to consider the range of options available to Government to accelerate the take-up of low-carbon technologies. While electric technology in the heavy-duty sector is not as well developed as in the light-duty sector, this is rapidly changing as the market matures; large vehicles such as electric trucks have been sold in other jurisdictions, indicating that electricity may become a more feasible option for the heavy-duty sector in the longer term. Of course, electric vehicles are not the only alternative fuel or technology available to reduce transport emissions; the <i>National Policy Framework for Alternative Fuels Infrastructure in Ireland</i>, published by my Department in 2017, outlined a potential role for other fuels and technologies, including hydrogen, biofuels and natural gas/biogas. Phase 2 of the LEV Taskforce which is considering these alternative fuels, amongst others, is ongoing. It is expected that the Taskforce will submit recommendations in this regard to Government as part of the 2020 Budget and Estimates Process. The role of incentives, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</p><p>Over the coming years, further steps will be needed to help move towards decarbonisation of the freight sector and, more broadly, towards meeting our national emissions targets. The <i>Climate Action Plan</i>indicates potential pathways to achieving this. Action 83 of the Climate Action Plan indicates a commitment to consider the introduction of an emissions-based VRT and motor tax for light goods vehicles and heavy goods vehicles. The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for taxation, and consequently for implementation of this action, rests with the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

This Bill has been referred to Cabinet Committee for further consideration. Ongoing meetings of the database project board are being held to oversee the project&rsquo;s implementation. The Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) state that the current project focus is on privately insured vehicles, which represent 92% of insured vehicles. Fleet policies, which present many challenges as insurers do not currently successfully capture all of the required detailed data regarding vehicles and drivers in a timely way, will be addressed in a later project phase.</p><p>The key reasons for the lengthening of the timetable for delivery of the MTPL database are:</p><p>-Delivery has now been significantly expanded to cover details on all Private, Commercial and Fleet motor vehicle information </p><p>- Delivery of the capability to capture and validate driver number details will require both an initial industry-wide start date for the collection of data for new policies and an extended period to allow for driver number details to be collected on normal renewals.</p><p>- Before insurance companies can start requiring customers to supply both their driver number details and those of their named drivers on the policy, amendments to the Road Traffic Acts will need to be in place. </p><p>- Mechanisms will have to be developed and agreed between all insurers and DTTAS Shannon for them to gain access to the NVDF to validate driver numbers.</p><p>Insurance Ireland and all the insurance companies operating in Ireland, working together with DTTAS, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the MIBI, through the MTPL Insurance Database Project Board, have now structured the delivery of Phase 2 of the MTPL project into four sub-phases, namely:</p><blockquote>- Delivery of all information currently covered by section 78(a) of the Road Traffic Act(2016) for both private and commercial vehicles, by end 2019.<br /><br />- Delivery of driver number capture and validation capability, by end of 2019, subject to the necessary legislative amendments being passed.<br /><br />- Delivery of motor fleet information, by 2020.<br /><br />- Delivery of all driver numbers for all drivers (following the completion of the required renewal cycles), by 2021.</blockquote></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 948,000 customers with direct eligibility.  Following recent announcements in Budget 2019, the funding for the free travel scheme was increased by &euro;5 million to a total of &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance, blind pension and partial capacity benefit.  In 1997 the free travel pass was extended to all registered blind people regardless of whether they qualify for the Department's blind person's pension or any other Social Protection payment. Blind people remain one of the only cohorts of people aged under 66 who can qualify for a free travel pass while not in receipt of a qualifying Social Protection payment.</p>  <p>  Any possible extension to the eligibility criteria for free travel would have significant costs implications for the free travel scheme and would also require additional administrative processes to be put in place to adjudicate eligibility.  Any decision to do so could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), the Department of  Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 948,000 customers with direct eligibility.  Following recent announcements in Budget 2019, the funding for the free travel scheme was increased by &euro;5 million to a total of &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance, blind pension and partial capacity benefit.  In 1997 the free travel pass was extended to all registered blind people regardless of whether they qualify for the Department's blind person's pension or any other Social Protection payment.  Blind people remain one of the only cohorts of people aged under 66 who can qualify for a free travel pass while not in receipt of a qualifying Social Protection payment.</p>  <p>  Any possible extension to the eligibility criteria for free travel would have significant costs implications for the free travel scheme and would also require additional administrative processes to be put in place to adjudicate eligibility.  Any decision to do so could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Primary responsibility for the programme rests with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys T.D.</p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland addresses challenges to participation in the labour force by developing and implementing a range of new initiatives aimed at easing barriers to entry into the workforce including investment in Early Learning and Care, providing tailored activation and training supports and generating attractive employment opportunities including intelligent working arrangements. </p>  <p>  As the nature of work and society changes, the way we organise work must also.  One of the ambitions in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 is to foster participation in the labour market through flexible working solutions.  Flexible working solutions, including part-time, remote working, compressed hours, home-working and job sharing, are understood to have the potential to improve labour market participation, particularly amongst women with young children, as well as those with caring responsibilities, older people, and people with disabilities.  Flexible working can also provide solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so.</p>  <p>  Flexible work can assist in the development of an inclusive society by offering options to the benefit of employers, workers and wider society.  We already have many companies in Ireland who offer remote working to their employees and this trend is expected to increase in the future.  For workers, flexible work solutions such as remote working can mean substantial savings in terms of rents and property costs while also reducing the need to commute, leading to a better work-life balance.  For businesses, intelligent working arrangements can support staff retention, a more motivated workforce with fewer sick days, and greater productivity, as well as the opportunity to draw workers from a larger pool of talent. </p>  <p>  Under Future Jobs Ireland 2019, the Department of Justice and Equality will develop guidance to support employers in offering more family-friendly working options and promoting the adoption of flexible and or remote working solutions and structures for parents.  In addition to this, the Department of Justice and Equality will commence a national consultation on the extension of flexible working options to all employees.  The findings of the research and the outcome of the national consultation may lead to the development of further, new deliverables for inclusion in the next stage, Future Jobs Ireland 2020.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It is also necessary for the content of LAPs within the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) to be consistent with the transport strategy for the GDA.</p><p>In relation to the assessment of planning applications and/or appeals on planning decisions, local planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, the development plan, including any relevant local area plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial guidelines or Government policies.</p><p>I am satisfied that the compact urban growth objectives of the National Planning Framework are consistent with and supported by the Guidelines for Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas and that these policy and guidance documents provide a robust framework for decision making on planning applications in a variety of different contexts. </p><p>My Department will continue to engage with planning authorities, the home-building industry and other sectoral interests to address any issues arising, particularly in the context of the review of development plans and related guidance, that will follow the making of the three Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies by the Regional Assemblies as part of the implementation of the National Planning Framework throughout the planning system.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental purposes. Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the relevant local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB). As part of the agreement, the property owner then leases the dwelling to the local authority for use as social housing for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs but subject to a minimum of 5 years. RLS is not a grant scheme; the value of the repairs is offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. The RLS is available in all local authority areas. However, it is a condition of the scheme that the property is in an area with a social housing need and fulfils social housing demand.  </p><p>Property owners may also qualify for schemes such as the Better Energy Homes Scheme. The Better Energy Homes Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI) to help homeowners and landlords reduce their energy costs and emissions by providing grants towards insulation, heating control and solar thermal improvements on homes occupied and built before 2006.

Ireland has been a Party to the Convention since 8<sup>th</sup>January 2002.</p><p>Ireland does not have significant trade in ivory specimens and the domestic market allows only for trade in pre-Convention ivory. This trade consists primarily of carved artifacts, antique items and some musical instrument components and is governed by CITES. </p><p>Applications for CITES certificates or permits are examined carefully by the Irish CITES Management Authority in my Department to determine that the ivory has an attested legal origin. If the Management Authority is satisfied that the ivory has been legally acquired, it will then issue a certificate or permit to verify that fact in line with current CITES regulations.</p><p>The EU and its Member States have been at the forefront in the regulation of ivory trade and stringent rules are already in place cross the Union. While these have functioned effectively to date, the current EU ivory guidance document is in the process of being revised; it is envisaged that the guidance will incorporate stricter rules on trade in raw and worked ivory in the future. </p><p>As a Member State, Ireland participates in regular EU CITES Management Committee and CITES Scientific Group meetings and supports a common EU approach to CITES matters, including the ivory trade. The Irish authorities will continue to participate fully in discussions around this issue.</p></reply>

This year I have allocated &euro;1.824m and &euro;2.5m respectively to these schemes. Details of these projects and funding, and the criteria by which they are assessed, are available on my Department's website and local authority websites. Sligo County Council was allocated &euro;30,000 under the HSF and &euro;60,000 under the BHIS. While the closing dates for applications have now passed, my Department will remain in close contact with local authorities throughout the year to ensure the best possible use is made of all funds, including by reallocating funds where certain projects do not proceed within agreed timeframes.</p>  <p>  In the context of a particular building or historic structure, the best advice is generally to contact the Heritage Officer or Architectural Conservation Officer in the local authority who is well placed to advise on the various types of funding available to assist with its renovation or conservation.  The structure in question is also recorded on the Record of Monuments and Places (RMP) for County Sligo and my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service would be happy to provide any archaeological advice or guidance that might be of assistance.</p></reply>
