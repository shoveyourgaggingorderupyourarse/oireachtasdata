The City of Dublin Youth Services Board, and the HSE act as channels of funding for the administration of this funding to front line drug and alcohol projects. The Dept of Health has not suspended funding to any organisation providing drug and alcohol services under the remit of the North Inner City Drugs and Alcohol Task Force.</p>  <p>  The task force has informed local services that it is no longer in a position to function. The Department has asked the HSE (CHO Dublin North City and County) and the City of Dublin Youth Services Board, to provide reassurance to the frontline services that funding will continue in 2022. </p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE has met with each of the funded organisations over the past three weeks as part of the annual Service Level/Grant Aid Agreement process and has not been made aware of any reduction, interruption in or impact to service delivery.</p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE met with the company associated with the North Inner City Drugs and Alcohol Task Force on 13th January in relation to service delivery issues, including the parameters of funding in 2022 that could be provided to the company. I would advise the company to engage directly with the HSE to discuss its proposed programme of drug and alcohol activities in 2022.  </p></reply>

Last week the Government announced a further reduction to &euro;80 which will be effective from 1 March this year. </p><p>The combined effect of those two reductions in the DPS threshold will be an annual saving of &euro;408, or 30%, for any individual or household that regularly exceeded the 2021 threshold of &euro;114.</p><p>Budget 2022 also included provision for the expansion of free GP care to all children aged 6 and 7. My officials and the HSE are already engaged in preparatory work, and I expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the IMO later this quarter.  </p><p>A sum of &euro;10 million was provided on top of the 2022 Estimate allocation of &euro;56 million to improve the viability and sustainability of the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS). </p><p>Funding of &euro;4.5m has been provided for measures to alleviate the financial burden associated with hospital charges for children accessing care in a public hospital.

My Department, and the HSE, continue to review new evidence, research and data as it emerges, internationally and nationally, to ensure care is in place for all adults and children who need it.</p><p>As of midnight 8th Feb, 1,745 children with a confirmed case of COVID19 have been recorded on the national Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting system as having been hospitalised since the start of the pandemic.  <i>However, </i>it would not be accurate to say definitively that this is the number of children hospitalised <i>due to COVID19</i>&ndash; some may have been admitted to hospital for conditions other than COVID19. </p><p>Fortunately, most children with COVID19 infection have asymptomatic or mild disease. The incidence of severe disease and hospitalisation of children with COVID19 is low. The international evidence to date is that the incidence of Long COVID in children is rare and mainly of short duration. </p><p>The HSE has developed an interim model of care for Long Covid and this includes paediatrics. I am informed by the HSE that they are establishing post-acute and Long Covid services across the country and that they will continue to monitor cases of COVID19 to assess and plan for associated needs. </p><p>People who have had Covid-19 and are in need of further care are being followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate. Adults and children with concerns regarding Long COVID are advised to consult with their GP in the first instance. </p></reply>

I am anxious to assure thalidomide survivors of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to provide them with the necessary health supports to meet their related needs. I have directed my office to set up a meeting with thalidomide survivors at the end of this month, strictly without prejudice to the ongoing litigation. </p>  <p>  In addition to an ex-gratia lump sum and an ex-gratia monthly allowance for life, the supports provided by the Irish State to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means.  This includes access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment and housing adaptations.  </p>  <p>  There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive who liaises with Irish thalidomide survivors and assists them to access supports towards their ongoing health and personal social service needs.</p>  <p>  At the meeting with survivors I will listen to their healthcare needs.  I will also talk with them about the work underway in the Department to provide these health and personal social supports on an ex-gratia basis on a statutory footing, as committed to by the Government.  However, as outlined above, matters which are before the High Court will not form part of the agenda for discussion.</p></reply>

Importantly and distinctly from other workers, those eligible are, in general, frontline public sector healthcare workers who are directly employed and worked or trained in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments / clinical settings.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I note that the Deputy has asked about two particular organisations - my Department is working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply.</p>  <p>I am mindful of other workers outside of frontline healthcare who played their own important part during this difficult period but did not work in such exposed areas. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the specific additional risks which these frontline healthcare workers faced.  </p></reply>

Although the NIRP is part of the HSE, it is independent of all HSE operations at both national and community level.  </p>  <p>  Since 2018 the NIRP have received four referrals.  One in 2018, one in 2019, and two in 2020.  </p>  <p>  As per the NIRP&rsquo;s Operational Guidelines 2021, all reports produced by the NIRP will be pseudonymised with all identifying information removed. In this context the NIRP cannot identify the CHO area that each review pertains to, nor can it identify whether the reviews pertain to a HSE or HSE funded service.</p>  <p>  The NIRP will seek to determine what the relevant services and individuals involved in the case might have done differently that could have prevented the significant harm or improved the quality of life for the person/s concerned. It is important to remember, therefore, that the aim of the NIRP review process is to promote learning from cases where there have been extreme concerns about the safety and wellbeing of individuals who use a community health and social care service within a HSE or HSE funded service.  </p></reply>

The plan provides for progression of projects across sector and across the country.</p><p>In developing the Plan, the number of projects competing for inclusion invariably exceeds the funding available. It is therefore necessary to carry out a robust appraisal and then prioritisation exercise to ensure that best value is achieved from the available capital budget. This is in line with the Public Spending Code requirements.</p><p>In the conduct of initial appraisal of proposed projects, submissions must be considered by the HSE&rsquo;s National Capital &amp;amp; Property Steering Committee. If a project submission is approved by this Committee, it can then be included for consideration for inclusion in the Capital Plan.</p><p>Regarding these projects, submissions have been made and are being considered by the National Capital &amp;amp; Property Steering Committee. A site inspection and meeting was to be organised, however due to COVID -19 this was not possible. An on-site meeting has been arranged between the Services, Estates and local Community Healthcare Organisation to review these projects on the 16<sup>th</sup>February 2022.</p></reply>

In that regard, I note that the number of GPs contracted to provide services to GMS patients has increased in the past 10 years from 2,258 to 2,539, an increase of 12%.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am very aware of the workforce issues facing general practice, including changing demographics, the number of GPs nearing retirement, the difficulties in filling a small number of GMS vacancies, and the impact of the shift towards care centred in the community on general practice.  The Government has committed to providing significant additional resources to general practice to help to meet those challenges.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement with GPs will see investment in general practice increase by approximately 40%, or &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented.  We are on schedule in the delivery of those resources, with an increase of funding of &euro;143.6 million provided between 2019 and 2021, and an additional &euro;63 million provided in Budget 2022.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. The Agreement also provides for increased support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements. </p>  <p>  Previously, changes were made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible GMS GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, while enhanced supports for rural GP practices were introduced, and since increased by the 2019 GP Agreement, to support rural GPs and make rural GMS panels more attractive. </p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily in recent years from 120 in 2009 to 233 trainees enrolled in 2021. Further increases are expected following the transfer of responsibility for training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners.  </p>  <p>  The vital role played by general practice and GPs individually throughout the COVID crisis is acknowledged. General practice has continued to operate, providing both Covid and non-Covid care to their patients. In return, the Government has provided substantial additional payments of over &euro;300 million to general practice to enable GPs to provide: consultation services; assessments and referrals for Covid tests; Covid respiratory clinics; and Covid vaccinations. This is a demonstration of what general practice can do when properly resourced and is a positive indicator for the future.</p></reply>

This policy supports the reconfiguration of children&rsquo;s disability services to provide equitable, child and family centred services based on need rather than diagnosis. The PDS programme will ensure that services are provided for children with complex needs regardless of where they live or where they go to school and to facilitate this Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams (CDNTs) have been established to provide services and supports for all children with complex needs with all 91 CDNTs established by December 2021. </p>  <p>  As part of the HSE National Service Plan 2021, a total of 100 development posts were allocated for PDS and its implementation, from which Cork/Kerry Community Healthcare were allocated 7.5 additional posts. A further additional 5.8 posts were allocated under the Special School allocation. </p>  <p>  At the end of December 2021, 6 additional posts from a total of 13.3 had been filled and HSE advise that efforts are ongoing to fill the remaining positions.  Further additional posts for all CDNTs will also be announced as part of the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2022 to provide additional supports and therapy services for children throughout the country.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are a number of vacancies in Network Teams in the Cork area, primarily due to difficulty with recruitment. This difficulty is being experienced in the majority of teams across the country. HSE Disability Services advise the backfilling of posts is challenging in the current environment due to lack of availability of appropriately qualified staff and demand for same across the health service. However, the Lead Agencies responsible for the management of the teams are prioritising the recruitment of such posts. </p>  <p>  While efforts continue to ensure posts are filled as quickly as possible, the HSE advise that Network Teams in Cork operate according to a suite of national and regional standard operating policies, procedures and guidelines. There are prioritisation systems and caseload management systems (including assessment and intervention pathways) in place. This means that in practice children with the highest priority of need will have access to services in the first instance, while children with a lower priority of need are placed on the appropriate waitlists. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the caseload management systems are reviewed and updated regularly by the Network Team Managers and Cork Kerry Community Healthcare Disability Services have put in place additional waitlist initiatives with external agencies to support caseload management, using time related savings, including preliminary team assessments under the Assessment of Need process. </p></reply>

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.</p>  <p>  In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) collect, collate and publish waiting lists in respect of outpatient specialties and inpatient/daycase procedures. The NTPF have advised my Department that waiting times can be examined in terms of the appointment or procedure that a patient is waiting for, however, it is not possible to identify the number of patients waiting by clinical diagnosis, for example how many patients with spina bifida are on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  While waiting list data is classified in this very specific way, it is possible to provide a broader update in terms of services for children with Spina Bifida.  Children's Health Ireland have advised my Department that Temple Street has doubled its capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. This will improve access to specialists in the area of Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, and Neuropsychology. The clinics also provide access to a Medical Social worker and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments.</p>  <p>  Children with Spina Bifida often require specialist orthopaedic procedures. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision, particularly for Children's Health Ireland. On the 7th February 2022, I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss increased orthopaedic activity at CHI and additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures, including children with Spina Bifida, by year end.</p>  <p>  In order to tackle waiting lists for orthopaedic paediatric surgery and support the needs of patients with Spina Bifida, an additional &euro;5 million has recently been committed to improve access, including through additional theatre and diagnostic capacity to be brought on stream this year. </p>  <p>  This funding will be used to build on the working on-going to improve access to orthopaedics. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively.</p>  <p>  Children's Health Ireland have confirmed that they continue to examine new and innovative ways to improve access to orthopaedic services. &ldquo;Cappagh Kids&rdquo; at the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional theatre capacity for non-complex, age appropriate, orthopaedic procedures, freeing up much needed space at central CHI sites for children with complex, multi-disciplinary needs. Additional orthopaedic outpatient sessions are also now held at Cappagh, providing additional capacity to see and assess children on the outpatient waiting list.</p>  <p>  In addition, a new fast-track orthopaedic pathway has been developed as part of outpatient reduction plans. Paediatric Active Clinical Triage has already been introduced for the longest waiters (over 12 months) on the paediatric outpatient list.</p>  <p>  More broadly, improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  Today I brought to Government the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan which includes high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come to ensure that our waiting lists are in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets. This process will be driven forward and overseen by the Waiting List Task Force, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes the CEO&rsquo;s and other senior representatives from the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p></reply>

Furthermore, due to a combination of screening and treatment improvements, the mortality rate for breast cancer in Ireland has steadily and significantly declined in Ireland over the period 1994-2018. This is also evident in the survival rates for breast cancer, which have increased from 69% in 1994-1999 to 88% for those diagnosed between 2014-2018. Indeed, of the 200,000 estimated cancer survivors in Ireland in 2019, almost a quarter of these were patients with a previous breast cancer diagnosis.</p><p>I am fully committed to supporting our population screening programmes which are a valuable part of our health service, enabling early treatment and care for many people, and improving the overall health of our population. I am pleased to inform that, in line with commitments in the Programme for Government, BreastCheck are now implementing the commitment on age-extension so that all women aged between 50 to 69 years are invited for routine breast screening. </p><p>Regarding any further changing or lowering the age eligibility for BreastCheck, the National Screening Service (NSS) has advised that BreastCheck delivers its services in line with international criteria for screening programmes, based on the best international evidence, which is kept under constant review.  In this regard, it is important to be aware, that future decisions about changes to our national screening programmes, including reducing the age range in breast screening, will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC).  This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms.  It may be of interest to that the NSAC recently held its first 'Annual Call', importantly it gave members of the public and health professionals an opportunity to suggest new screening programmes or modifications to existing ones.  I am looking forward to receiving recommendations from the NSAC and will be guided by such to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s population-based screening programmes continues to evolve in line with new evidence and developments.</p><p>It is an important message, screening is for healthy people without symptoms.  If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. It is important that every woman is breast aware. This means knowing what is normal for them so that if any unusual change occurs, they will recognise it. The National Screening Service and BreastCheck have useful information in relation to breast health on their website. </p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Clinical leadership is central to the delivery of the changes required by our healthcare system and reducing waiting lists. National Clinical Programmes (NCPs) are the vehicle through which multi-disciplinary clinical design leadership and innovation are enabled. Since their inception in 2010, the National Clinical Programmes have been a key transforming force in delivering change and continue to play a strong role in supporting the transformation that is required in healthcare. </p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programmes enable surgeons, doctors, nurses, health and social care professionals, and hospital managers with expertise in their clinical service area, to work in collaboration to develop standardised care pathways, clinical guidelines and models of care for the patient journey. These models of care emphasise evidenced-based pathways and new ways of working to support better patient access and quality of care.</p>  <p>  NCPs are involved in the development of key national policy strategies, including the National Cancer Strategy. Some of the NCPs include: The Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) programme, The National Clinical Programme for Heart Failure, The National Clinical Programme for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, The National Clinical Programme for Gastroenterology and Hepatology.</p>  <p>  In addition the Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system</p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The taskforce will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p></reply>

In Budget 2022, the fund received an additional &euro;5 million which will allow us to continue to invest in women&rsquo;s health nationwide.</p><p>To date, I have announced a number of investments made through the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund such as funding for community-based Ambulatory Gynaecology Services and for enhanced endometriosis services for more complex cases. Both of which are on track for implementation in 2022, along with a number of other significant projects funded through the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund in 2021.</p><p>Other than the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund, there are a number of key initiatives that I am happy to see allocated funding through Budget 2022. </p><p>&euro;8.66m has been allocated to the National Maternity Strategy for 2022, which builds on the significant investment of &euro;7.3m allocated in 2021. This funding will permit the recruitment of an additional 99.5 WTEs into maternity services, the development of two Postnatal Hubs and the continued implementation of the National Maternity Strategy. The National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) has completed its engagement with all maternity units and prioritisation of posts to be recruited is currently being finalised. The Programme continues to engage with the Hospital Groups to ensure that planned developments in maternity services remain on schedule.</p><p>Aligning with the priorities set out in the <i>Programme for Government: Our Shared Future</i>, we will see the roll out of a free contraception programme for women and girls aged 17-25, expected to commence in August 2022, at a cost of approximately &euro;9 million. The scheme will include the full range of contraceptive options already available to GMS (medical) card holders, two GP visits per year, and any necessary fitting, removal and check-up appointments required for long-acting reversible contraception.</p><p>A significant portion of the overall investment has been allocated to the continued investment in significant service developments, such as ambulatory gynaecological services.</p><p>Budget 2022 provided &euro;3.31m to facilitate the establishment of the final six ambulatory gynaecology clinics, which will bring the total number of such clinics around the country to 20. This will complete the implementation of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care. I am advised that NWIHP has completed its engagement with the relevant hospitals in relation to these clinics and has indicated that these developments are on schedule. </p><p>Similarly, with an investment of &euro;0.58 million, further developments will be made in menopause care through the development of three new specialist menopause clinics based in Galway, Cork and Limerick respectively. This follows on from the establishment of the first such clinic in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street last year. The operationalisation of the new clinics will be dependent on resourcing the necessary staff, however, NWIHP has advised that the engagement with the relevant Hospital Groups in this regard is progressing as planned. </p><p>A further &euro;0.25 million has been allocated to Sexual Assault Treatment Units, which will enhance the services provided in this area over the course of 2022.</p><p>A portion of this funding, &euro;0.54 million, has been allocated to the establishment of a Obstetric Event Support Team within the National Women and Infants Health Programme, To date, Phase 1 has been rolled out in the Saolta, South/Southwest and UL Hospital Groups, with Phase 2 due to commence in March 2022 covering the remaining Hospital Groups. </p><p>Along with continued investment in ongoing development, Budget 2022 commits &euro;0.7 million as a first-time investment in tackling period poverty. Following a call for expressions of interest, my Department is engaging with Local Authorities with regard to period poverty mitigation measures in their areas. Planning in partnership with HSE Social Inclusion and local community representatives has commenced with regard to initial roll-out to Travellers and Roma. Engagement with the voluntary sector will commence in the next few weeks.</p><p>The remainder of the fund will see us build on initiatives started in 2021, by further extending the complex endometriosis services (&euro;1.39 million) that I mentioned previously along with the commencement of a structured and resourced service in the Dublin and Cork regions for perinatal genetics services (&euro;1.34 million). I understand that NWIHP is engaging with the proposed service providers and this project remains on schedule. </p><p>Details on the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce are found at www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/-womens-health/.</p></reply>

Budget 2021 provided funding to greatly increase the health workforce. Across 2020 and 2021, Nursing and Midwifery staffing has had a net increase of 3,372 WTE. The commitment to building capacity in the health sector was emphasised again in Budget 2022, which provides funding for a further growth in the workforce of up to 141,491 WTE. We are working with the HSE to finalise the numbers to be recruited by staff category for 2022.</p><p>In addition to the above, the Strategic Plan for Critical Care aims to increase critical care capacity in Ireland to 446 in the longer term. Available staffing is a critical aspect of critical care provision and is often reported as being the foremost limiting factor in attempts to increase capacity.</p><p>A total of &euro;77m has been provided for implementation of the Strategic Plan over 2021 and 2022. This will allow national critical care capacity to increase to 340 by 2023. This funding includes provision for the additional staff required to open these beds, as well as funding to increase the number of places available on critical care nurse training programmes and to recruit additional onsite nurse educators to support training in a hospital setting.</p><p>Building on the evidence from the last two years, funding for 2022 has been allocated to support strategic and permanent increase in advanced practice across the system in line with Sl&aacute;intecare. The Minister has committed to increasing the target of 2% of the nursing and midwifery workforce at advanced practice level to 3% over the next two years. This significant investment in the nursing and midwifery workforce, will enhance patient experiences, as well as offering more career opportunities for nurses and midwives to address population health needs across the system.  <b></b></p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school, or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled, who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to request the National Immunisation Advisory Committee consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p>  <p>  If the NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p></reply>

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out of hours co-operatives as a means of meeting the contractual requirement, such services facilitate the provision of GP services outside of normal surgery hours and help to spread the burden of this provision. A small number of areas are not covered by GP out of hours co-operatives, instead out of hours services are provided by local GPs.</p>  <p>  The HSE is in regular contact with out of hours service providers. In particular, over the past two years there has been greater engagement to ensure that the services can continue to provide the supports needed by local communities. In recognition of the key role GP out of hours service providers play in the delivery of our health service and the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, a financial and service stability arrangement for GP Out of Hours cooperatives was introduced with effect from 14th March 2020. </p>  <p>  GP out of hours cooperatives are private organisations. The HSE provides significant funding to support out of hours co-operative services through service level agreements. As the HSE has responsibility for determining the allocation of funding from its budget, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly in relation to the resources currently provided to out of hours co-operatives, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified. HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel and HIQA and the HPSC are developing a further update to this analysis.</p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations. &euro;17.6m has been allocated in Budget 2022 to continue implementation of the Expert Panel recommendations.</p>  <p>  The establishment and parameters of any broader review or evaluation, following the pandemic, of the State&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 would be a matter for Government to decide on at the appropriate time. However, as noted, ongoing learning from the pandemic has been a key component of the management of COVID-19 and to add further to this, the Minister has recently established a Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group which, amongst other things, will initially focus on identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland with a view towards strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness specifically.</p></reply>

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.</p><p>Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.</p><p>Two months ago, I met with the Scoliosis Co-Design Group. This is a well-established and successful group which facilitates a multi-disciplinary approach to service improvement. The group includes members from advocacy groups, as well as orthopaedic consultants from Children's Health Ireland, and senior management from across the CHI sites.  Further to this meeting I requested that Children's Health Ireland (CHI) draw up a plan to improve waiting times for orthopaedic services, particularly for those children with conditions such as scoliosis and Spina Bifida where time is a crucial factor in ensuring that these children have a positive outcome from their surgeries. </p><p>Last week I convened a meeting with the clinical teams from Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital, along with senior management from these hospitals and the HSE. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the draft orthopaedic waiting list plan and to ensure that an appropriate plan with ambitious and attainable activity levels was being produced. The plan will be funded in the context of the wider waiting list action plan for 2022 and will include additional activity to reduce the spinal orthopaedic waiting list through the use of theatres at Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh. In the context of the waiting list action plan additional capacity will also be sought in the private sector to work towards reducing paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. </p><p>In terms of broader services for children with Spina Bifida, CHI have advised the Department of Health that CHI at Temple Street has doubled capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. This will improve access to specialists in the area of Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, and Neuropsychology. The clinics also provide access to a Medical Social worker and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments. </p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p></reply>

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing. There is no prescribed ratio of GPs to patients and the State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community. Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP.</p>  <p>  Currently there are 14 GMS GP contracts listed in Lucan, none of which are vacant.  One contract holder is retiring imminently, and this list has been advertised by the Primary Care GP Unit.</p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.</p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland. </p></reply>

In order to provide additional capacity, including new infection prevention and control measures, approval was granted to complete a temporary extension to the Emergency Department (ED). This includes segregated waiting areas, segregated treatment areas, isolation rooms, additional resuscitation spaces and additional support accommodation to take account of requirements to treat Covid-19 patients and improved Infection Control and Prevention requirements for the ED.  </p>  <p>  This Temporary ED extension building will be a single storey, with a rooftop plant room and will be connected to the main hospital block at the existing ED entrance. This project is expected to be completed in early 2022. The Temporary ED project and associate works will also serve as an enabling works project for the proposed new permanent ED and free up the site required for the proposed new unit.</p>  <p>  The main ED, Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s development at University Hospital Galway is a project is of significant scale and must progress through the stages outlined in the public spending code (PSC). The full accommodation scope for the entire development has been agreed following an internal HSE review and the HSE propose to progress the full block as one single project. </p>  <p>  There is no date set yet for the planning application for the main building as the project is still proceeding through the stages of the PSC. There are several enabling works projects to be completed on site before the main building can go ahead. The Design Team has had pre-planning meetings with the Local Authority on two of these enabling works projects. The preliminary business case is currently under review with the HSE and pending Board approval. The HSE expect to be able to submit the preliminary business case to my Department in Q1 2022 for technical review in line with PSC requirements. </p>  <p>  The PSC is designed to ensure that investment decisions are underpinned by a clear policy rationale, and that costs are well understood. In 2019, the PSC was updated and introduced a new project lifecycle, tightening the arrangements for project decision-making, and clarifying the roles of the parties involved including the responsibilities for Sponsoring Agencies and Approving Authorities.</p>  <p>  All capital development proposals must progress through several approval stages, in line with the new lifecycle approach of the updated PSC, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The HSE is also required to undertake periodic reviews of eligibility in order to ensure that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that where any medical or GP visit card holder has a review process initiated, he/she will continue to retain their eligibility for the duration of the review process (typically three months). Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to provide an eligibility assessment process that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services and to that end, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold.</p></reply>

The Review considers the delivery of cardiac services nationally, including in the South East region. </p>  <p>  Substantial progress has been made on the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.  While progress was impacted during 2020 and into 2021 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Cardiac Services Review is now making significant progress again, and the Steering Group is currently working on the development of the proposed recommendations of the draft Report, with a view to finalising the Report at an early date.  </p></reply>

Teleconsultations, as a means of engaging with patients where a physical examination is not required, were widely used across the health system during the pandemic. For instance, GPs used both phone and video channels specifically developed for the clinical environment, as options to offer their patients access to triage and referral for testing. Specific rates for reimbursement of GPs who chose to offer these services were agreed. Leveraging long standing and close working relationships with colleagues in NHS Scotland, the HSE deployed a solution called 'Attend Anywhere' and set up a programme to make it available to hospitals, outpatient departments and other care services and settings across the country where there was value in offering such a solution. In many instances, the challenging health environment accelerated use of digital solutions that might otherwise have taken longer to adopt.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to support the practical implementation and adoption of eHealth, digital health and ICT developments in 2022 and beyond.</p></reply>

This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified. HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel and HIQA and the HPSC are developing a further update to this analysis.</p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations. &euro;17.6m has been allocated in Budget 2022 to continue implementation of the Expert Panel recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Department requested, as a once off measure and for the purposes of providing additional supports, that the Patient Advocacy Service extend its service to Dealgan House Nursing Home in order to support families during this time. I understand that the CEO of the HSE met with family members of residents in the nursing home. Minister Donnelly and I also met with the families of residents to hear their perspectives.</p>  <p>  The establishment and parameters of any broader review or evaluation, following the pandemic, of the State&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 would be a matter for Government to decide on at the appropriate time. However, as noted, ongoing learning from the pandemic has been a key component of the management of COVID-19 and to add further to this, the Minister has recently established a Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group which, amongst other things, will initially focus on identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland with a view towards strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness specifically.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive is leading on the implementation framework in respect of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.The Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy Implementation Framework (IF) was launched in February 2019. </p>  <p>  The overarching aim of the Strategy is the development of neuro-rehabilitation services to improve patient outcomes by providing safe, high quality, person-centred neuro-rehabilitation at the lowest appropriate level of complexity. This must be integrated across the care pathway, and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres where necessary. These services should be configured into population based managed clinical rehabilitation networks (MCRNs). The MCRN, while an effective model in a number of European countries, is a new concept in Ireland. MCRNs are recognised as having the potential to bring together an appropriate range of primary, secondary and tertiary services to ensure equitable provision of high quality and clinically effective services.</p>  <p>  Funding has been sought and approved to support the introduction of a managed clinical rehabilitation network demonstrator project. The focus of the demonstrator project is the development of post-acute and community neuro-rehabilitation services across CHO 6 &amp;amp; 7. In terms of service provision, this is where the gap is most evident in terms of demonstrating a Network model.</p>  <p>  Disability Services Community Healthcare area 6 are currently working on the recruitment process, capital funding for the service has already been received and the location for the Community Neurorehabilitation Team (CNRT) has been identified. Disability Services Community Healthcare area 7 are working with Primary Care to identify the location &amp;amp; governance for the Community Neurorehabilitation Team in this area.</p>  <p>  Of the 37 posts funded under Sl&aacute;intecare, 26 were allocated to Peamount for the opening of the 10 bedded unit, the Rehabilitation Coordinator posts is in place and the other community posts as advised above are in the process of recruitment. </p>  <p>  There has been tangible progress with the focus and trajectory of the MCRN in the development of the post-acute and community neurorehabilitation teams and services. The implementation of a 10 bedded neurorehabilitation unit in Peamount has improved timely and early access to post-acute specialist rehabilitation services for patients with complex disability including those neurological complications associated with severe COVID infection from the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.</p></reply>

The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Health Service Executive, Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code, setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects.</p>  <p>  In December 2021 the Government agreed, subject to the necessary approvals and requirements under the Public Spending Code being met, a new National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy. This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. No other locations are under active consideration. It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement an elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including Limerick and neighbouring mid-west counties.</p>  <p>  The elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases commencing with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients and then by in-patient treatment. On this basis, the Elective Care Centres (ECCs) will be designed to provide sufficient capacity to facilitate future phases, including some elective in patient capacity, thereby providing a sustainable and strategic response to cater for the highly dynamic landscape of healthcare policy and practice. </p>  <p>  A Programme Preliminary Business Case and a Project Preliminary Business Case (PBC) for Cork have now been completed, while project PBCs for Galway and Dublin are at an advanced stage of development.  The Business Cases will be subject to technical review by the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including through the recently introduced External Assurance Process. Pending favourable review(s) under the Spending Code, further memoranda for Government would then be brought forward to progress the programme for Cork, Galway and Dublin.</p></reply>

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.</p>  <p>  Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.</p>  <p>  Two months ago, I met with the Scoliosis Co-Design Group. This is a well-established and successful group which facilitates a multi-disciplinary approach to service improvement. The group includes members from advocacy groups, as well as orthopaedic consultants from Children's Health Ireland, and senior management from across the CHI sites.  Further to this meeting I requested that Children's Health Ireland (CHI) draw up a plan to improve waiting times for orthopaedic services, particularly for those children with conditions such as scoliosis and Spina Bifida where time is a crucial factor in ensuring that these children have a positive outcome from their surgeries. </p>  <p>  Last week I convened a meeting with the clinical teams from Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital, along with senior management from these hospitals and the HSE. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the draft orthopaedic waiting list plan and to ensure that an appropriate plan with ambitious and attainable activity levels was being produced. The plan will be funded in the context of the wider waiting list action plan for 2022 and will include additional activity to reduce the spinal orthopaedic waiting list through the use of theatres at Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh. In the context of the waiting list action plan additional capacity will also be sought in the private sector to work towards reducing paediatric orthopaedic waiting times.</p>  <p>  In terms of broader services for children with Spina Bifida, CHI have advised the Department of Health that CHI at Temple Street has doubled capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. This will improve access to specialists in the area of Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, and Neuropsychology. The clinics also provide access to a Medical Social worker and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments.</p>  <p>  The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The taskforce will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in my Department.

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7 and my Department has commenced work to roll the service out this year.</p>  <p>  The specific date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and will require consultation with the IMO, representing General Practitioners. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-15a.291.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022021500060#WRF04100"><p>Improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes is a key priority for me and this Government. We  have made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.</p>  <p>  Significant activity is currently underway to enhance the supports available to women through the menopause. I announced my commitment to establish dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland on the 10th of September 2021. These clinics will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.</p>  <p>  The first specialist menopause clinic opened in the National Maternity Hospital in December 2021. Building on this development, Budget 2022 provided further commitment to a focussed approach in menopause care with funding for three further specialist menopause clinics, to bring the number of clinics nationally to four. Once in place, specialist menopause clinics will be provided in Dublin, Limerick, Galway and Cork working to complement the menopause support available to women in their community.</p>  <p>  Additional activity underway and planned in the area of menopause includes:</p>  <p>  ‎</p>  <p>  - GP training is a key aspect of women receiving the best care through menopause. The Irish College of GPs are active members of the Women's Health Taskforce and continue to be engaged on how women's health can be better considered within the primary care setting. Relevant activity includes the collaboration between ICGP and the British Menopause Society to develop training in menopause management, which is currently in place; a ICGP Women&rsquo;s Health Webinar on menopause and endometriosis which was held in June 2021 and had 1567 attendees; and a GP Education course which was established in September 2021 in the area of Community Gynaecology Course which includes menopause as a topic. Funding has been provided through the Women's Health Fund to develop a 'quick reference guide' for GPs on the menopause, to support primary care provision in this area. </p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to the Deputy's query on a women&rsquo;s health structured care programme, I have outlined my support for a new ICGP post of Clinical Lead for Women&rsquo;s Health in General Practice, the first such post in Ireland. This is currently being progressed and once in place, the Clinical Lead will provide the essential leadership to drive forward an ambitious agenda to enable a comprehensive life-course approach to women&rsquo;s health in general practice. </p>  <p>  Further activity in the area of menopause includes:‎‎</p>  <p>  ‎‎ - A number of health topics relating to women's health, including menopause, have recently been updated and are now live on the HSE A-Z. This information is an important first step towards delivering enhanced information and education on menopause. A public information webinar on the menopause was held on November 29th 2021.</p>  <p>  - A civil service webinar on 'Menopause at work' was held on October 18th, and further HR training to better understand the challenges and solutions for supporting women in their menopause journey within the civil service was held on November 30th.  The Healthy Workplace Framework, published in December 2021, aims to support the growth of effective approaches to enhance health and wellbeing in the workplace. The Framework is underpinned by robust evidence and consultation. An Implementation Group is in the process of being established, which will hold responsibility for developing an action plan. It is envisaged that a representative from Women&rsquo;s Health will be included on the Implementation Group to help ensure the needs of women in the workplace are incorporated.</p>  <p>  At present, GPs provide consultations without charge to women who have a medical card or GP visit card. Approved prescribed drugs and medicines, including HRT, are available free to medical card holders, subject to the statutory prescription charge. In addition, under the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;100 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</p>  <p>  Further research is required to understand the cost and benefit of such a development. This will be considered when planning for further menopause activity to take place in 2022.</p>  <p>  The issue of menopause in particular has also been emphasised through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. This was a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.  278 women participated in open interviews and workshops, where menopause was a recurring theme. Through this process, the taboo around discussing menopause, and a lack of trusted information, were consistently raised as key issues for women experiencing menopause. I published a report on the findings of the &lsquo;Radical listening&rsquo; exercise on September 14th 2021 which can be found here:</p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/ebe3e-significant-milestone-as-minister-donnelly-publishes-a-report-of-womens-voices-on-womens-health-following-a-radical-listening-exercise-this-year/  </p></reply>

This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified. HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel and HIQA and the HPSC are developing a further update to this analysis.</p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations. &euro;17.6m has been allocated in Budget 2022 to continue implementation of the Expert Panel recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Department requested, as a once off measure and for the purposes of providing additional supports, that the Patient Advocacy Service extend its service to Dealgan House Nursing Home in order to support families during this time. I understand that the CEO of the HSE met with family members of residents in the nursing home. Minister Donnelly and I also met with the families of residents to hear their perspectives.</p>  <p>  The establishment and parameters of any broader review or evaluation, following the pandemic, of the State&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 would be a matter for Government to decide on at the appropriate time. However, as noted, ongoing learning from the pandemic has been a key component of the management of COVID-19 and to add further to this, the Minister has recently established a Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group which, amongst other things, will initially focus on identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland with a view towards strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness specifically.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-15a.303.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022021500060#WRF05300"><p>I acknowledge that waiting times for many hospital procedures and appointments are unacceptably long. It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.</p><p>Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.</p><p>Two months ago, I met with the Scoliosis Co-Design Group. This is a well-established and successful group which facilitates a multi-disciplinary approach to service improvement. The group includes members from advocacy groups, as well as orthopaedic consultants from Children's Health Ireland, and senior management from across the CHI sites.  Further to this meeting I requested that Children's Health Ireland (CHI) draw up a plan to improve waiting times for orthopaedic services, particularly for those children with conditions such as scoliosis and Spina Bifida where time is a crucial factor in ensuring that these children have a positive outcome from their surgeries. </p><p>Last week I convened a meeting with the clinical teams from Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital, along with senior management from these hospitals and the HSE. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the draft orthopaedic waiting list plan and to ensure that an appropriate plan with ambitious and attainable activity levels was being produced. The plan will be funded in the context of the wider waiting list action plan for 2022 and will include additional activity to reduce the spinal orthopaedic waiting list through the use of theatres at Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh. In the context of the waiting list action plan additional capacity will also be sought in the private sector to work towards reducing paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. </p><p>In terms of broader services for children with Spina Bifida, CHI have advised the Department of Health that CHI at Temple Street has doubled capacity from 2 Multidisciplinary (MDT) clinics to 4 MDT outpatient clinics per month. This will improve access to specialists in the area of Neurodisability, Neurosurgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, and Neuropsychology. The clinics also provide access to a Medical Social worker and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. CHI has advised the Department that this capacity increase is expected to provide each child with an annual review and will reduce the waiting time for follow up appointments. </p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual Waiting List plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p></reply>

Since the beginning of January 2020, an additional 12,506 WTE have been added to the workforce, which is an increase of 10% above 2019 levels. 7,592 of these WTE have been additional to the Acute sector.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has provided funding for a further large-scale expansion of the health service workforce. A risk has been identified of a reduction of labour supply, given the large amount of recruitment that has already been achieved. To mitigate the risks associated with recruitment in 2022 and to achieve recruitment targets to the fullest extent possible, a number of steps are being taken by the HSE including expanding recruitment capacity, engaging third party agencies to carry out recruitment and expansion of international recruitment frameworks.</p>  <p>  With regard to consultant recruitment specifically, in 2021 the Health Service Executive undertook a full review of their processes for the recruitment of consultants to the health service. A Recruitment &amp;amp; Resourcing Governance Steering Group was established and in line with the work of this group, a small Working Group formed to specifically examine processes around the recruitment of Medical Consultants.  </p>  <p>  An &lsquo;end to end&rsquo; process mapping of the approval and recruitment process was completed by the Working Group which highlighted several areas for improvement and work is ongoing in this regard, however several measures have already been taken to improve this recruitment process.  </p>  <p>  These include revising the process for the Consultant Applications Advisory Committee (CAAC) and National Recruitment Service (NRS) application form and Job Specification, reviewing consultant competencies and implementing revised and safe screening processes to reduce duplication and times to hire.</p>  <p>  The benefits of the targeted approaches taken to consultant recruitment are emerging in our performance since the onset of the pandemic with an excess of +300 WTE consultants in post above December 2019 levels. The HSE are working with the PAS to ensure that the appropriate infrastructure and resources are in place within the PAS to process the continued increase in 2022.</p>  <p>  Looking forward, there are several initiatives planned for 2022 to build on the progress made and improve further on the recruitment and retention of consultants to the health workforce in Ireland. </p>  <p>  These will include reducing the time costs associated with the application process and onboarding of consultants. Ensuring there is greater transparency and access to concurrent data on consultant recruitment status activity and the development of comprehensive marketing including a Medical Consultant microsite Increased access to supports when engaging in the application process. The centralisation of administration requirements which will deliver a reduction in the duplication of processes across multiple sites.</p>  <p>  The deputy may wish to note that there has been a 17% increase of Higher Specialist Trainees since 2017 which, going forward, will translate into more qualified candidates for consultant roles as they complete training.</p></reply>

From the outset of the pandemic, great focus has been placed by the cancer services on providing safe patient pathways and encouraging people to come forward. Urgent cancer services were maintained throughout the pandemic.</p><p>By the time Wave 2, and subsequent Covid Waves, occurred, the degree of resilience built up in cancer services, through staff commitment, revised treatment guidelines, social distancing and infection prevention and control measures, instilled confidence in people that they could access cancer diagnostics and treatment.  Accordingly, services were much less impacted. </p><p>As indicated, we are continuing to closely monitor trends in numbers coming forward to diagnostic services, and the level of attendances for appointments for treatment. Based on the most recent figures available: </p><p>- the total number of GP e-referrals to cancer Rapid Access Clinics for 2021 stands at 130% of the activity in 2019;  </p><p>- the total number of patients seen across all Rapid Access Clinics for 2021 stands at 102% of the activity in 2019; </p><p>- the number of patients receiving chemotherapy for January-November 2021 is at approximately 95% of 2019 activity;</p><p>- the number of patients receiving radiation oncology for January-November 2021 is at 85% of 2019 activity; and  </p><p>- the number undergoing surgical oncology for January-November 2021 is at 80%.  </p><p>In December 2021, the Royal College of Physicians Ireland (RCPI), in conjunction with organisations such as the National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI) and NCCP, published a report titled <i>'Cancer care in Ireland in 2020 &ndash; The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic'.</i>NCRI data included in the report indicates that, as expected, the number of cancer diagnoses in 2020 was lower than in 2019 due to Covid-19. While the full extent of the impact of Covid-19 on cancer patients will not be known until the NCRI 2020 data reaches maturity, the NCRI suggests that the reduction may be between 10% and 14% of the expected figure (which allows for increasing trends due to our increasing and ageing population). </p><p>The Government has provided significant extra funding for cancer services in Ireland. Funding of &euro;5m has been provided in 2022 to continue the work of supporting cancer services and increasing capacity in the context of Covid-19. This is in addition to the &euro;12m allocated in 2021. This funding is facilitating additional clinics and the extension of clinic times, as well as allowing for minor infrastructural works to be carried out and for locum and temporary staff to be recruited to support the delivery of services. </p><p>In addition, there has been significant investment over the last two years for implementation  of the National Cancer Strategy, with &euro;20m provided in 2021 and a further &euro;20m in 2022. This funding is being utilised to advance the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and to provide continued support for patients living with and beyond cancer.</p><p>In conclusion, I would emphasise that it remains important to stress that anyone with concerns about cancer should visit their GP, who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. Our cancer diagnostic and treatment services are open, and our healthcare staff will provide any necessary care.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school, or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled, who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to request the National Immunisation Advisory Committee consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p>  <p>  If the NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p></reply>

The health sector is expecting to face significant challenges this winter in providing emergency care while also dealing with Covid-19. Emergency department attendances are close to 2019 levels, exceeding them at some sites, while the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys have been increasing steadily since June 2021.</p><p>I met with senior HSE management on the 9th February to discuss the current challenges facing emergency departments. They outlined some very specific challenges in the system at the moment. Higher than normal levels of attendance in recent weeks, combined with around 600 Covid-19 inpatients and 600 delayed transfers of care, is putting intense pressure on hospital capacity. It is increasingly difficult to discharge some patients who need nursing home or stepdown care due to the number of Covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes. There are also difficulties in discharging some patients home due to issues with providing home care. These issues are compounded by the level of staff absenteeism related to Covid-19. I have requested the HSE to take all appropriate action to mitigate these challenges, as far as possible. </p><p>We have put significant resources into preparing the system for winter. 1,146 acute hospital beds were funded under last year&rsquo;s Winter Plan and Budget 2021. To date, over 800 acute beds have opened since the 1st January 2020 across the hospital system, excluding critical care beds. </p><p>The HSE Winter Preparedness Plan for Winter 21/22 builds on the significant investment in last year&rsquo;s Winter Plan and the additional capacity delivered in health services in 2021, and centres on three core objectives: ED avoidance, patient flow and hospital egress to mitigate the expected challenges in providing emergency care during winter while also continuing to respond to Covid-19.</p><p>The Plan recognizes that a whole system response is required and outlines how the HSE proposes to manage these challenges across primary, community and acute care including measures to allow the public system to access private healthcare capacity.</p><p>This plan endorses a home first approach, enabling and facilitating patients to receive the most appropriate care in their own homes and communities.</p><p>The Plan contains a number of initiatives to deliver its core objectives of ED avoidance by treating people at home or in the community and by allowing them to return home following hospitalisation quickly. These initiatives include:</p><p>-  GP Liaison Nurses to manage direct referrals from GPs to ED;</p><p>-  Geriatric Community Support;</p><p>-  Enhancement and expansion of Frailty Intervention Therapy Team models;</p><p>-  Community Response Teams (nursing and therapies);</p><p>-  Community respiratory admission avoidance teams;</p><p>-  Expansion of the National Ambulance Service Pathfinder initiative</p><p>-  Additional home support hours and</p><p>-  COPD outreach teams. </p></reply>

Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners.</p>  <p>  As GPs are self-employed practitioners, they therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing. </p>  <p>  The 2019 GP Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future, including ensuring the sustainability of the business model for practices.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-15a.397.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022021500062#WRH02800"><p>Ireland operates a managed employment permits system maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market. The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy. However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review.</p>  <p>  Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment, and Ireland was one of the few countries which has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.</p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  </p>  <p>  My Department has issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 at the end of January 2022, which is now stabilising.</p>  <p>  In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.  </p>  <p>  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the impact delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and has developed a plan of action to reduce processing times built up over the pandemic. My Department has approved a trebling of staff in the employment permits section in order to deal with the increase in applications. </p>  <p>  As the plan to deal with this issue is implemented and begins to take effect, we expect to see improvements shortly, with the backlog considerably reduced by the end of Q1 and substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.  My Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.  A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.  This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period.</p>  <p>  The Department provides regular updates on its website in relation to processing times and engages directly with key stakeholders including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups and individual companies, as required.</p>  <p>  Applicants can keep track of Employment Permit applications current processing dates at enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Current-Application-Processing-Dates</p>  <p>  The Management Board of my Department is overseeing the implementation of the plan of action and its impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

In relation to the Register of Beneficial Ownership, an initial return is required providing details of beneficial ownership and any further return is dependent on subsequent changes to beneficial ownership details.</p>  <p>  There are particular provisions in company law for small and/or micro companies in relation to audit exemption, the filing of abridged financial statements and the exemption from reporting on certain matters in the financial statements. </p>  <p>  Requirements regarding the timing of reporting obligations to the various entities vary with, by way of example, the Revenue Commissioners operating a single tax deadline while the timing of the annual return to be filed with the CRO is in the main based on the date of original incorporation of the company. In addition, taxation is on a calendar year basis while a company&rsquo;s financial statements are based on their own financial year which may or may not be a calendar year. </p>  <p>  In the circumstances, it is not considered the case that an annual return filed with the CRO would necessarily meet the filing requirements of other entities. However, in relation to company law filing requirements, the CRO seeks to make the filing process as straightforward as possible. In this regard, the new CRO IT system that went live in December 2020 has streamlined the process for filing annual returns into a single 56 day period and has replaced the requirement for the filing of physical signature pages with an electronic filing alternative.</p></reply>

Ireland supported the hydrogen strategy, including the need to deploy green hydrogen in line with ambition set out in the Programme for Government. Ireland also supported the EU Energy Council Conclusions on a hydrogen market for Europe in December 2020. In the development of these conclusions, Ireland strongly supported the need to focus on green hydrogen.</p>  <p>  The role of hydrogen, and actions needed for its development were considered as part of the development of the Climate Action Plan 2021. The Climate Action Plan 2021, published in November, identifies green hydrogen as having the potential to support decarbonisation across several sectors and, in particular, as a source for high-temperature heat in industry and flexible generation in electricity. A key target set out in the Climate Action Plan is to carry out a work programme to identify a route to deliver one to three terra-watt hours of zero emissions gas (including green hydrogen) by 2030. The plan includes a suite of actions relating to green hydrogen across the electricity, enterprise and transport chapters and includes:</p>  <p>  - testing the technical feasibility of safely injecting green hydrogen blends in the gas grid;</p>  <p>  - assessing the potential for system integration between the electricity and gas networks, which will include the production, storage and use of green hydrogen;</p>  <p>  - progressing research and pilot studies regarding the use of hydrogen in the transport sector. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is developing a number of initiatives on the role of green hydrogen in decarbonisation. The 2021 SEAI National Energy Research Development &amp;amp; Demonstration (RD&amp;D) Programme Call included a number of projects relating to green hydrogen, and the development of floating offshore wind foundations coupled with hydrogen storage. The SEAI is currently conducting the National Heat Study, which aims to examine options to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors in Ireland to 2050, including options for green hydrogen. The outcomes of this study are due to be published shortly. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the Climate Action Plan will be updated on an annual basis to reflect ongoing developments and targets achieved. I expect a strategy focussing on the development of green hydrogen to be included in Climate Action Plan 2022. </p></reply>

The Act commits Ireland to achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050, and provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 levels.</p>  <p>  The significantly strengthened legally binding framework under the Act sets clear targets and commitments in law, including embedding a process of carbon budgeting and sectoral emissions ceilings, and will help ensure that Ireland achieves its climate goals and obligations in the near and long-term. Establishing these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action.</p>  <p>  To deliver on the ambition set out in the Act, the Government published the Climate Action Plan 2021 last November. The 2021 Plan identifies the actions necessary to achieve our emissions reductions targets for each sector of the economy, based on their respective starting points, and the relative challenges and benefits, of reducing emissions. The indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector, as set out in the 2021 Plan, will become specific ceilings in the Climate Action Plan 2022, following the legal adoption of carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings. My Department will, in the coming months, engage proactively with the public, key stakeholders, and other Government Departments to prepare the 2022 Plan which I expect to publish it in Q4 of this year.</p></reply>

In order to ensure such a pipeline of community projects I have allocated &euro;2 million in capital funding in Budget 2022 to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). This funding will enable SEAI to deploy a range of capacity-building supports including an information warehouse, trusted intermediary and advisor services, and financial grant supports all of which are vital to support community-owned RESS projects in being built. Some of this framework of supports is already in place with additional elements to be delivered in early 2022.</p>  <p>  Prior to the RESS there was only one community-led renewable electricity project in Ireland, the Templederry Community Wind farm in Tipperary.  The first RESS auction (RESS-1) included a dedicated community category in which seven projects were selected for support, comprising five solar and two wind projects. The projects are still progressing and a number of milestones remain for each community project to meet in order for them to be eligible for support under RESS-1. </p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 143,000 free upgrades have been supported.  In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased significantly to &euro;17,100.  </p><p>There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme.

SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2021, the average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 26 months. While this delay was largely driven by Covid related issues, the deeper measures being provided under the scheme since 2018, also involve more substantive works.  </p><p>In order to reduce this timeline to completion, the following key actions are being taken:</p><p>- The budget, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;</p><p>- The number of homes retrofitted under the scheme are due to increase from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month in 2022;</p><p>- SEAI has allocated additional staff for the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme;</p><p>- SEAI is working to increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management.</p><p>Works under the Scheme recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector and activity did ramp up again towards the end of last year.

The Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty was published in 2016 and progress includes:</p><p>- Funding for SEAI's free energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period from &euro;15 million in 2015 to over &euro;118 million this year;</p><p>- The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the Social Housing Retrofit Programme this year; </p><p>- The Fuel Allowance has increased from &euro;20 per week in 2014/15 to &euro;33 per week for 2021/22 or &euro;924 per year, as well as an extension of the eligibility criteria for the payment, by the Minister for Social Protection. </p><p>- The Housing for All Strategy has committed to introducing additional rent controls that will result in rental properties having a required minimum Building Energy Rating;</p><p>- Protections are in place for customers falling into arrears on their energy bills. </p><p>Research published in 2016 found that 28% of households in Ireland would need to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs. More recently, the ESRI carried out an analysis of the number of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty. This showed that the share of households needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs was 17.5% in 2020. The Survey on Income and Living Conditions indicates that the proportion of people who reported that they are unable to afford to keep their home adequately warm, had fallen from 9% in 2015 to 3.4% in 2020.</p><p>In light of increased energy bills more recently, the Government has announced a package of supports which include: </p><p>- a number of changes to the Warmer Homes Scheme to better target the support available to those most in need in line with commitments set out in the National Retrofit Plan. </p><p>-  the introduction of an emergency measure which will provide a &euro;200 credit to all domestic electricity accounts;  </p><p>- increased grants for attic and cavity wall insulation, covering 80% of the cost to homeowners of these highly cost-effective upgrade measures; and </p><p>- a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance to be paid in early March to 390,000 recipients.</p><p>A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in the coming months to inform future policy in this area.</p></reply>

Enhancements to these schemes were announced last week with the launch of the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme.  </p>  <p>  These schemes are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and may be applicable to homes that are protected structures.  Grants for protected structures are available in certain circumstances subject to the scheme eligibility criteria and terms and conditions being met. Detailed information on the grants and eligibility criteria is available at www.seai.ie.  </p>  <p>  Protected structures are for the most part a subset of buildings categorised as traditionally built buildings. These tend to be stone or brick buildings which were designed to be vapour permeable and were mostly constructed before 1940. It is important that the materials and techniques used in energy efficiency upgrades of traditional buildings are suitable for the buildings in question including for use with vapour permeable construction where applicable. For example a stone wall with lime based mortar will need a lime based plaster render to remain vapour permeable. </p>  <p>  Central policy responsibility for protected structures and listed buildings is a matter for the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage. To support the proper upgrade of traditional buildings, including applicable listed buildings, a new Guidance Document - &ldquo;Energy Efficiency in Traditional Buildings&rdquo; is being developed by that Department. My Department and the SEAI are participating in the steering group overseeing the project. The objective is to finalise the guidance having regard to submissions received in the pubic consultation process with a view to publishing it this year.</p></reply>

The new framework ensures delivery of successive Climate Action Plans and Long-term Climate Strategies, supported by a system of carbon budgeting and sectoral targets with appropriate oversight by Government, the Oireachtas and a new Climate Change Advisory Council. Under the 2021 Act, Ministers will have to give an account of their performance in relation to their sectoral targets and actions before an Oireachtas Committee each year. This framework replaces the previous ATS process.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the changes introduced by the 2021 Act, I intend to publish an ATS for 2020. This ATS will set out information on developments in respect of 2019, as was required under the 2015 Act before it was amended. My Department has undertaken the preparation of this Statement through engagement with the relevant stakeholders. it is currently being finalised, and will be published before the end of March.</p></reply>

These measures are aimed at making it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills.  </p>  <p>  Included in these measures is the establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the current level of 30-35%). </p>  <p>  The new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme is a demand-led initiative that introduces a new way to undertake home energy upgrades with One-Stop-Shops providing an end-to-end service for homeowners. This includes surveying the home; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors to deliver the work; and quality assuring the work. </p>  <p>  Homes, built and occupied pre-2011, and owned by private homeowners, non-corporate landlords and Approved Housing Bodies are eligible for the scheme. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that a key feature of the new one stop shop model is that it will bring together groups of homes for aggregated projects thereby creating efficiencies in delivery and developing new innovation in processes and technologies. </p>  <p>  More broadly, officials of my Department will be working with Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to separately consider the best overall approaches to dealing with apartment buildings that are multi-unit buildings with common areas, rather than individual units. This will be investigated in 2022 to consider approaches to support whole building solutions.</p>  <p>  My Department has allocated a total of &euro;267 million in capital funding to the SEAI for residential and community retrofit schemes and the Solar PV scheme in 2022.  This is expected to deliver almost 27,000 energy efficiency upgrades, of which over 8,600 will be upgraded to a BER B2 or higher; and 4,240 heat pumps installed. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the Local Authority Retrofit Programme in 2022 which is expected to deliver approximately 2,400 B2 retrofits of Local Authority homes this year.</p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares.</p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme. </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision. All PSO providers are currently in receipt of emergency support funding to compensate for fare revenue loss arising as a result of the impact of Covid-19 on the sector, and the associated fall in passenger numbers (passenger numbers fell to below 10% of 2019 levels at the height of the restrictions in 2020 and 2021). Further, on 25/06/2020 Government approved the introduction of temporary financial supports for the licensed bus sector &ndash; commercial operators (in accordance with EU and national legislation).</p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). &euro;9m of the &euro;538m allocation has been provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector for the first three months of the year. While, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day. A further &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares. This is in addition to the forthcoming introduction of the Young Adult Card (YAC), which will provide people aged between 19 and 23, with an average discount on fares of 50%.</p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's  question  to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published for consultation early this year.</p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the roll-out of charge point  infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. </p>  <p>  The Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government which will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through the supports for on street chargers. I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund (CAF) to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles - 17 high power chargers distributed across 14 multi vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.  The installation of high powered charging hubs will be the priority for the remainder of the program.</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.  ESB are awaiting the delivery of new chargers which have twice the charging capacity and speed when compared to the existing technology.  This element of the programme will restart when the units are delivered and conclude in Q3.</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete, 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p>  <p>  The project is due to be completed in 2023.  </p>  <p>  Further details on ESB charge points nationwide can be found at www.esb.ie/ecars/charge-point-map</p>  <p>  In light of the ESB eCars responsibility in the matter of the provision of charge points, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the ESB for direct response.  Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The EVPP Working Group comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  </p>  <p>  The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is now available online.</p>  <p>  In order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil-fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. </p>  <p>  As such, the report recommended that cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years and that an Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. </p>  <p>  This new Office should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole-of-Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. Work is now under way to establish this OLEV.</p>  <p>  Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review with a view to making low-emission vehicles affordable.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The current medical criteria medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation). </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.</p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. </p>  <p>  In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within the wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

In the normal course of events, the introduction of any new tax expenditure measure generally takes place in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific question posed by the Deputy, it would also be usual that proposals for tax expenditure measures would be assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures, where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention; and that the potential for deadweight and additionality are considered.</p>  <p>  In terms of the most efficient use of scarce resources, a proposal along the lines of that mentioned by the Deputy would be likely to involve a very high nugatory element.

The EWSS is operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully meet the eligibility criteria for the scheme as set down in the legislation and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualify. </p>  <p>  To qualify for the EWSS, a business must have tax clearance and have suffered a minimum 30% reduction in turnover or business orders in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021, for pay dates on or between 1 July 2021 and 30 April 2022, due to the impact of COVID-19. The &lsquo;reference period&rsquo; used to establish the minimum 30% reduction varies depending on when a business commenced trading. For example, where a business was established prior to 1 January 2019, the &lsquo;reference period&rsquo; is 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. There is no discretion in the legislation to apply a different qualifying criteria other than the 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders in the reference period. This remains the case where a business diversifies into other trades.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question registered for EWSS in August 2020 and received payments until it deregistered from the scheme in early August 2021. As the business started trading prior to 2019, it is required to compare its turnover or customer orders against 2019 (reference period) to determine if there is a minimum 30% decline in turnover or business orders, for pay dates falling between 1 July 2021 to 30 April 2022. According to the information provided by the business, it is not currently experiencing this level of decline and as such is not entitled to the EWSS. This does not impact on eligibility for certain other COVID-19 support schemes such as the Debt Warehouse Scheme. </p>  <p>  Revenue confirmed to me that it has already engaged directly with the business to explain the eligibility criteria required for the EWSS. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in response to the additional public health measures announced on 17 December, the Government further announced on 21 December 2021, that the EWSS would reopen for certain businesses who would otherwise not be eligible and that such businesses could continue to be supported until the expiry of the scheme on 30 April 2022.</p>  <p>  The new arrangements for EWSS provided employers who had previously availed of EWSS but who were no longer eligible, with the opportunity to re-qualify for the scheme where they met certain conditions. Broadly, to re-qualify the business must experience a 30% reduction in turnover, or customer orders during a particular reference period. For example, for businesses established on or before 30 April 2019, to re-qualify for EWSS, the business must have anticipated that their combined turnover for December 2021 and January 2022 would be down by at least 30% compared with their combined turnover for December 2019 and January 2020. The business must also have a valid tax clearance certificate.</p>  <p>  Employers that qualified for re-entry to the scheme received support on a prospective basis from 1 January 2022, and they can remain in the scheme until its expiry date (30 April 2022).</p></reply>

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. Ireland applies excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to fuels used for motor or heating purposes. </p><p>MOT is comprised of a non-carbon and a carbon component; the carbon component is also referred to as carbon tax. The Deputy will be aware that the 2020 Programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from fuels to &euro;100 by 2030. I followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation in Finance Act 2020 to provide for a 10-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>by 2030. This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. </p><p>It is important to note that a significant portion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures, which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also in the long term, provides support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. </p><p>Of course, the Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices and for this reason we designed a package of measures to alleviate the impact of increased energy prices on households. </p><p>The package of measures includes:</p><p>- an increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households (to be paid in April)</p><p>- a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance will be paid in early March to 390,000 recipients</p><p>- to reduce the burden on people returning to the workplace and people using public transport, there will be a temporary reduction in fares of 20% from the end of April to the end of the year. This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users</p><p>- the original Sl&aacute;intecare report proposed a reduction of the Drug Payment Scheme from &euro;144 to &euro;100. The government has decided to reduce this further to &euro;80. This will benefit just over 70,000 families</p><p>- the working family payment budget increase announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from 1 June to 1 April</p><p>- reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children</p><p>In designing a support package, the Government was conscious of the need to target the main underlying problem &ndash; higher energy prices &ndash; while operating within the fiscal framework set out in the Summer Economic Statement. The suite of measures was announced last week and strikes the appropriate balance. This package provides support to every household via the electricity credit but also provides specific supports for more vulnerable households through targeted welfare measures.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that tax registered businesses are eligible to apply for a refund on the tax paid for fuels used in the course of business.Additionally, the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) allows qualifying road haulage and transport operators to claim a partial repayment of MOT on their transport fuels when the pump price of diesel goes above &euro;1.23 per litre. The DRS was amended in 2019 to increase the rate of rebate and it continues to be an important support to the road transport sector.</p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion of introducing an adjustable qualifier to result in variable MOT rates dependant on market fluctuations would undermine the tax policy initiatives that I have implemented to support delivery of critical emissions reductions strategies, including the allocation of expenditure for the Just Transition.  It is also a broad based measure which would not provide targeted support to those households most vulnerable to fuel poverty. I am satisfied that the package of measures announced last week, in addition to the support measures announced in Budget 2022, is the most effective means of reducing the impact of inflationary trends on households.  </p><p>On a general point regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal, I am advised by Revenue that administering fluctuating tax rates would be extremely challenging and likely to result in considerable additional administrative burden for taxpayers and for Revenue. The introduction of such complexity and relative uncertainty would be very inconsistent with best practice in tax policy and administration. </p><p>For the reasons I have outlined above, I do not intend to implement the measure suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

ETF investments can take many different legal and regulatory forms even where they are established within the same jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  An ETF is an investment fund that is traded on a regulated stock exchange. A typical ETF can be compared to a tracker fund in that it will seek to replicate a particular index. </p>  <p>  There is no separate taxation regime specifically for ETFs.  Being collective investment funds, they generally come within the regimes set out in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for such funds. The domicile of the ETF will generally determine the applicable fund regime, specifically whether the ETF falls within the domestic fund regime or the offshore fund regime. </p>  <p>  Where the domestic fund regime applies, a &lsquo;gross roll-up&rsquo; applies such that there is no annual tax on income or gains arising to a fund but the fund has responsibility to deduct an exit tax in respect of payments made to certain unit holders in that fund. To prevent indefinite or long-term deferral of this exit tax, a disposal is deemed to occur every 8 years.

This includes banks in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. </p>  <p>  However, both I and the Central Bank expect that all financial firms act in their customers best interests and treat them fairly, in line with the requirements of the statutory Consumer Protection Code 2012. Firms must take a consumer-focused approach in respect of any decision that affects their customers and to engage clearly, effectively, and in a timely manner with all customers. </p>  <p>  In June 2021 the Central Bank wrote to the main retail banks in Ireland to set out its expectations of the importance of considering consumers&rsquo; interests in decision-making during this period of unprecedented change in the retail banking sector in Ireland. The Central Bank is closely monitoring banks&rsquo; compliance with its expectations through ongoing supervisory engagement and review. This includes the expectation that the quality of service to customers by firms is in line with the firm&rsquo;s expectations and the firms&rsquo; own internal service level standards. </p>  <p>  The letter sets out the Central Bank's expectations in relation to a range of issues including: </p>  <p>  - Demonstrating a customer-focused culture, ensuring fair treatment of customers and ensuring that customers understand what the changes mean for them.</p>  <p>  - Being transparent and clear in communications, communicating effectively and in a timely manner with all affected customers across all channels (e.g. in person, advisory, digital etc.), providing customers with sufficient information and avoiding risks around information overload.</p>  <p>  - Providing as much notice as possible on account closures, product/service withdrawals etc.</p>  <p>  - Consider specifically the impact of their decisions on vulnerable customers and provide the assistance necessary to reasonably mitigate those impacts and retain access to basic financial services.</p>  <p>  Further, in light of the changing landscape for banking in Ireland I have instructed my Department to undertake a broad-ranging review of the retail banking sector. The Retail Banking Review has commenced its work and is currently in its research phase. As part of the Review, a survey of consumers will be undertaken in the coming months to ascertain their experience and perceptions of the retail banking sector in Ireland. </p>  <p>  There will also be a public consultation process this year where members of the public can make a submission to the Department of Finance on issues that fall within the Terms of Reference. </p></reply>

The reliefs include an individual exemption of the first &euro;1,270 of gains in a calendar year, as well as a range of other reliefs including principal private residence relief, retirement relief and revised entrepreneurs relief.

This approach was adopted to ensure that payments reached recipients as quickly as possible, given the suddenness of the pandemic and in the expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out not to be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  From 2021, the mechanism to tax the PUP, in common with other Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments, including Jobseekers&rsquo; Benefit and Illness Benefit, is to reduce the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands, ensuring as far as possible, that the right amount of tax is collected at the right time thereby preventing arrears building up. Where employees return to work following PUP, they are placed on a Week 1 basis to minimise potential financial hardship and prevent any further underpayments arising in the year. </p>  <p>  Where tax liabilities (including PUP) still existed for 2020 after all additional tax credits such as health expenses were applied, the outstanding balance is automatically collected interest free over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing the employee&rsquo;s tax credits. For employees that have an overpayment on record for 2021, the amount due is automatically offset to the underpayment for previous years. This is normal practice to ensure the taxpayer&rsquo;s overall tax position is rectified as soon as possible, allowing restoration of full tax credits.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that taxpayers engaging a tax agent do so at their own discretion and any commission paid is a matter between both parties. Revenue has also confirmed that it provides a comprehensive range of online services for taxpayers to self-manage their tax affairs. These services, which include an online communication channel through the MyEnquiries system, are available 24/7, are easy to use, are fully secure and, in most cases, remove the need to contact Revenue or engage a tax agent. </p>  <p>  For taxpayers whose tax affairs are more complex and require direct engagement, Revenue provides a one to one appointment service with the relevant official. These engagements can be carried out remotely by video conferencing if required. Such an appointment can be arranged by contacting Revenue at 01-738 3660 from 09.30 to 13.30 (Monday to Friday).</p></reply>

If a customer of a regulated firm is not satisfied with how the regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm.

However, proof of the vehicle&rsquo;s status in NI prior to 1 January 2021 will be required. </p><p>For example:</p><p>- A ferry ticket showing the date of arrival in NI, and which clearly identifies the specific vehicle</p><p>- A copy of an invoice from a transport company identifying the vehicle and delivery date</p><p>- Tax and insurance details indicating use in NI</p><p><b>or</b></p><p><b>- </b>A copy of the V5C showing the last registered keeper in NI and a date of registration to that keeper prior to 1 January 2021.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that where a second hand vehicle is imported from GB after 1 January 2021 and the Customs formalities were completed in Northern Ireland, the person wishing to register the vehicle in Ireland should first contact Revenue as there will be a VAT liability that needs to be discharged prior to registering the vehicle for VRT. This measure was introduced as a result of a UK decision to allow the VAT margin scheme to apply to imports of vehicles from GB to NI. A &lsquo;Supplementary Import Declaration &ndash; VAT on import&rsquo; must be made to Revenue in respect of the VAT margin scheme and qualifying vehicle being imported from NI. Revenue will request verification that the Customs formalities have been completed in NI. Once the VAT, which is charged at the standard rate, is either paid or accounted for (in the case of VAT registered businesses only), Revenue will provide the necessary documentation to the customer for presentation to the NCT centre. </p><p>There are two methods of calculating the VAT:</p><p>- For vehicles purchased directly from a NI dealer:  VAT is charged on the VAT inclusive value shown on the invoice issued by the NI dealer. No additional costs are added for cost of transport and Customs duties because these costs will already be included in the price charged by the NI dealer. </p><p>- For vehicles purchased from GB and imported to Ireland via NI by the same person:  VAT is charged on the Customs value of the vehicle i.e. the VAT inclusive value shown on the invoice issued by the dealer plus transport costs to the point of importation plus Customs duties paid.</p><p>This is a temporary arrangement until the situation regarding VAT at importation is regularised for vehicles imported from GB to NI. This is currently being discussed between the European Commission and the UK Government. </p><p>If proof cannot be provided that Customs formalities have been completed in NI for used vehicles where they have been previously imported from GB to NI since 1 January 2021, then an import declaration is required in Ireland. Under the provisions of the EU - UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, if the imported vehicle is of UK origin, then a preferential tariff rate of 0% Customs duty applies. However, where the vehicle is not of UK origin, Customs duty at a rate of 10% of the value of the vehicle is applicable to the importation.  The value of the goods on which VAT is levied at the point of importation is the Customs value of the vehicle. The Customs value consists of the purchase price of the vehicle, plus transport and insurance costs, any handling charges and the Customs duty amount payable on the vehicle. Vehicles are liable to VAT at the standard rate. Finally, Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is payable on the open market selling price of the vehicle at registration, with the VRT calculation and collection being undertaken by the NCT centres.</p></reply>

Landlords are entitled to deduct certain expenses from the gross rental income received and are then taxed on the balance, which is the rental profit.  Generally, expenses which are capital in nature are not allowable as deductions unless they fall into the category of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; for the purposes of section 284 TCA 1997.  However, the expense must have been incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business of letting the property.  </p><p><b>Expenses</b></p><p>Section 97 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) provides the principal rules for the computation of profits/gains chargeable under Case V of Schedule D.  Allowable expenses include:</p><p>- rents paid for property such as ground rents</p><p>- insurance premiums against fire and public liability</p><p>- maintenance of the property such as cleaning, painting and decorating</p><p>- property fees before the property is first rented out, such as management, advertising, legal or accountancy fees</p><p>- the cost of any service or goods provided by the landlord that are not repaid by the tenant (such as electricity, central heating, telephone, service charges, water and refuse collection).</p><p>- certain mortgage protection policy premiums</p><p>- expenses in between renting out the property in certain circumstances</p><p>- capital allowances</p><p>- repairs, such as rot treatment, mending windows, doors or machines</p><p>- certain pre-letting expenses on vacant residential property</p><p>- the cost of registering with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).</p><p><b>Pre-letting expenditure</b></p><p>Section 97A TCA provides that expenses incurred on a vacant residential premises prior to it being first let after a period of non-occupancy are authorised as a deduction against rental income from that premises.  The section applies to expenditure on a premises which has been vacant for at least 12 months and must have been incurred in the 12 months before it is let as a residential premises.  The expenditure must be such as would be allowed against rental income if it had been incurred during the period of letting.  The deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises.  I extended this deduction for a further three years to 31 December 2024 in the Finance Act 2021.</p><p><b>Capital Allowances</b></p><p>Generally, expenditure on a property which is capital in nature is not deductible when computing taxable profits, other than where a landlord has incurred capital expenditure on the provision of &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; or &ldquo;plant&rdquo; as defined in section 284(1) TCA.  Such allowable expenditure is known as capital allowances, or &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo; allowances.  There is no exhaustive list as to what can be considered &ldquo;plant&rdquo; and the decision as to what constitutes plant remains primarily one of fact.  Case law has also set out certain factors which may be considered when determining whether an expense is plant. </p><p>Capital allowances are provided for in section 284 TCA. The allowance is given for a chargeable period where at the end of the chargeable period the machinery or plant belongs to the person and is wholly and exclusively in use for trade purposes.  </p><p>The rate at which wear and tear allowances on machinery and plant are claimed has changed over time.  Prior to 2001, the allowances were claimed over seven years (15% of the actual cost per year for six years and 10% in the final year).  Finance Act 2001 changed the period to five years at 20% of the actual cost per year.  Finance Act 2003 changed the period to eight years, at 12.5 per cent of the actual cost per year.  </p><p>Capital allowances are available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings (furniture, kitchen appliances, etc.) provided by a lessor for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation.  The allowances are available only where the expenditure is incurred wholly and exclusively in respect of a house used solely as a dwelling which is, or is to be, let as a furnished house on bona fide commercial terms in the open market.</p><p><b>Retrofitting and deductions</b></p><p>The Government last week approved the National Retrofitting Scheme, which is a package of supports to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills.  The scheme will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Retrofitting a property would involve expenses that should be considered on a case by case basis as to whether they constitute plant for the purposes of claiming capital allowances.  What constitutes qualifying plant in one case may not be plant in another, as has been determined in case law.  Also, in the event that a grant is received by the person incurring the expenditure, no part of the cost to which the grant relates could be deducted either as an expense or a capital allowance when computing taxable rental profits, as the portion of the cost to which the grant relates would not have been incurred by the claimant.  </p><p><b>Accelerated wear and tear allowances for certain energy efficient equipment </b></p><p>Section 285A TCA provides for accelerated capital allowances for expenditure on certain energy-efficient equipment bought for the purposes of the trade.  An accelerated wear and tear allowance of 100% of the capital expenditure incurred can be claimed in the year in which the equipment is first provided and used. The incentive runs until 31 December 2023. It applies to certain classes of technology that are listed in the Table to Schedule 4A TCA, which include &ldquo;heating and electricity provision&rdquo;, &ldquo;process and heating, ventilation&rdquo; and &ldquo;building energy management systems&rdquo;.However, accelerated capital allowances are not available against rental income taxable under Case V; they can only be claimed by taxpayers carrying on a trade.</p><p>Regarding the specific questions raised by the Deputy, there are no particular plans in place to examine the measures along the lines mentioned by him in relation to the rental sector.  Also, consistent with my Departments Tax Expenditure Guidelines, to the extent that a system of direct grant expenditure might be in place to encourage retrofitting it would on the face of it reduce the case for any further incentive measures to be put in place through the tax system. </p></reply>

Revenue&rsquo;s compliance activities in this area include roadside sampling of private and commercial vehicles at checkpoints combined with a risk-based, targeted sampling programme based on supply chain reporting obligations for suppliers and retailers. These activities leverage the benefits of the joint initiative of Revenue and HMRC in April 2015 of introducing a new marker for use in marked fuels.</p><p>The number of samples of Marked Gas Oil drawn and the consequential detections of misused fuel for the years 2020 and 2021 and to 31 January for 2022 are set out in the following table: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Samples Drawn</th>       <th>Misuse Detections<br /><br /></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>7,244</td>       <td>264</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>22,787</td>       <td>466</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>End January 2022</td>       <td>3,673</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am further advised that Revenue conducted a national oil random sampling programme in 2016 to 2019 to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The results for all four years of the sampling programmes are summarised in the report of the 2019 programme published at: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/oil-sampling-programme-2019.pdf.</p><p>The results for 2019 provide confirmation of the effectiveness of the various measures introduced by Revenue in recent years to enhance compliance in the fuel trade and among users of diesel. The random sampling programme results do not signify the complete elimination of the illicit trade in fuel; however, they demonstrate that systematic selling of illicit fuel through retail outlets and its use in the transport sector is negligible.</p><p>Despite the success in combating the misuse of fuel, I am assured by Revenue that tackling such criminality continues to be a priority. Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against cross-border fuel crime and co-operate with their counterparts in Northern Ireland under the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups who operate across jurisdictions and are responsible for much of this criminal activity.</p></reply>

Imported goods are liable to VAT at the same rate as applies to similar goods sold within the State. They also require a Customs import declaration which is made using Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Automated Import System (AIS). VAT registered traders may take credit for VAT paid on goods imported for the purposes of their business. This credit must be claimed in their VAT return in the taxable VAT period concerned.</p>  <p>  To avoid payment at point of import, Postponed Accounting for VAT on imports is available to traders that are registered for VAT and Customs and Excise. The trader needs to fulfil certain conditions and the importer should enter a code on the import declaration indicating that they are using Postponed Accounting. This code will allow the VAT on import liability to be accounted for by the importer in their next VAT Return. </p>  <p>  From 1 July 2021, the VAT de minimis of &euro;22 was removed across the EU, meaning all goods imported into the EU are liable for VAT.  These new VAT rules, which apply in all EU Member States, ensure that goods imported from outside the EU no longer have a preferential VAT treatment compared to goods purchased from within the EU, including from Irish retailers.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that a zero rate of VAT applies to exports which for VAT purposes, are goods directly dispatched to a destination outside the EU VAT area including Great Britain. Traders must ensure that the goods have left the EU and have evidence of export. In addition, each export requires a Customs export declaration.

In addition, since 1 July 2021, the VAT exemption for imported goods with a value of &euro;22 or less was removed. From that date, all goods arriving into the EU from non-EU countries, regardless of their value, are subject to VAT. The applicable VAT rate for imports into Ireland is the relevant rate that would apply if the goods were purchased in Ireland. These new VAT rules ensure that goods imported from non-EU countries no longer have a preferential VAT treatment compared to goods purchased within the EU, including from Irish retailers. </p>  <p>  In order to simplify the procedures for the importation of low value consignments, the EU introduced a scheme, where retailers in non-EU countries can register for the Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) which provides for the collection of VAT at the point of sale rather than at the point of import. The majority of large retailers in non-EU countries including in the UK, have signed up for this scheme. However, where the retailer has not signed up to the IOSS, then VAT is payable on import into Ireland regardless of the amount due. </p>  <p>  Consumers should always check if any additional taxes and charges, payable on goods purchased from outside the EU including from the UK, have been included in the price displayed online. That way they should be able to avoid being presented with unexpected charges at a later stage. </p>  <p>  Neither my Department nor Revenue have a role to play in the regulation of fees charged by businesses who deliver goods to an importer. That is a commercial arrangement between the business concerned and the importer. These businesses do not act on behalf of, nor do they collect the relevant taxes and duties on behalf of Revenue, but rather they act on the behalf of the importer and assist the importer in the correct clearance of their goods imported from outside the European Union.</p></reply>

This is a well established and broadly accepted principle. </p>  <p>  Section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, sets out that tax under Schedule E shall be charged in respect of every public office or employment of profit.   In addition, Section 112 of the TCA 1997 brings into charge all salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits of any kind arising from an office or employment.  Therefore, the long-standing position is that all tips, gratuities and service charges arising from an office or employment are chargeable to income tax under Schedule E in accordance with Section 112.  </p>  <p>  Gratuities from customers for example, service charges in hotels or tips in restaurants, paid to the employer and subsequently paid out to an employee should be included in pay for the income tax week or month in which they are paid out. These tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system.  The employer is not required to provide a separate breakdown to Revenue detailing these amounts. </p>  <p>  However, in a situation where an employee receives tips directly from customers, the employer is not obliged to operate PAYE and in that case, the tips and gratuities are fully taxable and should be included by the employee in his or her income tax return.  It is important to point out that such tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system.  Where such income is declared by employees themselves, there is no requirement that it be itemised separately from other forms of income on the relevant tax returns. </p>  <p>  Therefore, I am advised by Revenue that is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy as regards the precise amount received by Exchequer in the form of tips, gratuities and service charges, from Revenue data. </p>  <p>  As referenced by the Deputy in his question, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is progressing legislation on tips and gratuities and this legislation will prohibit the practise of using tips or gratuities to top up wages.  It will also ensure that electronic tips and gratuities, which are much more common these days, have to be divided fairly and equitably among the staff. In addition, the legislation will provide transparency to customers so they will know what the policy is on tips and service charges, how they are managed and to whom they go.  </p>  <p>  For the reasons outlined in the opening paragraphs of my reply, I have no plans to amend the tax treatment of tips and gratuities. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, I am also unable to comment on individual cases.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government recognises that the cost of insurance remains a significant issue for many groups, including community and voluntary organisations. The Government is therefore pursuing a broad range of measures through the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in order to improve both the affordability and availability of this key financial service, including for such groups.</p>  <p>  One of the key developments under the insurance reform agenda has been the creation of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, chaired by Minister of State Fleming. The Office aims to both improve costs and increase the availability of cover by encouraging greater competition in the Irish market. Since its establishment, the Office has held over 60 meetings with a wide range of stakeholders on issues surrounding competition. Officials are also working with IDA Ireland to leverage the ongoing reform work in order to attract potential new market entrants here, and are identifying targets to engage with. This will, in the first instance, seek out providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Government is committed to ensuring that the benefit of the various reforms being implemented, notably the new Personal Injuries Guidelines, are passed onto customers. In this regard, Minister of State Fleming recently met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in November to discuss a variety of issues, including expanding insurers&rsquo; risk appetite in underserved areas, such as those raised by the Deputy. Furthermore, he has also met with insurance providers who are seeking to expand their cover here.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, this Government is committed to improving both the cost and availability of insurance in Ireland through continued implementation of the current reform agenda. With regard to community centres, upcoming priorities of particular note including making changes to the duty of care, and legislating with a view to increasing the number of claims settled by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. It is my intention to continue working with colleagues across Government to help to deliver these key actions and to ensure that the overall implementation of the Action Plan leads to a more competitive and sustainable insurance market.</p></reply>

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within Annex III of the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates of VAT.</p>  <p>  However, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%, to a range of services under what is known as a 'parked rate'. The continuation of these parked rates is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland maintains a zero VAT rate on certain items under a derogation from EU VAT law which allows Member States to retain certain zero rates for goods and services which were expressly covered in their national VAT legislation on 1 January 1991.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s current application of VAT rates has for the most part been preserved through the retention of historical derogations and exemptions or through the expansion of Annex III of the VAT Directive. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will be reviewing the options now available to Ireland in setting VAT rates.</p>  <p>  Future tax changes are generally taken in the context of the Budget.

In most cases, a lender is legally required under section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to make sure that a mortgage applicant has mortgage protection insurance in place before granting a mortgage loan.  </p>  <p>  This is an important statutory provision which is designed to protect the borrower's dependants and their home should the borrower die before the mortgage has been repaid.  However, the Act also recognises that in certain cases such protection is not necessary or would be inappropriate and it provides for a number of limited exemptions to this statutory obligation such as where the borrower belongs to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to a life insurer, or would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally.</p>  <p>   In such circumstances, there is no statutory requirement on a mortgage lender to arrange for mortgage protection insurance and it is then a matter of the lender&rsquo;s own internal policy to decide on whether or not it wishes to ensure that such a policy is in place.  This will be a commercial decision as opposed to a statutory requirement for an individual mortgage lender, and it is not possible for me to instruct lenders on their individual lending policies.  </p>  <p>  However, if a person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, including the requirement for the regulated entity to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers, the consumer can also complain directly to the regulated entity and, if they are not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. </p>  <p>  With regard to any intervention by the State to provide insurance in these circumstances, I would be cautious about the introduction of a State-backed insurance scheme in this jurisdiction generally, for a number of reasons.  </p>  <p>  Firstly, any State insurance scheme would be required to comply with the same prudential rules under the Solvency II Directive as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost would still have to reflect the risk involved.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, there is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing risks than private firms, and therefore be in a position to provide insurance more affordably.  </p>  <p>  Thirdly, such an approach could actually decrease competition, with insurers potentially discontinuing certain lines if there is a view the State will insure these risks instead.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, any such proposals for State intervention, while well intended and which may appear as representing an easy solution, are likely to lead to unintended consequences. Accordingly, I am not convinced that a State-backed insurance scheme would be a solution to either the cost or availability of mortgage protection insurance.</p></reply>

This allowed Member States to request early disbursement of funding up to a maximum of 13% of their overall allocation. For Ireland, this would have amounted to pre-financing of &euro;129 million from our overall allocation of &euro;915 million.</p>  <p>  The level of pre-financing available to Member States was dependent on the amount of money that the European Commission was in a position to raise during mid-2021 on the markets. Indications during this time were that the European Commission expected to raise approximately &euro;40 billion, and that this would not be sufficient to meet demand if all Member States were to request the maximum allowable 13%.</p>  <p>  The Department was aware that a number of Member States with a worse economic outlook than Ireland, or which had been more severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic than Ireland, intended to request the maximum amount of pre-financing available to them under the terms of the Regulation.</p>  <p>  Ireland's 2021 Summer Economic Statement noted an environment of increasingly positive economic indicators, with high frequency data on consumer expenditure and job postings show signs of a strong economic recovery taking hold in line with the easing of public health restrictions at that time. Q1 2021 data showed very strong GDP growth rate for Ireland and it was clear at that time that the level of GDP for Ireland would be higher than anticipated. On this basis, the Department incorporated an upward revision to its GDP projection for 2021 to 8&frac34; per cent, and revenues revised upwards by &euro;1.6 billion relative to projections.</p>  <p>  In that context, and given the small overall size of Ireland's Recovery and Resilience Plan, comparatively with our European colleagues, Ireland took the decision not to seek pre-financing so as not to impact or deprive other Member States who were more severely impacted by the pandemic of the opportunity to avail of their maximum pre-financing amount.</p></reply>

Any extension to the response time is usually due to queries which may arise in relation to the personal identification information provided by the lender.

Any decision by an individual to produce their credit report to a third party is solely a matter between the individual and that third party. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank advises that recent increases in activity by borrowers are likely to be as a consequence of increased awareness of the CCR and a possible knock-on effect of the cessation of the Irish Credit Bureau in late 2021. The processing of individual credit report applications is an operational CCR matter. However, the Central Bank advises that the time required to provide a credit report to a borrower is approximately three weeks and that efforts are underway to increase resources with a view to reducing this timeline.  </p></reply>

These include various tax-exempted child-care related supports provided by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and measures such as the Working Family Payment provided by the Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>In relation to direct expenditure measures, Budget 2022 announced the introduction of a number of measures to support parents in respect of childcare costs, including:  </p><p>- The universal subsidy of the National Childcare Scheme will be extended to children of all ages.</p><p>- There will be a change to the practice of deducting hours spend in the Early Childhood Care and Education pre-school programme or school from the entitlement to subsidised hours of care.</p><p>- A new Core Funding stream will come into effect from September 2022 which will require participating providers to maintain their fee levels at or below September 2021 levels.  </p><p>This will ensure that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme, and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, are felt by parents. </p><p>With regard to taxation measures, and separate to the above: </p><p>- The Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Childcare Services was introduced to encourage employers to develop childcare facilities onsite for their employees.  </p><p>- Individuals who provide child-minding services in their own home may claim childcare services relief each year, provided that they do not receive more than &euro;15,000 income per annum from the child-minding income.</p><p>- Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.  </p><p>In relation to the specific question raised by the Deputy, I do not have any plans currently to add to the measures currently in place by making childcare costs tax deductible. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-15a.719.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022021500068#WRQ04000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 and 304 together.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, I introduced a Committee stage amendment to  section 604 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in the 2021 Finance Act which provides that where an individual disposes of their principal primary residence by way of a lottery or game with prizes, any gain over the market value of the property is subject to Capital Gains Tax. During the preparation of this amendment as well as during the passage of the Finance Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas, my officials engaged with officials from both Revenue and the Department of Justice in relation to this provision in order to ensure that it was not contrary to Department of Justice policy and legislation in this general area.</p><p>I would note that this amendment affects only the disposal of a principal primary residence through a game or lottery and the winner of a such prize is not subject to CGT on their winnings.</p><p>The practice of raffles or lotteries being run by different organisations, mostly community-based (including sports clubs and local schools), to generate funds for their activities has been commonplace for many years.  Increasingly, the practice has extended to a situation where a real asset, such as a car or a house, is put forward as the prize for the winner rather than a cash sum. </p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Deputy&rsquo;s question requires consideration across a number of tax heads, as set out below.</p><p><b>Stamp Duty </b></p><p>From the description provided, it is not clear whether there will be a transfer of a house from the developer to the sports club and a subsequent transfer to the raffle winner, or a transfer directly from the developer to the raffle winner. However, I can advise that the transfer of a property (including a house) constitutes a conveyance on sale for the purposes of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999. Stamp duty is payable by the transferee, whether or not it was transferred by way of sale, gift or as a result of winning a raffle. Where a property is sold, or otherwise transferred, for less than market value, section 30 SDCA 1999 imposes a charge to stamp duty at the market value of the property.  </p><p>Stamp duty on transfers of residential property is chargeable at the rate of 1% where the market value does not exceed &euro;1 million. Where the market value exceeds &euro;1 million, stamp duty is chargeable at 1% on the first &euro;1 million and 2% on the balance in excess of &euro;1 million.  </p><p><b>Capital Acquisitions Tax</b></p><p>In the normal course of events, a charge to capital acquisitions tax (CAT) arises on the gifting of assets between individuals or groups of individuals. The beneficiary of the asset being transferred is liable for this charge. Notwithstanding this, section 76(2) of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides that a gift or inheritance taken for public or charitable purposes is exempt from tax and is not taken into account in computing tax, to the extent that Revenue is satisfied that it has been, or will be, applied for purposes which in accordance with the laws of the State are public or charitable. </p><p>While the CATCA 2003 does not provide a definition of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;, section 3 (1) of the Charities Act 2009 provides that each of the following shall be a charitable purpose: </p><p>- the relief of poverty</p><p>- the advancement of education</p><p>- the advancement of religion</p><p>- other purposes beneficial to the community.</p><p>Donations to local sports clubs are generally considered to be beneficial to the community and consequently a donation of a dwelling house by a local sports club for the purposes of fund raising would generally be exempt from CAT.  </p><p>On the matter of the transfer of the dwelling house to a winner of a raffle, section 82 CATCA 2003 provides for an exemption from CAT for certain types of receipts. Among these is the receipt of winnings from betting (including pool betting) or any lottery, sweepstake or game with prizes. Such winnings are exempt from CAT provided those winnings are received bona fide, i.e. the winnings are received from betting or games the outcome or which is not certain or cannot be controlled by either the organiser or the winner. Accordingly, provided the raffle is run by the local sports club in a bona fide manner, the receipt of the dwelling house by the winner will be exempt from CAT. </p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax</b></p><p>It is not clear from the description provided as to whether the property transferred is an investment property; however, it is assumed, based on the transferor being described as a developer, that the property is stock in the developer&rsquo;s trade, and not an investment asset. On this basis, no capital gains tax (CGT) consequences arise on the transfer of the property by the developer.</p><p>Should the property be transferred by the sports club to the prize winner, any gain arising on the transfer will be exempt from CGT, as charitable and sporting organisations may be exempt from CGT in respect of chargeable gains which arise on the disposal of their assets, should the gain arising on the disposal be applied to charitable purposes or for the purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports, in accordance with section 609 and/or section 610A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. </p><p>Winnings from betting, lotteries, sweepstakes or games with prizes are exempt from CGT, as are rights to winnings from those sources (for example, the sale of a bet), by virtue of section 613(2) TCA 1997. As such, no CGT liability arises for the prize winner on wining the property. If the prize winner subsequently disposes of the property, the base cost of the asset is its market value at the date it is acquired, and CGT will be calculated on any rise in value since it was acquired.</p><p><b>Income Tax/Corporation Tax</b></p><p>On the assumption that the property transferred by the developer is part of their stock in trade, the transfer will be reflected as a sale at cost in their accounts for the relevant accounting period; whether or not this cost may be deducted in arriving at taxable profits depends on whether the expense meets the requirement of having been incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the developer&rsquo;s trade. </p><p>Section 235 TCA 1997 provides an exemption from income tax or corporation tax, as appropriate, for bodies which are established and existing for the sole purpose of promoting:</p><p>- an athletic game or an athletic sport, or</p><p>- an amateur game or an amateur sport.</p><p>The exemption applies to that portion of the income of the &ldquo;approved body&rdquo; which has been or will be applied for the purpose of promoting an athletic or amateur game or sport. This means that if the proceeds of the raffle are applied for such purpose then the exemption should apply. However, each case would need to be considered based on its own facts.  </p><p><b>VAT</b></p><p>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply. Revenue&rsquo;s understanding of the transaction, from the details provided, is that a developer initially developed a property for sale which was then granted or given to a sports club as a prize for fundraising activities and where the developer did not receive consideration for the house.  In these circumstances and in accordance with VAT legislation the developer has diverted the property to a non-business use which is known as a 'self-supply'. As this is the first supply of the property by the developer, it is, therefore, a taxable supply and, in simple, terms, the value of the self-supply is the cost incurred by the developer in relation to the property. The net effect of the rule is that where a property is diverted to a non-business use there is a claw-back of the VAT that had been deducted on the acquisition or development of the property. </p></reply>

The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays &ldquo;qualifying fees&rdquo; for an approved course whether on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another individual. Claimants who pay tuition fees in instalments can claim tax relief either in the tax year when the academic year commenced or the tax year when the instalment is paid.</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Qualifying fees&rdquo; mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &ldquo;student contribution&rdquo;. No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees. A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students. It should be noted that any claim for relief must be submitted within the 4-year time limit which applies to claiming tax reliefs. </p>  <p>  The maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per course per academic year.  In accordance with the governing legislation, an amount must be disregarded, whether the claim is in respect of one or more students. The disregarded amount per claim is currently &euro;3,000 in the case of a full-time course(s) and &euro;1,500 for a part time course(s). One disregard amount applies to each claim.</p>  <p>  Issues relating to the direct cost of further and higher education are ones primarily for the Minister for Further and Higher Education in the first instance and I am aware that this is an area of particular focus for Minister Harris at present. </p>  <p>  However, in relation to the specific issue raised in the Deputy's question, I do not have any plans currently in relation to the removal of the disregard mentioned. </p></reply>

A number of strategic properties or sites are retained in anticipation of potential State use/development in line with service demands arising from Government policy changes to public service provision.  As a matter of policy, no property or site is disposed of until there is absolute certainty that there is no alternative State use for that property or site.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that the site in question was acquired in part to secure long-term car parking for the Government Offices at Caltragh, because the lease on the car park was due to expire in 2024 with no guarantee that the Office of Public Works (OPW) would be able to renew the lease.  In purchasing the site and buying out the lease, the OPW will have paid for the site in lease savings in less than six years.</p>  <p>  In addition, the remainder of the site was identified as a potential location for a new facility for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS).  As this facility is no longer required by AGS, the OPW will firstly consider options for facilities that may be required by its clients at the location.</p>  <p>  If no alternative facilities are considered feasible for its clients, the OPW will engage with other State Bodies including the Department of Education, the Land Development Agency, Sligo County Council and the HSE.  This will be for the purposes of determining potential alternative State uses for the site.  </p></reply>

These include:</p><p>- <b>EU Farm to Fork Strategy:</b>The Commission will be revising food contact materials legislation to improve food safety and public health (in particular in reducing the use of hazardous chemicals), support the use of innovative and sustainable packaging solutions using environmentally-friendly, re-usable and recyclable materials, and contribute to food waste reduction.</p><p>- <b>Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability</b>: The Commission is proposing a set of actions to address the use of and contamination with PFAS. This includes a commitment to address PFAS with a group approach, under relevant legislation on water, sustainable products, food, industrial emissions, and waste. EU member states endorsed the Strategy&rsquo;s goal in 2020, approving Council Conclusions that called for PFAS-containing products to be allowed only if their use is proven to be essential.</p><p>- <b>Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive</b>: The review of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive is ongoing, in particular around essential requirements, which may include measures to deal with compostable packaging, mandating recycled content in plastic packaging, reuse, prevention and restricting substances of concern. The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) will be actively engaging in the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive review discussions.</p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) established a framework in July 2021 for disposable catering consumables and meal containers that provides a wide range of compostable or sustainable products to the public service, in accordance with current legislation and regulations. The arrangement aims to help reduce the negative impact of certain plastic products on the environment, in particular marine life. </p><p>During the tender design research stage, the OGP engaged with a number of relevant stakeholders including manufacturers, the Environmental Protection Agency, DECC and the European Commission. The findings of these consultations led to a procurement strategy that required tenderers to submit either compostable or recyclable products to meet obligations, including those under the Single Use Plastics (SUP) Directive (EU) 2019/904. This was addressed in the specification of the products. </p><p>All disposable items supplied under the framework must be recyclable, or made of compostable material. The raw materials in these compostable products include wood, sugar cane, bamboo and coconut fibres, in compliance with European Regulations for food contact. </p><p>The Suppliers under this arrangement have certified that all natural plant-based (virgin fibres) products fully meet the European Regulations guidelines for the safe use of approved PFAS as an oil-repellent additive.</p></reply>

A Steering Group, comprising of representatives from the Office of Public Works and Cork County Council, is in place and is progressing this Flood Relief Scheme to protect some 198 properties.  </p>  <p>  The Bantry Flood Relief Scheme is being funded from the overall &euro;1.3 billion for flood risk management allocated by the Government under the National Development Plan to 2030.  </p>  <p>  During 2021 Cork County Council, in partnership with OPW, issued the tender documentation for the procurement of Engineering and Environmental Consultants to design a viable scheme for the town. An assessment of all tenders has now been completed by Cork County Council, and I am pleased to announce that on 3rd February last, the appointment took place of JB Barry and Partners Ltd. in joint venture with JBA Consulting Ltd. as engineering and environmental consultants to carry out the design of the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme.</p>  <p>  Now that they are appointed, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of this important scheme.</p>  <p>  In tandem with progressing this scheme, Cork County Council is preparing the consultants brief, that is expected to issue in the first quarter this year, to carry out the repair and re-construction of a culvert on Main Street. This culvert has been identified as a significant element contributing to flooding on Main Street, New Street and north and south of Wolfe Tone Square in recent months.  The OPW and Cork County Council are liaising on the integration of these works with the flood relief scheme for the town.</p>  <p>  In October 2021, my office approved &euro;101,578 and further additional funding of &euro;82,339 was approved in January 2022 bringing the total to &euro;183,917 in funding to Cork County Council. This was approved under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for interim works to mitigate flooding in Bantry. </p>  <p>  To date 2 pumps are on order following a tender process. The delivery timeline is approximately 3 months. Following a tender process a contract is now in place for the installation of non return valves. The valves are expected to be installed before the end of February 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above proposals, prior to forecasted extreme weather events, such as Storm Barra, local area staff from Cork County Council are implementing interim measures to assist in mitigating flooding, such as deployment of sandbags at Sands Quay and mobile pumping.</p>  <p>  While the provision of individual property flood gates by Cork County Council has not been identified at this time, as an interim measure the OPW will continue to liaise with Cork County Council  to explore further interim flood mitigation measures that may be appropriate until the flood relief scheme is complete.</p></reply>

However, the level of tax paid and-or the impact on a social welfare payment will depend on each person's individual circumstances. </p>  <p>  The means testing of social welfare payments is a statutory function of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys TD and I have no statutory role in that regard. Engagement on the pilot scheme has been ongoing between my Department and the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Basic Income for the Arts scheme is not a social welfare payment, it is a grant payment and is a pilot scheme to research the impact of a basic income for the arts.     </p>  <p>  I believe that the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector post pandemic and it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.</p></reply>

Production continued throughout 2021 despite the very great challenges of COVID-19.  Levels of employment across the industry have been particularly high. </p>  <p>  The Government has a range of measures to encourage activity in the audiovisual industry including the Section 481 tax relief and direct grant to projects from Screen Ireland and the Sound and Vision fund. </p>  <p>  The Government's Audiovisual Action Plan aims to provide the necessary environment for Ireland to become a global hub for the production of Film, TV drama and animation. The Plan recognises Section 481 as a vital part of the financial infrastructure of the audio-visual industry in Ireland and underlines the need to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and achieves its objectives.  My Department is in ongoing collaboration with the Department of Finance to ensure that the tax relief is kept up to date and in line with international incentives. </p>  <p>  Screen Ireland's mission is to support and promote Irish film, television and animation through fostering Irish artistic vision and our diverse creative and production talent, growing audiences, and attracting filmmakers and investment into the country.  The funding allocation for screen Ireland will increase in 2022 by &euro;6.65m compared to 2021. The total allocation for 2022 will be &euro;36.743 million - an increase of 22.1%. Screen Ireland&rsquo;s 3-year strategic Plan &lsquo;Building for a Creative Future 2024&rsquo; sets out how it plans to support this important sector including championing development that is national and sustainable, supporting Irish companies and an expanded workforce. Screen Ireland also wants to ensure large-scale mobile productions are enabled to complete their full project in Ireland, including valuable animation, post-production and Visual Effects (VFX) work. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) continues to develop and implement the broadcasting funding schemes that support an increase in the production and availability of diverse, innovative and culturally relevant Irish audio-visual content.  In 2020, &euro;15,769m was allocated by BAI to Sound and Vision projects.  In 2021, the equivalent figure was approximately &euro;16m. </p>  <p>  In December 2020, the trade union SIPTU and Screen Producers Ireland (SPI) announced a new Shooting Crew agreement.  The agreement covers pay rates for live-action films and TV production as well as working conditions. The new agreement, came into effect on 1 January 2021 and is reported to be working well and being observed by all parties. </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with the Central Statistics Office to deepen the statistical information collected on employment and activity in the Arts &amp;amp; Culture sectors and this has the potential to add to research and statistical analysis about the levels of employment and unemployment in the audiovisual sector and the various occupational categories within the industry. </p></reply>

The Code of Programme Standards developed by the BAI pursuant to section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out that broadcasters should exercise due care in broadcasting depictions and-or descriptions of violence in programme material. The Code also sets out that broadcasters shall have due regard to the appropriateness of and-or justification for, the inclusion of violent content in programme material.</p>  <p>  In regard to the portrayal of violence through social media, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will establish a multi-person Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, including an Online Safety Commissioner, dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, establish regulatory frameworks for online safety and the regulation of audiovisual media services, and transpose the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive.</p>  <p>  It will be the role of the Online Safety Commissioner to oversee the regulatory framework for online safety. As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how designated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms. </p>  <p>  In particular, online safety codes will ensure that designated online services take appropriate measures to reduce the availability of illegal content on their services. Such illegal content includes, for example, relevant offences under Coco&rsquo;s Law (The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020). It is intended that this will have the effect of reducing the availability, on designated online services, of intimate images which have been shared without consent and of threatening or grossly offensive communications about, or to, another person.</p>  <p>  Under the Bill, in the event of a failure to comply with a relevant online safety code, and subject to Court approval, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including through financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will also allow Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n to create guidance materials for providers of relevant online services. Such guidance materials may seek to protect children in particular, but also the general public, from harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content. The Bill provides for a definition of age-inappropriate online content, and references in particular, content which consists of realistic representations of gross or gratuitous violence or acts of cruelty. </p></reply>

It has &euro;730m available for funding from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund and a further &euro;750m can be raised in the market if required.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;835 million has been approved by HBFI to end December 2021. This constitutes approved funding for 3,729 new homes, consisting of 71 loan facilities, across 18 counties.  To date, 519 HBFI-funded units have already been completed and sold, with a further 1,359 contracted for sale or with sale agreed.</p>  <p>  Following the outbreak of Covid-19, HBFI temporarily widened its remit to allow it provide finance for larger prime residential projects finding it difficult to access development finance through the introduction of a new prime lending facility, the Momentum Fund. The Momentum Fund has provided &euro;274 million to fund five loan facilities and 1,018 homes. The end date for Momentum Fund approvals was 31 December 2021.</p>  <p>  HBFI currently offers five products including for developments under 10 units, for 10 units or above, Apartment Development, Social Housing and the Green Funding Project. The Department of Finance completed a strategic review of HBFI in May 2021. It concluded HBFI is impacting positively on the availability of development finance and should continue to operate at this time.</p></reply>

It included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme. Government approved the enhanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2Bn. The comprehensive changes include:</p>  <p>  - The current 90% maximum grant will be increased to a 100% grant  for all remediation options 1-5.</p>  <p>  - The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000. </p>  <p>  - The grant calculation methodology in respect of option 1 remediation will be based on a cost per square foot with grant costings to be set by my Department following receipt of information on up to date construction costs from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate grant rate for blockwork removal and  replacement following receipt of advice from SCSI. The SCSI will  be completely independent in their engagement with my Department on construction costs.</p>  <p>  - A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over  testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and  local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option  and grant amount for each home. </p>  <p>  - Alternative  accommodation  and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  - In  relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a second grant option, will be available for such a  home in the future if  blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work  subsequently proves  defective in accordance with the IS;465 standard.</p>  <p>  - A  new independent appeals process will be introduced.</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 will be available for essential immediate repair works recommended by a building professional as part of the Building Condition Assessment process.</p>  <p>  - The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used. Opportunities for the State to acquire such rental properties for social housing purposes  will also be examined.</p>  <p>  Full details in relation to the changes announced are available at the following link;</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e365e-minister-obrien-announces-enhancements-to-the-defective-concrete-block-scheme/</p>  <p>  I aim to bring the required primary legislation to give effect to the enhanced scheme before the Oireachtas as soon as possible with Spring 2022 being the indicative target timeline. </p>  <p>  In the immediate term I am making amendments to the Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020 which will allow for the recoupment of Engineer fees to homeowners who have applied for entry into the scheme. As part of these amended regulations, up to &euro;5,000 will be recoupable as an allowable cost under the scheme for essential immediate repair works which are deemed necessary by a homeowners engineer under a Building Condition Assessment report.  In addition I am making provision for an increase in the value of stage payments which can be claimed by homeowners prior to the final grant payment being drawn down.</p></reply>

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned.  The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern and are being taken very seriously.  It is important that we establish the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response on the best knowledge and evidence available. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at the local level.</p>  <p>My Department publishes a detailed monthly report on homelessness, based on data provided by housing authorities. The Report outlines details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities. The Reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:  www.housing.gov.ie/housing/homelessness/other/homelessness-data  </p>  <p>  While the information requested in respect of the number of deaths of homeless service users is not compiled in my Department, a pilot study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. This study is due to be completed shortly. The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, involves the review of approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to support all individuals experiencing homelessness.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in doing this.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities.  My Department does not fund any homeless services directly but contributes to the overall expenditure incurred by housing authorities in the provision of these services.</p><p>My Department does not have direct involvement in executive functions, such as procurement, carried out by a local authority.  Under Section 149 of the Local Government Act 2001, the Chief Executive of a local authority is responsible for the executive functions of the local authority, and for that purpose to manage and control generally, the administration and business of the authority, subject to law.</p><p>Audit and oversight of local government in Ireland is the responsibility of two organisations; the Local Government Audit Service (LGAS) and the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC).</p><p>The LGAS carries out an independent, external audit of each local authority, each year.  Recent audit reports concerning individual local authorities are available here; <i>www.gov.ie/en/policy/61d9b3-local-government/latest/</i></p><p>NOAC is the national independent oversight body for the local government sector in Ireland. It was established under the Local Government Reform Act 2014 to provide independent oversight of the local government sector (local authorities and associated bodies), including regional assemblies. NOAC has a broad range of functions, covering all local authority activities and involving the scrutiny of performance generally and financial performance specifically. NOAC also has a role in supporting best practice; overseeing implementation of national local government policy; and monitoring and evaluating implementation of corporate plans, adherence to service level agreements and public service reform by local government bodies. A Government Minister may also request that NOAC prepare a report relevant to its functions on any specified aspect of local government. Further information on NOAC and its publications are available at <i>www.noac.ie</i>. </p><p>Section 59 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also requires each local authority to establish an Audit Committee with 3 months of local elections.  The Act sets out the functions of such committees, which are to review financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures, foster the development of best practice in the internal audit function, review auditors&rsquo; reports and special reports, assess follow-up action by management, assess and promote efficiency and value for money, review risk management systems and make such recommendations to the authority as the committee considers appropriate in respect of such matters.</p></reply>

It covers a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support.  </p>  <p>  In addition, where a victim of domestic violence applies for social housing support in their own right while still a joint tenant, it is a matter for the relevant local authority to address the contractual issues arising in relation to the joint tenancy agreement. Accordingly, the household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.</p>  <p>  The guidance was introduced with the objective of supporting a partnership approach by statutory agencies in respect of the delivery of domestic violence services. This is particularly the case in relation to helping to prevent and reduce the occurrence of related homelessness and facilitating the provision of long-term accommodation for victims of domestic violence. This guidance continues to apply in providing direction to housing authorities in supporting the housing needs of victims of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above supports, a new protocol was established in 2020 when the Minister for Social Protection agreed to make rent supplement more accessible to victims of domestic violence.  This measure aims to ensure that they are not prevented from leaving their homes because of financial or accommodation difficulties.  </p></reply>

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme.</p><p>The 2021 Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme was a newly revised Retrofit Programme and last year was the first year of a ten year plan that is expected to grow to meet the Programme for Government retrofit commitment that calls for the 'retrofit' of 500,000 homes by 2030, of which, approximately 36,500 are expected to be local authority owned homes. It focuses on ensuring that the fabric of the home is upgraded and an energy efficient heating system is provided. This revised programme represented a &lsquo;deeper retrofit&rsquo; on what has been completed by local authorities in previous years.</p><p>An annualised breakdown of the funding provided under the Energy Efficiency Retrofit programme for the years 2013-2021, is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/668c1-energy-efficiency-retrofitting-programme-expenditure-output/</i></p><p>The Department also introduced a pilot Midlands Energy Retrofit Programme in 2020-2022, the details of which are found below.

One major output from my Department's Strategic Partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, was a Masterplan for the six National Parks and Nature Reserves. This provides a high level and integrated blueprint for the NPWS to invest in and better manage the parks and reserves network for conservation, biodiversity and visitor experience alike. In effect, it enables the aligning of conservation objectives of the parks and reserves network with increasing visitor appeal and numbers. </p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and recreation amenities, I continue to explore ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites in my care in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. </p><p>Barloge Creek forms part of Lough Hyne Nature Reserve. Lough Hyne is designated as a Special Area of Conservation -Lough Hyne Nature Reserve and Environs SAC, which is selected for three habitats listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive (Large shallow inlets and bays, Reefs and Submerged or partially submerged sea caves). Detailed site-specific conservation objectives have been published for these three habitats (<i>www.npws.ie/sites/default/files/protected-sites/conservation_objectives/CO000097.pdf</i>). The targets outlined in these objectives help to guide appropriate management of the site.</p><p>My Department has been funding research to determine the cause of the decline of sponge communities in Lough Hyne since 2018. The precise cause has not yet been determined, though there are already some signs of recovery. Further research is being funded until 2027 and management measures will be put in place, as and when the research indicates the appropriate steps to be taken.</p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie. </i></p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  </p><p>Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  </p><p>As matters currently stand, the owners of dwellings located within the counties of Kildare, Meath or Offaly or the administrative areas of Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, South Dublin County Council or Limerick City and County Council, are eligible to apply for remediation works under the scheme.</p><p>&euro;20m has been allocated in 2022 to cover the continued implementation of the pyrite remediation scheme. This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 280 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings.  This will bring to approx. &euro;186m the total funding provided under the scheme since 2014.</p><p>The latest figures available indicate that 3,075 applications have been received under Scheme and, so far, 2,535 dwellings have been included. A further 130 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, 99 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process and 311 applications were not successful. Of the 2,535 dwellings included, the works in respect of 2,309 are complete with the rest at various stages of progress.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities. </p>  <p>  The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for homeless services has been developed by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive on behalf of my Department to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided.  In general, the operation of emergency accommodation facilities is contracted out by local authorities, under service level agreements, to NGO partners involved in the delivery of homeless services.   </p>  <p>  Monitoring and inspection of services are an important element of the Framework, and are a matter for the individual local authorities. This Framework is consistent with Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) standards and seeks to ensure a minimum level of quality in the provision of temporary accommodation and related services for homeless persons. The standards give service providers a framework for continuous quality improvement in their services and include provisions concerning the accessibility of buildings to service users with common physical or sensory disabilities. </p>  <p>  The National Quality Standards Framework can be accessed at www.homelessdublin.ie/content/files/NQSF-Standards.pdf. </p>  <p>  The regional lead local authorities undertake monitoring and review activities to assure that services are operating effectively.</p></reply>

In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support. The borrower surrenders their property to their lender who sells it to a MTR provider which can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd. The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.  </p>  <p>  To the end of December 2021, 1,682 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013. The 1,682 households in the scheme represent 2,738 adults and 2,274 children who have remained living in their homes and communities. As of that date, 720 active cases were being progressed under the scheme. The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme on the Housing Agency's website at the following link: www.housingagency.ie/housing-information/mortgage-rent-statistics </p>  <p>  The Mortgage to Rent scheme is administered on the Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Housing Agency, who coordinate with all stakeholders to ensure each application meets the eligibility criteria. The scheme, by its very nature, involves multiple stakeholders and it is essential for the efficient operation of the scheme that all stakeholders complete their individual roles within the MTR process. Local authorities are one of these stakeholders and play a vital role within the Mortgage to Rent scheme. The local authorities assess the household to see if they are eligible for social housing support and also check certain aspects of the application including if the property is suitable for the scheme and if the rent stated is appropriate. </p>  <p>  A MTR scheme was also introduced for local authority borrowers and has been in place nationally since 2014. Under the scheme, a local authority can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as social housing tenants.  Information in relation to the Local Authority MTR scheme from its inception in 2013 to end 2020, broken down by local authority area, is available on my Department's website under the heading Local Authority Mortgage to Rent at the link below. During that period, a total of 532 households had benefited from the scheme. Information relating to 2021 will be made available shortly.  </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/collection/42d2f-local-authority-loan-activity/#local-authority-mortgage-to-rent-scheme > refer to the section &ldquo;Local Authority Mortgage to Rent scheme&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  Both MTR schemes are established parts of the overall suite of social housing options and are important parts of the mortgage arrears resolution process.</p></reply>

If more than one party is interested in buying the property, the lender will provide information to the borrower around the options available to them and the borrower will make the decision on who purchases the property. </p>  <p>  A review of the MTR scheme took place in 2017 and explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme. Along with introducing a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the MTR scheme, the review concluded that the financial model of the scheme at the time may not have been capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme. The review, taking account of capacity within the AHB sector given that sector's role in delivering ambitious targets around new social housing supply, recommended that alternative funding options, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment, be explored in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale. An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request was initiated by the Housing Agency in October 2017 inviting parties from the private sector to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model. The outcome from the EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector. </p>  <p>  The inclusion of an MTR provider from the private sector has had a positive impact on the number of completed cases since its entry into the scheme and up to the end December 2021, has facilitated 672 families (40% of all MTR cases) to stay in their homes. Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme. In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focused on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears. </p></reply>

It included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme. Government approved the enhanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2Bn. </p>  <p>  Changes included the grant calculation methodology in respect of option 1 remediation which will, under the enhanced scheme, be based on a cost per square foot with costings to be set by my Department following receipt of information on up to date construction costs from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). In the case of remediation options 2-5, a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate grant rate for blockwork removal and replacement following receipt of advice from SCSI. The SCSI will be completely independent in their engagement with my  Department on construction costs.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme does not make financial provision for upgrades to the home. Homeowners are not precluded from carrying out such upgrades under the scheme but the marginal cost of such works must be paid for by the homeowner. My Department has engaged with colleagues in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications in relation to the eligibility of DCB homeowners under the National Retrofitting Schemes run by SEAI. I can confirm that SEAI grants for retrofitting works are available to DCB homeowners on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to all homeowners and should, given the recent Government announcement of increased grant amounts being available to homeowners, go some way towards offsetting the cost of thermal upgrades to the home where these works are being carried out.</p></reply>

This successful campaign included two weeks of advertisements on radio and in national newspapers and is continuing at present with targeted advertisements in the Aviva Stadium for the duration of the Rugby 6 Nations encouraging citizens to renew their passports online.  </p>  <p>  This campaign appears to have contributed significantly to the large volume of passport applications received in recent weeks. In January 2022, the Passport Service received over 137,000 new passport applications. This is the highest volume of monthly applications ever received. The Passport Service estimates that up to 1.7 million passport applications will be received this year.</p>  <p>  In addition, whenever the opportunity arises I regularly emphasise the need for citizens to check their passport validity before booking travel and to apply for their passport in plenty of time. The assistance of Deputies in communicating these messages to constituents is appreciated.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently considering further measures which might be introduced to encourage citizens to check the validity of their passports in plenty of time before travel. These might include an automatic reminder notification that could be sent to passport holders in advance of their renewal date. There are a number of important factors to be considered, however, in relation to such a passport renewal reminder service including; GDPR constraints, changes in contact details due to length of time between passport renewals, and the sensitive handling of cases where the passport holder may have passed away since their last passport renewal.</p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service. Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system. The Passport Issuance and Processing System (PIPS) contract was signed in September 2021 and my Department is actively working with the vendor to outline the high level design of the new system. The implementation of a passport renewal reminder service is also under consideration in the development of the new system.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question relating to engagement with airlines, the Passport Service is a member of the National Air Transport Facilitation Committee chaired by the Department of Transport and continues to examine  effective ways of engaging with airlines on this matter.  A senior official from the Passport Service recently attended a meeting between my Department and the Irish Travel Agents Association (ITAA) and highlighted the importance of citizens checking the validity of their passport before booking travel. </p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.  The Passport Online Service is four times quicker than paper-based applications for adult and child renewal applications and is the fastest, easiest and safest way to apply for a passport. Over 90% of applicants now apply online compared to 47% of applications received online in 2019.</p>  <p>  Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.</p></reply>

The Passport Online Service was first launched in 2017 to facilitate adults renewing their passport.  This was expanded in 2018 to child renewals and again at the end of 2019 to first time applicants, irrespective of age both children and Adult in Ireland, UK, and all EU and EEA countries.  The most recent expansion was in 2021 which facilitated first time applications from USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. </p>  <p>  Further expansion will take place over the next 18 months to make the service available to all first time applicants.  South Africa will be the first country to benefit from this further expansion by the end of March while India and Japan are scheduled towards the end of 2022.  </p>  <p>  Currently 98% of passport applicants globally have access to the Passport Online service and it is four times faster than paper-based applications for adult and child renewal applications. Passport Online is the fastest, easiest and safest way to apply for a passport. Over 90% of applicants now apply online compared to 47% of applications received online in 2019.</p></reply>

This is the highest volume of monthly applications ever received and is as a direct result of the pent-up demand for passports following the relaxation of necessary travel restrictions due to the Covid pandemic. The Passport Service estimates that up to 1.7 million passport applications will be received this year.</p><p>My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.</p><p>My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been underway for several months. Since June of 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service. Additional staff are being assigned on a weekly basis with a goal of reaching staff numbers of 900 by the end of March. This represents a doubling of staff numbers over the course of 9 months.</p><p>The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the  turnaround times for passports and improve customer service:</p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications.</p><p>- The Passport Service is actively prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time.</p><p>- A new document management process is being put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. </p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service. Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system. Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p><p>Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA.

I note the publication of the detailed and comprehensive report issued on 1 February. I have asked my officials to review the detail of the report.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on these matters is &ndash; and will continue to be &ndash; based on international law including international human rights law, Israel&rsquo;s obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as the occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory, and on the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been consistently forthright in expressing concern regarding the unequal treatment of Palestinians and the application of different standards in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. We have been clear in the language we have used to describe the situation and are conscious of how the language we use can be interpreted. As the Taoiseach has stated clearly in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Government does not use the term &lsquo;apartheid&rsquo; as we do not think it is helpful. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to raise our concerns regarding discriminatory practices towards the Palestinian people on a regular basis directly with the Israeli authorities, including during visits to the region, as well as at EU and UN level. In particular, Ireland has been proactive in consistently highlighting these issues, including demolitions and settlement expansion, at the UN Security Council during our current term.</p>  <p>  As a member of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), Ireland is strongly committed to the fight against racism and religious intolerance. Ireland was supportive of the adoption by IHRA of the non-legally binding Working Definition of Antisemitism, which clearly states that, &ldquo;criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic&rdquo;. It is important to distinguish between criticism of Israeli government policy, which is not criticism of the Israeli people. I would underline that Ireland&rsquo;s position in relation to Israel or any other situation is based on international law including international human rights law.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU will continue to monitor actively developments on the ground and to convey our concerns frankly to the Israeli Government. We remain committed to a two-State solution, and will continue to work with partners to revive a political process in line with international law, which ensures equal rights and is acceptable to both parties.</p></reply>

These rights are transcribed directly into the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of coastal states.</p>  <p>  Under international law, including UNCLOS, states are entitled to carry out naval exercises in another state&rsquo;s EEZ.  It is not unusual for naval ships or vessels of other States to carry out training exercises within the Irish EEZ or to passage through this area. This is not in any way an infringement of our national territory. </p>  <p>  While foreign militaries are not obliged in most cases to inform the coastal authorities of their proposed activities, the Naval Service has collated some data in relation to encounters with foreign navies in the Irish EEZ over the past few years. However, I will not be releasing any specific details in relation to activities of foreign militaries that are held by the Naval Service. I can confirm that encounters with foreign militaries in the Irish EEZ include sightings, planned visits to Ireland and hailing for information gathering. </p>  <p>  Neither my Department or the Defence Forces would hold any data in relation to the issue of any warnings to the Irish fishing fleet, the Irish Coastguard, marine research, shipping and airline companies operating in an area potentially impacted by a foreign military exercising.</p></reply>

Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the Department of Defence, but compensation received from any other source is not excluded.  </p>  <p>  The provisions do not apply to Disability Pension cases related solely to disablement due to disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with the United Nations. They apply only to wound pension cases involving wound or injury or where disease is secondary to wound or injury.</p>  <p>  There are currently 1,011 Disability Pensions of all categories in payment, of which 275 in relation to injury/wound pensions have had a reduction under S.13 (2) applied. </p>  <p>  There have been a number of key cases both at Supreme and High Court levels involving Section 13(2) and the procedures in place in relation to individual cases take account of these judgements. The Courts, in various judgements, have upheld the Minister&rsquo;s statutory right to take into consideration that part of the damages which can properly be regarded as general damages or that part which can properly be regarded as referable to loss of earnings, as he considers proper. </p>  <p>  The reduction of these Disability Pensions is not arbitrary; it is provided for under legislation and is done on foot of a bona fide decision by the Minister after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the individual case. The person or his/her solicitor is advised of the statutory provisions and of the potential implications for his/her application. Representations are invited regarding, in particular, the person's circumstances, details of the compensation actually received, and whether there are any special or extenuating circumstances involved. </p>  <p>  On receipt of representations, each case is submitted to the Minister for decision, together with the relevant facts of the case, including details of the representations made and an actuarial assessment (in pension only cases) of the compensation received. An actuarial assessment translates the compensation into an annuity value using various actuarial assumptions. </p>  <p>  Full account is then taken of representations made and the annuity value of the compensation received before a final decision is made personally by the Minister. Once fixed, the value of any reduction decided by the Minister does not change over time, however, the Disability Pension itself increases over time in line with relevant pay increases.</p>  <p>  Implementation of this statutory provision does not attempt to reverse the decision of the Courts and only comes into play when someone has received double compensation in respect of the same wound or injury, i.e. both compensation (from any source) and a Disability Pension or gratuity from my Department.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that &lsquo;Section 13(2)&rsquo; is applied appropriately and there are no plans to discontinue or review the application of this statutory provision.</p></reply>

By offering all primary and post-primary schools the opportunity to run a school-based programme, it is to reduce the need for parents to have to rely on the home-based programme. </p>  <p>   However, my Department acknowledges not all schools are in a position to offer a programme. Therefore, a home-based programme is made available for students with complex special educational needs where a place on a school-based programme is not available to them. </p>  <p>  Under the home-based strand where the school is not available to open to run a summer programme, parents engage the services of a teacher or an SNA in a private arrangement. Parents can utilise their allocated hours over the summer holidays and with the flexibility to use the hours on non-consecutive weeks which best suits their needs. </p>  <p>   Preliminary work has commenced on the 2022 summer programme. The aim for this year is to make the programmes as accessible as possible, particularly to continue attract more schools to run the school-based programme, but also to make the overall experience simpler for parents, teachers and schools. As part of the consultation and planning process my Department will be looking at what worked well in 2021 and what can be improved on for 2022.</p></reply>

In addition, there are specialist educational supports provided by the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to help schools provide an appropriate education for pupils with special educational needs including reading difficulties.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to expand Reading Schools at this time. </p>  <p>  NCSE is currently undertaking Policy Advice on Education Provision in Special Classes and Special Schools to examine whether placement in specialist settings brings about improved educational outcomes and experiences, relative to their ability, for students with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  This Policy Advice is to be completed shortly and will then be considered by my Department. </p>  <p>  I have also requested my Department to arrange for a review of the policy on reading classes and schools.  When received, this report will also be considered in the context of planning future provision.</p>  <p>   The Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with Specific Learning Disability (SLD); of which Dyslexia is one such SLD, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for the provision of special educational needs supports to schools. </p>  <p>  The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's present or future educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  All Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to cater for children with special educational needs, including pupils with dyslexia.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching. This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have been published on Gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/56c43-supporting-pupils-and-students-with-special-educational-needs-guidelines-for-schools/ Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services.  </p>  <p>  Educational Psychologists from the Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work with schools using a problem solving model to help schools identify need and interventions to support those needs.

This approach aligns with the new Special Educational model in schools which focuses on the identification of need and the matching of specific interventions to that need.  Specific interventions are therefore tailored, by the school, to the individual&rsquo;s observed needs by the school, rather than being generic to a specific difficulty or disability. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with the Department's guidance.

The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support</p>  <p>  All Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to cater for children with special educational needs, including pupils with dyslexia.  In September 2017 the Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs in our schools. The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching. This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have been published on Gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/56c43-supporting-pupils-and-students-with-special-educational-needs-guidelines-for-schools/ Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services.  </p>  <p>  Educational Psychologists from the Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work with schools using a problem solving model to help schools identify need and interventions to support those needs.  Under the new model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.</p>  <p>  The Department also provides for special schools and special class placements where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.  Special classes attached to mainstream primary schools also support the needs of pupils with dyslexia.  Such classes have a reduced pupil/teacher ratio of 9:1 and an increased level of capitation grant.  The pupils who attend these classes have, following psychological assessment, been identified as having a specific learning disability.  The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas.  </p>  <p>  The Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to those schools; the enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  </p>  <p>  Funding is available to schools under the assistive technology scheme for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia.

SENOs make recommendations to the Department where assistive technology is required, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Department's Circular 0010/2013.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available at ncse.ie/regional-services-contact-list</p>  <p>  Resources provided to schools also include additional training for teachers who support children with Dyslexia, through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  </p>  <p>  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) is part of the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service, along with the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf/hard of hearing and for children who are blind/visually impaired (VTSVHI). </p>  <p>  The Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers and continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyslexia. The Support Service continues to update current Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses for teachers and design new CPD courses in response to the needs of teachers. </p>  <p>  The Department, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, developed an information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom, DVD and video format. This product was made</p>  <p>  available to all primary and post-primary schools. The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom. </p>  <p>  Further resources provided for pupils with dyslexia include reasonable accommodations in State Examinations such as the provision of a reader, use of a tape recorder or scribe, or a spelling and grammar waiver; further details are available on the State Examinations Commission website at www.examinations.ie/schools/circulars/reasonable-accommodations/.  </p>  <p>  Within the Further Education and Training Sector, a broad range of supports are provided through the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) to support the participation of learners with a disability, including learners with dyslexia.  As well as general adult literacy support, specific supports provided for persons with dyslexia can include:</p>  <p>  - Access to tutors with specific expertise in the area of dyslexia</p>  <p>  - Additional 1:1 tutor support, where necessary </p>  <p>  - Adaptive technologies such as screen reading software</p>  <p>  - Provision of a reader or interpreter service</p>  <p>  - Provision of a reader or scribe or extra time during examinations  </p>  <p>  - Provision of preferred learning-style identification and 'learning to learn' programmes that have particular emphasis on memory and organisational skills.   </p>  <p>  In addition, learners participating in PLC programmes can apply to the HEA &ldquo;Fund for Students with Disabilities&rdquo;. It allocates funding to Further and Higher Education Colleges for the provision of services and supports to full-time students with disabilities. The Fund aims to ensure that students can participate fully in their academic programmes and are not disadvantaged by reason of a disability.  PLC providers have the opportunity to apply to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on an annual basis for funding to provide services to learners with disabilities. It was reported that this funding allowed for provision of one-to-one tutorial support for learners with dyslexia attending PLC programmes.</p>  <p>  The Department also provides funding to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland at national level which helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public as well as assisting in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association. Funding is also provided to enable the Dyslexia Association to provide services and supports to people with dyslexia to access further education and training.   </p>  <p>  Dyslexia Association of Ireland activities in the Further Education and Training Sector include:</p>  <p>  - Development and delivery of expanded CPD training on assessing needs in the FET Sector</p>  <p>  - Piloting &lsquo;brief-assessment&rsquo; model for improved access to dyslexia identification services</p>  <p>  - Providing daily specialist literacy and numeracy tuition to learners on Career Paths courses</p>  <p>  - Facilitating learner progression to education and the workplace through specialist support and training </p>  <p>  - Providing a specialist information service on adult dyslexia, including helpline, drop in service and information seminars</p>  <p>  - Working with the FET Sector, employers and policy makers to drive policy and new initiatives for learners with dyslexia.</p>  <p>  In addition, resources available for adult literacy and numeracy providers include policy Guidelines for Specific Learning Difficulties &lsquo;Keys for Learning&rsquo; www.nala.ie</p>  <p>  The Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), provides financial support through the Fund for Students with a Disability (FSD) to higher education institutions to ensure that they are adequately resourced to cater for the needs of students with disabilities. This Fund provides grants towards the individual needs assessment, provision of services, purchase of equipment and provision of academic supports for students with disabilities.  The scheme applies to students who have serious sensory, physical and/or communicative disabilities, including dyslexia.</p>  <p>  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) offers places at reduced points to school leavers with disabilities. Admissions under the DARE scheme is regulated by the institutions themselves. Each higher institution determines its own admission policy in relation to DARE, the number of places they reserve for DARE and the allocation of those places. </p>  <p>  The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's present or future educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  I hope this information is of assistance to you.</p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland.</p><p>My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,200 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. </p><p>There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement. My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools. The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again later this month, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan is in place for schools and for the Department, similar engagement, on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers, will begin. </p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements were made for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 were maintained and automatically rolled over into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school received an allocation less than that which they had on 30  April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs in mainstream settings continued in post for the current school year in the normal way.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education.</p><p>With regards to the school as outlined in the details supplied, the NCSE have confirmed that on 28/01/2022 it received through its online portal an application from the school, for an SNA Exceptional Review. The application has been acknowledged by the NCSE. The application will be examined and the outcome of the review will issue to the school in due course.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has recently announced additional expenditure measures to a total of &euro;505 million which will make a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.</p>  <p>  As part of these measures, I was delighted to announce an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 that will be paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment. It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March, at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.</p>  <p>  Other significant measures announced by the Government include the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment which is a key measure being developed by the Government to help mitigate the effects of the recent rise in electricity prices.  The scheme, under the auspices of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and supervised by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, will be paid in addition to the gas and electricity element of the Household Benefits Package to qualifying households.  Approximately 2.1m households will benefit by &euro;200 each from the new scheme.</p>  <p>  The combined worth of the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment and the additional fuel lump sum payment is &euro;325 or the equivalent of over 9 weeks' additional Fuel Allowance at current rates.  I have also announced that the Working Family Payment Budget increase announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from the first of June to the first of April.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department also provides Exceptional Needs Payments which may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department also provides a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash, on a weekly, monthly, or less frequent basis.  These payments are considered secondary in nature.</p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase (LAI) is one of those secondary payments.  It is not a scheme or a stand-alone payment in itself, but rather it is a supplement to a social welfare payment of &euro;22 per week made to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  For those aged 66 or over, these payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory), Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension, Widow's/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, there are no circumstances where the Living Alone Increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department.  Any decision to allow those who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment to receive the Living Alone Increase - and thereby establish it as a scheme - would have budgetary and administrative consequences and would have to be considered in the context of Budget negotiations.  </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet from their own resources.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Credits cannot be used to satisfy this condition. 520 full-rate contributions equate to 10 years of full-rate insurable employment.</p>  <p>  The person concerned reached pension age on 1 September 2021.

Since their contributions fall short of the requisite 520 paid full-rate contributions, they do not qualify for State pension (contributory).  They were notified in writing of this decision on 24 August 2021, and afforded the right to request a review and/or appeal this decision. They were also provided with a copy of the social insurance record on which their pension decision was based.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. </p><p>A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2022. </p><p>The programme provides funding towards food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes: The urban school meals scheme and the school meals (local projects) scheme.  The urban school meals scheme, for primary schools, is operated and administered by local authorities and is part-financed by my department.  The school meals (local projects) scheme provides funding towards the provision of food to schools and organisations. </p><p>Funding under the school meals (local projects) scheme can be provided for breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, hot meals and afterschool clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided.</p><p>As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.</p><p>In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  Invitations for expressions of interest were issued to 705 primary schools (612 DEIS and 93 non-DEIS) in November 2020.  A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.</p><p>The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one school for each Local Authority area was selected.  Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area.</p><p>Budget 2022 is providing for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the 81 DEIS schools that submitted an expression of interest but were not selected in the extension to 35,000 children as referred to earlier.</p><p>The estimated cost of providing hot school meals free of charge to all DEIS primary school pupils is &euro;54,810,000. There are no secondary school students in receipt of hot school meals as it is aimed at primary schools with no onsite cooking facilities. </p><p>The estimated cost of providing a cold meal and a hot school meal free of charge every school day to every primary school student, secondary student and every student attending a special school is contained in Table 1 of the below tabular statement.</p><p>The number of children benefitting from the school meals programme and the hot school meals scheme during 2016 to 2021 is contained in Table 2 of the below tabular statement.</p><p>I am committed to continuing to grow the hot school meals element of the school meals programme for DEIS schools and building further on the significant extension announced as part of Budget 2022.  In this regard, I have commissioned an evaluation of the school meals programme to be undertaken in 2022 to inform future policy decisions on the scheme.</p><p>Any extension of the school meals programme or the hot school meals beyond 2022 will need to be considered as part of the budgetary process.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter. </p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; The estimated cost of providing a cold meal and a hot school meal to every primary, secondary and special school student</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>School Type</th>       <th>Cold Lunch</th>       <th>Hot Meal</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Primary </td>       <td>&euro;139.4m </td>       <td>&euro;288.7m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secondary </td>       <td>&euro;87.6m </td>       <td>&euro;181.4m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Schools</td>       <td>&euro;2.1m </td>       <td>&euro;4.4m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Cost</td>       <td>&euro;229.1m </td>       <td>&euro;474.5m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; The number of children benefitting from the school meals local projects programme and the hot school meals programme during 2016 to 2021.</b></p><p><b>Number of Children</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Academic Year </th>       <th>School Meals (Local   Projects)</th>       <th>Hot School Meal </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016-2017 </td>       <td>165,141 </td>       <td>- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017-2018 </td>       <td>201,370 </td>       <td>- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018-2019 </td>       <td>207,594 </td>       <td>- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019-2020 </td>       <td>214,999 </td>       <td>7,012 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020-2021 </td>       <td>218,209 </td>       <td>23,250 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It is estimated that around 400,000 households will benefit from the Fuel Allowance payment in 2022. </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices.  To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced additional expenditure of &euro;505 million to assist householders.  As part of these measures, I have announced an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 payable to fuel allowance recipients.  It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.</p>  <p>  In 2021, 78,378 state pension (contributory) customers received Fuel Allowance and 56,640 state pension (non-contributory) customers received the payment.  The number of recipients of Fuel Allowance in 2021 aged 60 years and older was 214,568.  </p>  <p>  When the change in means threshold for the scheme was introduced, it was estimated that up to 7,800 additional households may qualify for Fuel Allowance.  Officials are continuing to process applications for the Fuel Allowance and therefore the data on the number who have qualified under the expanded criteria is not available.  </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, discretionary payments can be made to help people with the cost of heating their homes.  A Heating Supplement may also be paid to assist people with exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity who cannot meet those costs.  There are over 960 persons currently receiving this supplement.  My Department also provides discretionary Exceptional Needs Payments to people who face difficulties in meeting fuel bills.  In 2021, over 2,300 exceptional needs payments of almost &euro;735,000 were made to assist with electricity, heating and gas costs. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department also provides a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash, on a weekly, monthly, or less frequent basis.  These payments are considered secondary in nature.</p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase (LAI) is one of those secondary payments.  It is not a scheme or a stand-alone payment in itself, but rather it is a supplement to a social welfare payment of &euro;22 per week made to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  For those aged 66 or over, these payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory), Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension, Widow's/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, there are no circumstances where the Living Alone Increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department.  Any decision to allow those who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment to receive the Living Alone Increase - and thereby establish it as a scheme in its own right - would have budgetary and administrative consequences and would have to be considered in the context of overall Budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  As the person in question is not in receipt of a qualifying payment as detailed above, they are not eligible to receive the additional Living Alone Allowance.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet from their own resources.

The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66, who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;273 million this year on HHB. </p>  <p>  In 2022 the estimated cost of the gas and electricity element of the package is &euro;203 million and will benefit over 476,000 households.  The gas and electricity element is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year. </p>  <p>  Any decision to increase the electricity and gas aspect of the package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of overall budget negotiations.  </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced additional expenditure measures to a total of &euro;505 million which will make a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.</p>  <p>  As part of these measures, I was delighted to announce an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 that will be paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment. It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.</p>  <p>  Other significant measures announced by the Government include the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment which is a key measure being developed by the Government to help mitigate the effects of the recent rise in electricity prices.  The scheme, under the auspices of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and supervised by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, will be paid in addition to the gas and electricity element of the HHB package to qualifying households.  Approximately 2.1m households will benefit by &euro;200 each from the new scheme.</p>  <p>  The combined worth of the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment and the additional fuel lump sum payment is &euro;325 or the equivalent of over 9 weeks of additional fuel allowance or 9 months of additional HHB payments.  I have also announced that the Working Family Payment budget increase announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from the first of June to the first of April.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department also provides Exceptional Needs Payments which may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.

Last month, 72% of all Social Welfare payments were made by EFT and 27% were by cash collection at post offices.  A small number of ad hoc payments were also made by cheque, which represented less than one per cent of all payments.</p>  <p>  Customers are offered a choice of payment method for most Social Welfare schemes.</p>  <p>  Before the introduction of temporary public health measures in March 2020, the default payment method for jobseeker payments was cash collection at a post office.</p>  <p>  When health restrictions were introduced in 2020, all jobseekers were given the option of being paid into a bank account.  This was a temporary measure introduced to help reduce the spread of the virus and to ensure that people could comply with social distancing guidelines. </p>  <p>  In line with the general easing of restrictions, I have asked my Department to revert to the normal payment rules for jobseeker payments.  I believe this is the right approach to take in terms of supporting the post office network and in ensuring that, with the removal of restrictions, we return to the pre-pandemic position.</p>  <p>  This change will initially apply to new claims.  Over the coming months, my Department will work to extend the post office requirement to other categories of Jobseeker claims.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that some people who are immuno-compromised may want to avoid crowded settings.  If a person is in this situation, the advice is to contact the nearest Department of Social Protection office.  My officials there will offer help so that these people may still be able to receive their payment online in exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>  The return to pre-pandemic jobseeker payment rules does not affect any other Social Welfare scheme.  People with disabilities will continue to have a choice of payment method, including the option of being paid by EFT.</p>  <p>  Those categories of jobseekers who were paid by EFT prior to March 2020, such as those in part-time work, for example, will also be unaffected by this decision.  It should be noted that one in four jobseeker payments were paid into customers&rsquo; bank accounts by EFT before March 2020.</p>  <p>  As far as possible, the Department remains committed to providing Social Welfare recipients a choice of payment method.  Its consistent position has been that it will respect customer choice as appropriate and make payments in line with customer preference where choice is available.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist qualifying households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant (&euro;1,850) in respect of each person for whom they care.  </p>  <p>  While Carer's Allowance is not a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance, a person in receipt of Carer's Allowance may avail of the fuel allowance payment in certain circumstances.  Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a carer will very often live with and care for a person in receipt of a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  Income from full rate Carer's Allowance is disregarded from the fuel means test, if the carer is providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant, his/her qualified spouse/civil partner or cohabitant or qualified child(ren).</p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, s/he can keep his/her main social protection payment in addition to receiving the half-rate Carer's Allowance.  S/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s/he cares for more than one person.  The payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then s/he is deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then s/he will have to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.

Social Welfare legislation provides that some or all of the cost of One-Parent Family (OFP) payments are recovered from the other parent.

The liability is determined following an assessment of the liable relative&rsquo;s means and circumstances. If they are deemed to be in a position to contribute, that person is contacted by the Department and informed of this.  </p><p>Liable relatives are advised that they can meet their liability by making payments directly to the Department or to the OFP recipient.

This tender process will focus on the provision of own-door accommodation and facilities to allow for independent living such as access to cooking and laundry facilities and communal family areas outside bedrooms. </p>  <p>  This will allow IPAS to improve the quality of the accommodation and services offered to international protection applicants and to move away from reliance on temporary or emergency accommodation. It is anticipated that the tender will provide the Department with adequate capacity so that IPAS can respond flexibly to increases in demand for accommodation as they arise. The tender also seeks to reduce the number of single people sharing rooms with non-family members.</p></reply>

Work has now commenced on implementation of these recommendations. </p>  <p>  The new funding model outlined in Partnership for the Public Good comprises four key elements: two new elements (Core Funding and Tackling Disadvantage funding) and two elements which are developments on the existing funding approaches of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).</p>  <p>  These four elements, and their associated conditions, will form an interlocking and integrated system of funding which is designed to ensure progress on each of the main goals of ELC and SAC policy, and move in the direction of enhanced public management. </p>  <p>  Announcements in Budget 2022 signalled the commitment to the first stage of implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations. </p>  <p>  In particular, a new Core Funding stream for services to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability and the establishment of an Employment Regulation Order, is being introduced in September 2022 and will be worth up to &euro;69 million in 2022, equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year. </p>  <p>  A Transition Fund will be also available to ELC and SAC services from May to August inclusive, during the period between the phasing out of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) in April and the introduction of the new Core Funding stream in September. The Transition Fund will also include the condition that services do not increase the fees charged to parents above September 2021 levels. </p>  <p>  The introduction of fee control measures is one of the recommendations of the Expert Group, and further information on proposed fee management mechanisms in the longer term is available in the Group's report.   </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also announced an extension in the age of children who are eligible for the universal National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidy and a change to how 'wraparound hours' for NCS subsidy are determined. These measures were also recommended by the Expert Group.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the Expert Group are designed to deliver quality for children, affordability for parents, stability for providers, and support employers to improve pay and conditions for staff. The report of the Expert Group is available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/report/.  </p>  <p>  Full implementation of all recommendations will be progressed in the coming years as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process.  An impact monitoring element of this approach to funding is also being developed which will capture data on key indicators that it is anticipated will be addressed through the scheme including workforce pay, qualifications, turnover rates, non-contact time etc.  Progress on the implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations will be reported in the context of the Annual Implementation Report for the First 5 whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families.</p></reply>

On the occasion of the launch there was a direct communication to Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare providers about the report.</p>  <p>  As per the recommendations of the Expert Group, the new funding model comprises four key elements:</p>  <p>  1. Core Funding, a new supply-side payment for providers designed to support quality (including improved staff pay), sustainability, and enhanced public management, with associated conditions in relation to fee control and cost transparency, incorporating funding for administration and to support the employment of graduate staff; </p>  <p>  2. Funding for new universal and targeted measures to address socio-economic disadvantage; </p>  <p>  3. The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, but with funding to support the employment of graduate staff incorporated into Core Funding, and AIM extended beyond the ECCE programme (in line with First 5 commitments); </p>  <p>  4. An amended National Childcare Scheme (NCS) to provide enhanced universal support to all families, tailor additional supports to high volume users of services, and resolve certain issues arising from the NCS work/study test or wraparound policy.</p>  <p>  The announcement of Budget 2022 signalled the introduction of many elements of this model this year. In particular, &euro;69 million for the new Core Funding stream (equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year) is being made available from September.  Developments to the NCS will also come into effect this year including an extension of the universal subsidy to children of all ages up to 15 and a change to the practice of deducting time spent in ECCE or school from the number of hours of NCS subsidy for which families are eligible. </p>  <p>  Core Funding will support providers in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase and is contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee.  Core Funding amounts to an estimated increase of 16% in the total annual income to the sector.</p>  <p>  Initial information about the scheme was made available to providers as part of the Budget FAQ: gov.ie/en/publication/b3e97-budget-2022-overview-and-faqs-for-early-learning-and-care-elc-and-school-age-childcare-sac-providers-and-parents/. </p>  <p>  Further information was issued on 4th of February.  This reiterated that Core Funding will be allocated to services based on their capacity and the qualifications of those working in a service in line with three elements, with the majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;172 million of the &euro;207 million) distributed via the first of these elements:</p>  <p>  1. Main Base Rate: Number of child places in an age group * Value based on ratio that applies to age group * Hours of operation per week * Weeks open per year </p>  <p>  2. Graduate Lead Educator Uplift: Applied at room level, scaling in line with hours per week and weeks per year group is operating (Maximum one Graduate Lead Educator uplift per ELC room)</p>  <p>  3. Graduate Manager Uplift: Applied at service level, scaling in line with hours per week and weeks per year service is operating (Maximum one Graduate Manager uplift per service)</p>  <p>  A Ready Reckoner to support services to determine the potential value of Core Funding will be available in early March along with further communications to the sector about the funding and contract.  </p>  <p>  In the interim period in advance of Core Funding, significant additional investment is being made in the sector through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which will remain available to the sector until April 2022, with a continued exemption to the turnover rule for employers in the sector. Following the cessation of EWSS, a once-off Transition Fund will operate from May to August 2022, to support providers in the period leading up to the new Core Funding stream, in return for a commitment not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. The sum paid to each service under the Transition Fund will depend on the service&rsquo;s capacity and location, and will reflect opening hours. </p></reply>

Income for ELC services comes from a combination of public funding and parental fees.</p>  <p>  Currently, the major funding programmes for ELC services are the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).  ECCE provides for fully funded pre school provision for children during term time for the two years before they begin primary school.

The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has imposed strict guidelines in relation to the scale and "homeliness" of residential care. </p>  <p>  On occasion, the duty to provide accommodation may indeed involve pursuing properties sought by other prospective buyers including families and private individuals. I am acutely aware of the difficulties faced by families and other first time buyers in securing homes in the current property market, but I would hope that those individuals would also place a high value on knowing the State has discharged its duty to provide accommodation to the approximately 500 vulnerable children in care who need it, and indeed consider this a most worthy intervention into available supply.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that Tusla is not involved in large scale purchasing of properties. In recent years the Agency has purchased or attempted to purchase very few properties. </p></reply>

The response to Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) is a cross Departmental and multi-agency issue with overall coordination by the Department of Justice. The Deputy may wish to ask the Minister for Justice for a more comprehensive response on how the State is meeting its commitments under the Convention.</p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is working collaboratively with Government Departments and other agencies to ensure the successful implementation of objectives of the Convention. Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013. </p>  <p>  My Department provided Tusla with an increase in core funding of DSGBV services in 2021 to &euro;28 million and an additional &euro;2 million of contingency funding to help services cope with the ongoing effects of Covid-19. This allows Tusla to fund 60 specialist services around the country, including 44 services providing support to victims of domestic violence, 21 of whom provide safe accommodation in refuges. I have allocated further resources to Tusla under Budget 2022 to maintain supports for DSGBV services and address the recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review of refuge provision. </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that resources will continue to be used to meet obligations under the Istanbul Convention, including:</p>  <p>  - resourcing of the 24 hour national helplines for dv including 24/7 access to translation services;</p>  <p>  - addressing disparities in geographical coverage of services;</p>  <p>  - delivering additional services to targeted groups at risk;</p>  <p>  - provision of therapeutic programmes and access to dedicated supports for all children in refuges;</p>  <p>  - establishing additional regional hubs for men experiencing domestic violence.</p>  <p>  On the provision of refuge spaces, the Istanbul Convention sets out signatory obligations but does not set out a single standard or recommended number of refuge spaces. Article 23 specifically refers to shelters, which should be accessible and &ldquo;in sufficient numbers&rdquo; to provide a place of refuge to victims.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s &lsquo;Review of the Provision of Accommodation for Victims of Domestic Violence&rsquo; has been completed. The Review assesses the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation and has examined the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need, and analysis of proximity to refuge by local communities. The Review identifies priority locations that would give an improved level of cover in terms of distance from safe accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Accommodation Review will assist the whole of Government response in supporting victims of DSGBV and future  expansion of services. The Government will engage with Tusla, Non-Government Organisations, that play a key role in this area and Agencies to progress work in this area. It is important that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible.   </p></reply>

Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars: Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:</p><p>(1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.</p><p>(2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.</p><p>In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.</p><p>(3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.</p><p>As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.</p><p>First 5 commits to increasing investment in early learning and childcare by up to &euro;1 billion by 2028, and includes a range of actions to address availability and affordability, including the development of a new funding model.</p><p>On 7th December, Government approved the recommendations of an Expert Group on a new funding model for ELC and SAC contained in the report Partnership for the Public Good. The new funding model is intended, over time, to deliver transformational change including quality improvements to services, better pay and conditions for staff, tackling disadvantage, improved affordability for parents, better management of supply to meet demand, and support for provider sustainability.</p><p>The Expert Group report informed the transformative package of measures for the sector committed in Budget 2022. This will see Government investment in the sector reaching &euro;716 million next year, an increase of &euro;78 million from &euro;638 million in 2021. The Budget announcements included a Transition Fund between May and August 2022 and a new Core Funding stream from September 2022.</p></reply>

It is an employer-led offering based on a contract of employment between the apprentice and their respective employer. It incorporates a minimum of 50% on-the-job training with off-the-job training which is delivered in a number of different ways according to the apprenticeship programme. This ranges from remote or online learning to one day per week in an education institution or periods of off-the-job training (typically from 10-20 weeks) in an education and training institution at further or higher education level. </p>  <p>  Retrofit activity covers a range of tasks and professions including craft trades and operative level occupations in the construction sector. Among the current 62 apprenticeships available at levels 5-10 of the National Framework of qualifications there are apprenticeships which would deliver skills suitable to retrofit activity include plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering and painting and decorating and the recently launched scaffolding apprenticeship.  </p>  <p>  During their three periods of off-the-job training, craft apprentices are paid training allowances directly by the ETBs, rather than their employers. There are no current plans to further supplement this arrangement. A new payment of &euro;2,000 has been introduced to employers of apprentices on newer, consortia-led apprenticeships, to help level up the supports provided to the two types of apprenticeship programmes. The introduction of this grant means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices will now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the new employer grant.</p></reply>

No. 564 of 2020), which came into effect on 30 November 2020, set out a range of minimum standards to be observed in the provision of property services by licensees to their clients. Failure to comply with the standards set out in the Regulations amounts to improper conduct.</p><p>There is no particular provision in the Land and Conveyancing legislation, in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, or in related regulations, that deals with the situation as described by the Deputy. </p><p>A &ldquo;Contract of Sale&rdquo; for those buying and selling a property specifies exactly what is being sold and the terms and conditions of a sale. A contract, once signed by both parties, binds the parties to the completion of the transaction. Disputes regarding contracts are a matter for the law and the courts.</p><p>It is important to note that in a private treaty sale the licensee is contracted by the vendor and has no contractual relationship with potential buyers or bidders. The licensee is selling the property for the vendor, is acting in the vendor&rsquo;s best interests, and takes instructions from the vendor. Ultimately, it is the vendor's decision on the price they wish to sell the property for and to whom.</p><p>The Deputy's question highlights similar issues to when &ldquo;Gazumping&rdquo; occurs, i.e. where there has been an oral pre-contract agreement between a buyer and a seller, including the payment of an initial &ldquo;booking deposit&rdquo;, for the sale of property at a particular price, and, subsequently, the seller<b></b>refuses to execute the contract due to seeking a higher price from the, or another, prospective buyer. The non-enforceable relationship between the original parties is preserved by use of the term &quot;subject to contract&quot;. </p><p>The problems associated with gazumping were examined in detail by the Law Reform Commission in its 1999 &quot;Report on Gazumping&quot; (LRC 59-1999). The Commission noted that delays arising between the conclusion of negotiations and completion of the formal contract were usually for the benefit of the intending purchaser, for example, to ensure the availability of funding for that property, or to ascertain if there were any legal difficulties in relation to the title. The Commission concluded that the only practicable reforms were to improve the information available to intending purchasers and to regulate the terms according to which booking deposits are paid and accepted. It did not recommend any specific legislative reforms to the legal framework within which gazumping occurs. </p><p>There are no plans at present to introduce or amend legislation in this area. However, as with other policy and legislative reforms, interested parties are welcome to make submissions on this matter.</p><p>The Property Services Regulatory Authority published a detailed &ldquo;Guide for Users of Property Services Providers in Ireland&quot; which explains the legal position in relation to gazumping and related matters such as payment of deposits and signing of contracts. That guide is available on the Authority's website at: www.psr.ie. </p></reply>

It allows those engaged in prostitution to provide information to Garda&iacute;; for instance if they were subjected to violence by clients, without fear of prosecution for selling sexual services. </p>  <p>  Section 27 of the 2017 Act provides for a review of Part 4 of the Act three years after its commencement. The goal of the legislation is to protect vulnerable persons and, in this context, the review will include consideration of whether further measures are needed to strengthen protection for persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.</p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the review explicitly state that persons engaged in prostitution and persons who have been victims of human trafficking will be sought to participate in the review so that their views and experiences can be taken into account.</p>  <p>  The review of Part 4 is being carried out by an independent expert and is ongoing.</p>  <p>  While the review is independent of the Department, the expert has advised that she expects to be in a position to present the outcome of the review by the end of Q1 or the beginning of Q2 of this year.</p>  <p>  I will carefully examine any recommendations of the review once it has been completed and progress appropriate actions to address the issues identified.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are also working on a legislative amendment to expunge previous convictions for &lsquo;sale of sex&rsquo;, or prostitution offences. This is a significant step in recognising and responding to the needs of victims of sex trafficking, and those forced to provide sexual services, which will include people trafficked into Ireland for that purpose.</p>  <p>  Separately, last year the Government approved plans to revise the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) to make it easier for victims of human trafficking to come forward, be identified, and facilitate their access to advice, accommodation and support.</p>  <p>  Currently, when suspected victims of human trafficking are encountered by, or referred to, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are provided with a wide range of services by both the Government and NGOs through the NRM. The new approach acknowledges that other state bodies and NGOs have a role in identifying victims of human trafficking and referring them to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Work is underway to reduce processing times. </p>  <p>  Currently,1,810 travel documents applications are being processed.  Approximately, 900 of these  will be issued under the 1951 Convention.  This year, my Department anticipates that it will receive a further 1,400 applications for this type of travel documents. Travel documents issued under the 1951Convention have a validity period of three years. </p>  <p>  Applications for subsequent travel documents are not considered as renewals, they are considered as fresh applications. If the applicant demonstrates that they require the urgent processing of their application, the application will be prioritised. In these circumstances, the applicant should alert the Travel Document Unit by emailing INISTravdoc@justice.ie, outlining the urgency of the application.   </p></reply>

There is no requirement for Irish or UK citizens to produce passports when travelling within the CTA. However, airline carriers may require their passengers to have a passport in their possession before allowing them to board the aircraft. This is not an immigration requirement.</p>  <p>  There is no segregation of arriving passengers at Dublin Airport. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish CTA passengers in advance of them presenting at immigration control desks. Immigration officers must establish where passengers have arrived from, and to do this, an immigration officer may ask passengers questions to establish their nationality and port of embarkation. Where a person, who is a citizen of the CTA, and who has travelled from within the CTA, is not in possession of a passport, an immigration officer is duty-bound to ask questions to establish that the person is entitled to benefit from the CTA immigration arrangements. The production of other forms of identification can be used to assist an immigration officer with these enquiries.</p>  <p>  Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the CTA and that they have travelled from the United Kingdom, the immigration officer will make no further requirement of that person.  </p>  <p>  Customs checks are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. </p></reply>

During the period 24 January to 13 February prisoners were entitled to receive one physical visit per fortnight with a maximum of two visitors allowed during each physical visit, one of whom may be a child (under 18 years of age).</p>  <p>  From the 14 February 2022 the number of visitors permitted on a visit increased to three people, two of whom may be a child (under 18 years of age).  Prisoners are currently entitled to receive one thirty minute physical visit every fortnight and on the weeks that they are not receiving a physical family visit, prisoners are able to avail of a video visit. Prisoners may also choose to avail of a video visit instead of a physical visit if they prefer.</p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy, that no decision has been taken in relation to the resumption of weekly visits but this matter is under constant review.  The Irish Prison Service continues to try to balance the need for infection control with the need to ensure that prisoners continue to receive support from family and friends while in prison. </p>  <p>  The high prevalence of Covid-19 in our communities continues to present a high risk of transmission to the prison population and this risk is higher with the increased movement of people into and out of our prisons.

The Bill has three key purposes:</p>  <p>  - To provide a legal basis for the deployment and use of body-worn cameras by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  - To provide for the extension of the circumstances in which CCTV may be authorised, taking account of GDPR and the Law Enforcement Directive.</p>  <p>  - To provide an updated legal basis for the deployment of Automatic Number Plate Recognition technology by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  My Department engaged extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Garda oversight bodies and strategic partners during the preparation of the General Scheme, as well as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.</p>  <p>  Following government approval, the General Scheme was sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting, and drafting is continuing. The General Scheme was also submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report was received in December 2021 and is currently being examined by officials in my Department.</p>  <p>  This legislation is a significant priority and I and my Department are working intensively with the Attorney General to ensure that the Bill can be published by the end of March. I hope that it will then complete its passage through the Oireachtas as soon as possible, hopefully later this year. </p>  <p>  I should point out that while this will not be an excessively long Bill, I am aware that the issues it addresses, such as privacy rights and data protection, are complex.  All uses of recording devices under the legislation are linked to Garda functions, namely the investigation, detection, prevention and prosecution of criminal offences, public order and public safety, and safeguarding the security of the State.</p>  <p>  While Garda&iacute; have extensive common law powers at their disposal when carrying out their functions, it is important to have in place a modern and robust statutory framework to set standards and procedures in relation to the use of recording devices and to provide appropriate oversight of the use of the powers, in particular where they could infringe on the privacy or data protection rights of citizens.   </p>  <p>  The digital recording technology for policing purposes continues to evolve at pace and it is vital that the law supports the Garda&iacute; to respond dynamically to this and be in a position to make the best use of emerging technology.  Nevertheless it is also my intention to build in a number of safeguards to the legislation in order to maintain public trust in policing and to make clear that any intrusions into a citizen's private life are only where necessary and proportionate and for justifiable policing purposes. </p></reply>

However, at all times and during all levels of restrictions, my Department has continued to accept and process citizenship applications.  </p>  <p>  Some cases are unfortunately taking more than 24 months to process. My Department's objective is to achieve a significantly improved decision making timeframe of 6-9 months for a majority of applications during this year. My Department has introduced a number of changes to help speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to support applicants and increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. </p>  <p>  A particularly useful change that has been welcomed by applicants is that since the beginning of this year, all applicants are no longer required to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour certified copy. A points-based scoring system for proofs of residence has also been introduced to assist applicants and ensure that submitted applications are complete. </p>  <p>  My Department has identified that approximately 20% of the 25,000 applications currently in the system are incomplete, with further action required by the applicant to progress the application. From the end of March, if there is no further engagement with my Department, these applications will be deemed ineligible and returned to the applicant. This will allow my officials to focus resources on processing complete applications and ensure that decisions are delivered more quickly for those applicants. </p>  <p>  The aim of the steps taken is to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  As an early indication of the success of these measures, my Department made more than 11,500 citizenship decisions last year, which is the highest level since 2015.</p>  <p>  Last December, an additional 8 staff members were allocated to the citizenship team, bringing the total staffing complement to 75 staff / 68 Full Time Equivalents. There are also 5 Temporary Clerical Officers currently assigned to the team. </p></reply>

As this is a child protection and welfare issue primarily, the Department of Children has lead responsibility in leading policy development in this area.   </p>  <p>  There are differences between the legal and constitutional position in this jurisdiction and the UK, and we will continue to examine if elements of the Operation Encompass approach can be adapted.  </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that, in October 2020, having received correspondence from the Children's Ombudsman, Department officials consulted with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the practicality of a child protection initiative along the lines of Operation Encompass, which was operating in England and Wales.</p>  <p>  Operation Encompass involves the police service making immediate notification, within 24 hours, directly to teachers/principals after they have been called to a domestic violence incident in which children were a factor. The practice in the UK which involves police and teacher collaboration, differs from how cases are dealt with in this jurisdiction where there is contact with social services, or Tusla.</p>  <p>  One key factor to bear in mind is that Children First does not operate in the UK and it would appear that there is limited interaction between police and social services except where a crime is disclosed. In contrast, in this jurisdiction, Garda policy provides that Tusla are to be notified of every domestic abuse-related incident affecting or involving children, which is not the case in other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

Convention against Torture is advanced and my Department is leading on the preparation for a General Scheme of Places of Detention Bill which is expected to be published shortly, subject to Government approval. It will then be referred for drafting in the normal course. </p>  <p>  The important work of the Prisons Visiting Committees is recognised and the Programme for Government commits to reviewing the existing function, powers, appointment procedures and reporting processes for these Committees. A Review Team was established in September 2020 to take this commitment forward and their work is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Work to introduce a new Prisoner Complaints System is also ongoing and I can advise the Deputy that substantial work has been completed on the necessary actions to introduce this new system. This includes staff training, the development of an integrated IT system to support case handling and a draft policy for complaints handling. Engagement with the OPC with a view to completing work on the required Statutory Instrument is ongoing as is engagement with relevant stakeholders, including the Office of the Ombudsman in preparation for its future operation.  </p>  <p>  I want to emphasis that throughout the pandemic, everyone involved in the Prison Service have worked tirelessly to ensure effective infection control measures are in place while at the same time continuing to provide a range of rehabilitative support services for prisoners in custody. Covid related restrictions and changes in regime, however necessary, unavoidably impacted the lives of those in custody.  Restrictive measures have been modified in line with the various announcements made by Government and in line with advice from Public Health/HSE and the Irish Prison Service National Infection Control Team.  </p>  <p>  I am informed that the Prison Service intends to continue to review remaining restrictions on an ongoing basis and the unwinding of these measures will be determined by the level of risk posed to prisons at that time and taking account of Government decisions.  </p></reply>

This mix of accommodation enables the Service to provide a varied prison regime where progression through the system assists prisoners to prepare for release from custody on completion of a custodial sentence. </p>  <p>  The provision of single cell accommodation for all prisoners, while desirable, is not currently possible due to the existing capacity within the prison estate, and current levels of committals. The Deputy many be aware that there are approximately 3,300 usable cells in the estate with about 3,800 people in custody at any one time. </p>  <p>  It is also the case that the number of people in custody is subject to increasing and decreasing trends and prior to the onset of the pandemic there were over 4,200 prisoners in custody. </p>  <p>  Data from the last published cell occupancy census carried out by the Prison Service indicates that 56% of prisoners in custody are accommodated in single cell accommodation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that some prisoners are accommodated in multi-occupancy cells for reasons other than capacity and some prisoners, at committal stage, indicate a preference to share a cell with another person who may be known to them.  </p>  <p>  All prisoners are assessed by prison management on committal with regard to their suitability for sharing a cell. </p>  <p>  The need to ensure the availability of modern prison facilities with adequate capacity will be central to the development of the new Irish Prison Service Capital Strategy 2023, against the background of the work underway as part of the Programme for Government to develop policies and proposals to review policy options for prison and penal reform, including the effective and appropriate use of non-custodial sanctions. </p></reply>

Following a competitive tender process in May, research commenced on this important work in June. The aims of the research include to:</p>  <p>  - Identify the various definitions and characteristics of parental alienation being used internationally.</p>  <p>  - Investigate what is known about the prevalence of this issue (in Ireland or internationally) through examination of the literature.</p>  <p>  - Identify and outline the various approaches and responses being taken in other jurisdictions to deal with the issue of parental alienation (legislative and otherwise).</p>  <p>  - Describe, outline and evaluate any studies which have examined the effectiveness of these various international approaches and assess the relevance of these studies to the Irish context.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that a draft report was received by my Department at the end of November and is now being reviewed. It is also my intention to commence a public consultation on the topic in the coming weeks. Both the research and consultation will, I expect, create a deeper understanding of the issue, and inform my Department&rsquo;s consideration of policy and law in this area. The best interests of the child will of course be paramount in any considerations.  </p>  <p>  I recognise that going through the breakdown of a relationship can be a difficult and traumatic time for children and parents and that reform of the current family justice system is needed to better support families through such times.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes in specialised centres.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. This has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. Work is ongoing on the drafting of the Bill, with a view to its publication as soon as possible this year.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of finalising a Family Justice Strategy, which will set out a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. </p>  <p>  To develop the new strategy, a Family Justice Oversight Group was established by my Department. To assist its work, this Group has engaged in a phased consultation process where relevant stakeholders, the public, children and young people who engage with the family justice system gave their views on how a modernised family justice system should look. </p>  <p>  One of the areas being considered by the Group is additional training for those working within the family justice system that would benefit all those who engage with the system. It is intended that the Family Court Bill will provide that specialist knowledge and ongoing professional training in the area of family law would be required to be appointed as a Family Court judge. A number of other issues are being considered for inclusion in the emergent Family Justice Strategy, including the availability of and access to support services; the potential use of less adversarial approaches to the resolution of disputes, where possible and appropriate; information dissemination and awareness raising; and oversight of the implementation of any proposed reforms. An action to publish the new family justice strategy will be included in my Justice Plan 2022. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, and the conduct of any court case is a matter for the presiding judge.  For that reason, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any specific family law case that has come before the courts. </p></reply>

In addition, the issue of outdated alcohol licensing legislation was a key challenge identified by stakeholders in the published report of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce.</p>  <p>  I am delivering on that commitment by preparing Heads of a General Scheme of a Sale of Alcohol Bill.</p>  <p>  The objective of the proposed Bill is to repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018, the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008, and the  Public Dance Hall Act 1935, and to replace them with updated and streamlined provisions more suited to the 21st century. </p>  <p>  Codifying alcohol licensing law into a single Act will make it more accessible and user-friendly for the licensed trade, courts, Garda&iacute; and the public. </p>  <p>  The development of this Bill will take account of concerns including on a wide range of issues including public health, public order and the interests of consumers, communities and businesses.  </p>  <p>  Last November, I launched a wide ranging consultation to seek the views of the public on the modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing laws. The consultation, which ran until 21 January this year, looked at how best to update the existing laws governing the sale and regulation of alcohol in Ireland. Members of the public, academics, sectoral groups, and representative organisations were invited to complete an online survey and/or make a written submission to my Department. There was a high level of response to the consultation, with in excess of 5,000 responses received, and I would like to thank all of those who engaged with this process. My Department is now reviewing these responses.</p>  <p>  I also plan to host a webinar in early March to give an opportunity for further discussion of the issues of concern to stakeholders including the question of whether the requirement to extinguish an existing licence when seeking a new one should be continued under the forthcoming Bill.   </p>  <p>  I intend to progress this legislation in the months ahead with a view to enacting it this year. Details of the proposed reform will be included in the General Scheme when published. I look forward to working with members of this House to bring about this important reform.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  Last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, the highest level achieved since 2015.  Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Where a person has a constitutional entitlement to citizenship, such entitlement subsists even where the person renounces their citizenship &mdash; in other words even though the person has renounced their citizenship they remain constitutionally entitled to it. In practice, such a person can exercise that subsisting entitlement by simply declaring his or her citizenship in the prescribed manner.</p><p>In all other cases, the position is set out under Section 21 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, which covered all Irish citizens at the time of its enactment. This Section provided that an Irish citizen of full age, who was a citizen of another country and for that reason desired to renounce their Irish citizenship, could do so by lodging a declaration of alienage. A condition was that the person concerned was ordinarily resident outside the State. To re-acquire citizenship, they would have to apply for naturalisation.</p><p>With one exception, this remains the position in relation to all former Irish citizens who do not have a constitutional entitlement to Irish citizenship. This includes people who acquired Irish citizenship by descent alone, by post-nuptial declaration and through the naturalisation process. </p><p>It also includes people born in the island of Ireland on or after 24 June 2004, who, at the time of their birth, do not have at least one parent who is or is entitled to be an Irish citizen. The one exception arises in this type of case. If born between 24 June 2004 and 1 January 2005 (the date of implementation of the relevant provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004), they continue to be dealt with for the purposes of re-acquisition after renunciation as if they are constitutionally entitled to citizenship. This exception is simply a reflection of the passage of time between the enactment of the constitutional amendment and the implementation of the primary legislation and the prospective approach taken in matters of this nature.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that both I and my senior officials are in regular and frequent communication with the Garda Commissioner and his senior management team. These engagements take various forms and cover the full range of issues of relevance to our roles.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Operation Thor was launched in November 2015 and is focused on burglary and burglary-related crime, particularly over the winter months, when instances of burglary increase. I am informed that Operation Thor proactively targets organised crime gangs and repeat offenders through coordinated crime prevention and enforcement activity based on intelligence and the latest crime trends and patterns to protect communities.</p>  <p>  This annual focus from Operation Thor has proved highly successful in tackling property related crime since its inception in November 2015, with incidents of residential burglary significantly reduced nationally since its introduction. In 2015, there were in excess of 18,800 residential burglaries reported. By contrast, to the end of 2021 there were just over 6,000 residential burglaries reported, a reduction of over 66% or approximately 13,000 less residential burglaries.</p>  <p>  While the COVID-19 pandemic was clearly a factor in some of this reduction, with people more likely to be present in their homes throughout the day, there has been a marked and consistent downward trend in such offences since the introduction of this Garda focus through Operation Thor.</p>  <p>  One of the five main focuses of Operation Thor is Crime Prevention and Protecting Communities, including visible focused patrols at specific times of day, targeting burglary &lsquo;hot-spots&rsquo;, intelligence gathering on known offenders, high-visibility check points to prevent ease of movement, strong crime prevention communications and reassurance with communities.</p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation in excess of &euro;2 billion for 2022, including funding for the recruitment of up to 800 additional Garda trainees and up to 400 Garda staff. This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also allocated &euro;12m for investment in the Garda fleet, which means more high visibility policing in our towns and cities and on our roads. This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a key element of the work of the Roads Policing Unit is denying criminals the use of the roads network. In addition to focusing on the lifesaver offences of speeding, seatbelts, mobile phones and driving under the influence, there is a significant focus on crime prevention and crime detection. Roads Policing work closely with crime units to target known criminals and to disrupt their activities through strict enforcement of road traffic legislation.</p></reply>

This is a very positive start and I encourage anyone who may be eligible to apply.</p><p>The criteria for the scheme have been designed in line with the Programme for Government commitment, which is to bring forward a regularisation scheme to create new pathways for long-term undocumented people and their dependents. The period of four years undocumented residence, or three years in the case of applicants with children, is consistent with this commitment and has been approved by Government. This is a once-off, time bound scheme that is expected to benefit thousands of undocumented people living in Ireland. There are no plans to introduce any other scheme or to extend the criteria. </p><p>The international protection strand of the scheme opened for applications on 7 February 2022 and<b></b>applications will be accepted for six months until 7 August 2022.

They should, however, contact my Department at: citizenshipinfo@justice.ie, if they intend to remain outside of the State for an extended period of time.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  My Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments.

In line with the Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centre) Regulations 2006, each inpatient mental health service, as in general health services, must have a complaints procedure in place, such as the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;Your Service, Your Say&rsquo; service. I further note that 'Your Service, Your Say' is available to anyone accessing HSE mental health services, be that on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Following the investigation of the complaint by the HSE, an individual may request an internal review to be carried out by the HSE if they are not happy with the outcome. Furthermore, in cases where the complainant is not satisfied with the response to their complaint, they can request an external review from the Office of the Ombudsman, or in the case of child and adolescent services, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. This option is available to anyone who accesses our public health services, be it mental health services or otherwise.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act, published in July 2021, provides for every person accessing treatment in an inpatient mental health facility to be given information about their care and treatment, including an explicit requirement to provide information on the service&rsquo;s complaints procedure. Furthermore, the powers of the Inspector of Mental Health Services are being expanded to include 24-hour community residential facilities and community mental health services. As under the existing Act, the Inspector will continue to meet with any person accessing mental health services who has requested such a meeting.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme also includes a statutory right to engage an advocate under numerous heads, including a definition of advocate under Section 2, information on advocacy to be provided to people in approved inpatient facilities under Section 16, 79 and 91, access to an advocate during a review board under Section 16B, during inquiries carried out by the Inspector under Section 55, or when making decisions about treatment under Sections 56 and 104. </p>  <p>  There are a number of advocacy supports for people accessing mental health services offered by the public and voluntary sectors. The HSE currently provides some advocacy supports such as a Peer Advocacy Service in mental health. This service is concentrated on inpatient services and is delivered by an external agency on behalf of the HSE. In addition to adult advocacy services, HSE National Mental Health Services has a pilot scheme in place in two inpatient units to provide an advocacy service through an external provider for young people and their families using Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).</p>  <p>  The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS) provides a free, confidential service to people with mental health difficulties, particularly people with complex needs. NAS is funded and supported by the Citizens Information Board, which has a mandate under the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Comhairle Act 2000 to provide advocacy for persons with disabilities. Citizens Information Centres can be found nationwide and provide free, impartial advice and advocacy, or the Citizens Information Phone Service can be reached by phone.  </p>  <p>  Sage Advocacy also provides some advocacy support to people with mental health difficulties, particularly older people, in their role in supporting and enabling vulnerable adults and older people to make their voices heard in their healthcare decisions. The Irish Advocacy Network provides peer advocacy supports to people with mental health difficulties which can be accessed on a self-referral basis.</p></reply>

The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19. This covers private nursing homes (whether private, voluntary, Section 39 etc.).</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining our health service but did not work in such exposed areas. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which frontline healthcare workers faced.</p></reply>

We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.</p>  <p>  We have made a specific commitment to supporting "the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland". A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls.</p>  <p>  The endometriosis workstream identified a number of potential actions in this area, including enhanced services and supports and increased information and awareness. There has been significant work underway to reflect these actions in implementation, including direct investment in services which I will mention in further detail shortly, and a public webinar on endometriosis which was held on November 24th 2021. </p>  <p>  Information provided by the HSE indicates that endometriosis is a difficult condition to diagnose and treat because of the variation of presentations, impacting the physical and mental wellbeing of patients at varying levels. Treatment may include pain medications, hormone treatment and surgical interventions. The time to diagnose endometriosis varies by patient due to its varying and ambiguous symptom presentation. The HSE's National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the treatment of endometriosis, I am advised that a GP referral to a gynaecologist is the standard pathway of care for the management of endometriosis in Ireland. This is similar to the pathway in place for the management of other gynaecological conditions.</p>  <p>  The  HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme  has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  As such, the Programme has developed an Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care which centres on the establishment of one-stop &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; ambulatory gynaecology clinics. An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources than the traditional outpatient model and it is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  Building on progress made in rolling out these ambulatory gynaecology clinics in 2020 and 2021, funding has been provided under Budget 2022 which will facilitate the establishment of additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics, thereby completing the implementation of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care. This will bring the total number of these clinics to 20 nationally.</p>  <p>  As part of the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, in April 2021, I announced the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH) to deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there is no ready access in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Further to the above, funding provided under Budget 2022 will enable the expansion of the endometriosis service at TUH as well as the establishment of a new service for more complex endometriosis cases at Cork University Maternity Hospital</p>  <p>  The issue of endometriosis has also been highlighted through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. This was a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.  278 women participated in open interviews and workshops. A report on the findings of the &lsquo;Radical listening&rsquo; exercise on September 14th can be found here:</p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/ebe3e-significant-milestone-as-minister-donnelly-publishes-a-report-of-womens-voices-on-womens-health-following-a-radical-listening-exercise-this-year/  </p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will bring to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The taskforce will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p></reply>

A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the recipients and the donors of blood and blood products.</p>  <p>  Following a review of existing donor deferral policy by an independent expert group last year, the IBTS announced a range of changes to their existing deferral policies, including those concerning Men who have Sex with Men (MSM).</p>  <p>  The objective of these policy changes is to move towards an individual assessment process for donors, making blood donation more inclusive. As a prerequisite to this, the existing paper-based Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire (HLQ) will be replaced with an electronic Self-Assessment Health History (SAHH) questionnaire.</p>  <p>  The IBTS have advised that they expect the first phase of these deferral policy changes to begin on March 28th of this year. This initial phase will reduce the existing 12-month deferral period for MSM to 4 months. The replacement of the HLQ with the SAHH is expected to take place in July/August of this year, with the individual assessment system to follow later in the year once the SAHH is established.</p></reply>

I have also asked the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, the Department of Health group established in 2019 to improve women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare, to review the report currently being prepared by HSE on this issue with a view to achieving the best possible outcome for women suffering with this condition.</p><p>The commitment to Women&rsquo;s Health has been reflected within Budget 2022, in the allocation of &euro;31 million for new development funding to specifically support women&rsquo;s health.</p><p>Budget 2022 will:</p><p>- Invest almost &euro;9 million additional funding to ensure continued implementation of the National Maternity Strategy into 2022 and beyond, building on the significant investment in 2021 </p><p>- Continue improvements in our gynaecology services by establishing a further 6 ambulatory gynaecology &quot;see and treat&quot; clinics, bringing the total to 20 clinics nationally </p><p>- Investment to fund access to contraception for women aged 17-25  </p><p>- Support further developments in menopause care by increasing the number of specialist menopause clinics from 1 clinic to 4 clinics nationally</p><p>- Increase investment in sexual assault treatment units  </p><p>- Invest in tackling period poverty for the first time  </p><p>- Funding for the establishment of a new Obstetric Event Support Team</p><p>- Funding to establish a perinatal genetics service</p><p>- Build on initiatives started in 2021, by further expanding specialist endometriosis services for more complex cases across two centres</p><p>- Invest an additional &euro;5 million into the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund to fund innovative new approaches to women&rsquo;s health services nationwide. </p><p>In addition, a further &euro;16m in other measures to support women's health has been embedded within other new measures for 2022 within the Health Vote in areas such as cancer, mental health and social inclusion budgets, bringing the overall investment in women's health to &euro;47m in additional funding provided for 2022.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  Finally I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter however you will understand that the Department of Health cannot comment on individual cases.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining our health service but did not work in such exposed areas. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which frontline healthcare workers faced.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Sectoral Bargaining Fund process is to deal with outstanding adjudications, commitments, recommendations, awards and claims within the terms of the Fund and within the Exchequer funding limit in place. </p>  <p>  Health Management remains committed to implementing the 2020 Pharmacist Agreement, as agreed through the WRC process.  However, when Building Momentum came into effect in 2021, all outstanding agreements became subject to Sectoral Bargaining.  Failure to work through the mechanisms of Building Momentum would undermine the PSA and would be unfair to other unions who have adhered to the terms of the agreement.</p>  <p>  Building Momentum, to which F&oacute;rsa are signatory, outlines that all parties are committed to participation in the dispute resolution procedures set out in the agreement. All parties encompassed by Building Momentum have also agreed that, notwithstanding their continuing right to access the Labour Court/Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme, this shall only be utilised after the dispute resolution processes outlined in the Agreement, have been fully exhausted.</p>  <p>  The delivery of industrial peace is an essential requirement of this Agreement. Accordingly, all forms of industrial action are precluded.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE remain open to engagement with F&oacute;rsa but are compelled to resolve any disputes in compliance with the provisions allowed for under Building Momentum.  </p></reply>

Face masks/coverings are also recommended for children in third class and above in primary school and guidance has issued to schools from the Department of Education on this. This guidance can be found online: www.gov.ie/en/publication/d3c55-department-of-education-guidance-on-the-use-of-face-coverings-in-primary-schools/ </p>  <p>  The Government decision is based on a recommendation from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) following its meeting on 25 November. As the Deputy will be aware, this issue has been subject to ongoing review by the NPHET and was considered again at this meeting in light of the sharp rise in the incidence in the 9 to 11 year old age-group in November.</p>  <p>  As part of its deliberations, the NPHET considered previous advice from HIQA on the issue, the detailed epidemiological situation in children, international guidance, international practice, the evidence in relation to the use of face coverings in children, and the potential benefits and harms from any recommendations. The NPHET recognised the very significant impacts previous social and economic restrictions have had on families and children to date and also reiterated that a core priority of the NPHET throughout the pandemic has been to protect the continued operation of the education and childcare sector, recognising its importance to the health and development of children. Given the very high incidence in children at that time, the NPHET advised that measures should be taken to interrupt chains of transmission to protect those core priorities including the recommendation in relation to mask wearing, to support families and young children in staying safe over the coming period with a view to reducing risk of disease transmission.</p>  <p>  Both the NPHET and Government were clear that this measure was being introduced as a temporary, interim measure and would be reviewed in mid-February 2022.</p>  <p>  More recently, the NPHET met on 20 January and provided advice to the government stating that while it was safe for the majority of public health measures to be lifted, the requirements for mask wearing in all settings where currently regulated for under Statutory Instrument and protective measures in schools, early learning and care facilities should be retained until 28 February. This advice was accepted by the Government. </p>  <p>  The NPHET will meet again on 17 February and will provide further advice to the Government in relation to remaining public health measures. This will include advice in relation to mask wearing for children aged 9 to 12.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will bring to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan. </p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual Waiting List plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy concerning the number of persons waiting for a surgical procedure across each specialty is outlined in the attached document.

In order to ensure competitive pricing as part of their outsourcing programme, the NTPF works with private hospitals from a panel agreement and engages in procurement processes through e-tender.</p><p>In relation to insourcing, a public hospital may have some spare capacity but require further funding in order to utilise it.  Such public hospitals may make a proposal to the NTPF, whereby the NTPF pay a fixed price per procedure performed. The amount paid by the NTPF meets the extra costs incurred by the public hospital in performing the procedures.</p><p>In relation to the information requested by the Deputy, the attached table provides data in respect of the number of IPDC and GI treatments arranged in 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="2">2021 Treatments Arranged IPDC</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Specialty</td>       <td>Treatments Arranged</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cardiology</td>       <td><div>1,183</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cardio-Thoracic Surgery</td>       <td><div>57</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clinical Immunology</td>       <td><div>100</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gastro-Enterology</td>       <td><div>118</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gastro-Intestinal Surgery</td>       <td><div>40</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General Medicine</td>       <td><div>34</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General Surgery</td>       <td><div>3,644</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gynaecology</td>       <td><div>751</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Neurosurgery</td>       <td><div>356</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ophthalmology</td>       <td><div>6,000</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Orthopaedics</td>       <td><div>2,880</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Otolaryngology (ENT)</td>       <td><div>1,501</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Respiratory Medicine</td>       <td><div>147</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pain Relief</td>       <td><div>835</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Plastic Surgery</td>       <td><div>445</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Urology</td>       <td><div>4,139</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vascular Surgery</td>       <td><div>713</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td><div>22,943</div></td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="2">2021 Treatments Arranged GI</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Specialty</td>       <td>Treatments Arranged</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gastro-Enterology</td>       <td><div>5,589</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gastro-Intestinal Surgery</td>       <td><div>375</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General Medicine</td>       <td><div>2,197</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General Surgery</td>       <td><div>8,745</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paed Gastro-Enterol</td>       <td><div>414</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td><div>17,320</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

There are an estimated 6-8,000 known rare diseases affecting up to 6% of the total EU population, (at least 30 million Europeans), and perhaps up to 300,000 Irish people during their lives.</p>  <p>  It can be a challenge to provide highly specialised treatment or care for patients who have complex conditions. This is especially true when the prevalence of such conditions is low, as is the case for rare diseases. This challenge is due to both the scarcity of expertise and to the scattering of small patient populations across the EU, sometimes in isolated locations where expertise does not exist or cannot be accessed.</p>  <p>  European Reference Networks (ERNs) are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe. They aim to facilitate discussion on complex and rare diseases that require highly specialised treatment and concentrated knowledge and resources. European Reference Networks (ERN) create a clear governance structure for knowledge sharing and care coordination across the EU to improve access to diagnosis and treatment, as well as the provision of high-quality healthcare for patients. They are networks of centres of expertise and healthcare providers that are organised across borders.</p>  <p>  On Friday 26th November 2021, Ireland received formal notification from the European Commission (DG-Sante) that the 15 applications (involving a number of Centres of Expertise led from five academic hospitals) submitted to join the European Reference Networks were approved.  </p>  <p>  This is a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service with international approval/endorsement, to facilitate mobility of expertise, virtually or physically and develop and share information, knowledge and best practice and foster developments of the diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment of rare diseases.  Very importantly, this is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases for the enhanced cross border provision of highly specialised/rare disease services. </p>  <p>  These 5 academic hubs will be pivotal to and drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care in collaboration with the established momentum of the ERN model which incorporates the most talented clinicians and investigators in the European Community.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person</p>  <p>  - Bed and board</p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living</p>  <p>  - Laundry service</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people.

I also note growing awareness and interest in this topic, which derives in part from the current focus on genetic mutations in the SARS-Cov-2 virus, and genetic sequence-based surveillance which is informing public health measures globally. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the Health Research Board, our lead agency with responsibility for supporting clinical, population health and health services research, is active in this agenda. Their new strategy for the years 2021-2025 contains an action to &ldquo;engage with the Department of Health, the HSE and others to explore opportunities and interfaces for current and future investments in genomic research and personalised medicine&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, the HRB convened stakeholders (including Science Foundation Ireland, researchers, clinicians, patient organisations, and the HSE) to discuss current opportunities and challenges for Ireland in genomics medicine, research and innovation. The HRB is coordinating an application from Ireland to join a Digital Europe funding programme call to support member states to develop the necessary data infrastructure (and skills and standards) to collect, store, manage, share and analyse genomic datasets within and across EU member states, in a secure, transparent and trusted manner. The consortium will secure European funding to allow authorised data users, such as clinicians and researchers, to advance our understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments and precision medicine, and for improved public health measures that will benefit citizens, healthcare systems and the overall economy.</p>  <p>  This is an important step to ensure that investment in Ireland in genomic medicine and research is appropriately governed, acceptable to citizens, and will enable global research efforts towards improving healthcare. </p>  <p>  The HRB will establish a national mirror group to follow these developments in the EU (including the One Million Genomes Project and the Beyond 1 Million Genomes project) and will strive to connect researchers (clinicians and funders) in areas that will benefit from being able to share and analyse genomics data, in particular rare diseases and cancer, where the HRB is also actively supporting research at national and EU-level. </p>  <p>  Genomics and personalised medicine will be important issues to consider in the context of the new National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, led by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. I am committed to working with other Government departments and agencies to this important agenda to capitalise on our collective national investments and plans in genetics and genomics research, to sustain efforts in capacity-building, and to plan for adequate research infrastructure to support these developments. By working together towards a coherent framework and common principles, we can foster a vibrant portfolio of research in genetics and genomics, amenable to academic and industry partnerships, and which will support and drive advances in healthcare for our citizens. </p></reply>

The dental care is provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. Patients may choose to have their treatment undertaken by any dentist who participates in the Scheme.</p><p>The Scheme covers a dental examination, two fillings in each calendar year, prescriptions, denture repairs and extractions as necessary.

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI.  It is important to note that the measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining our health service but did not work in such exposed areas. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which frontline healthcare workers faced.</p></reply>

The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin.</p>  <p>  I have referred the question of active partnerships between the HSE and private providers, and the number of other projects at pre-planning, planning or construction across the country that involve elective hospitals, to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of January 2022 there were 4,901 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,437 in January 2019.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which I will bring to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy concerning cataract surgeries carried out under the NTPF, is outlined in the attached document. The NTPF has advised that annual financial statements have not be finalised for 2021 and that an accurate figure for 2022 is not yet available.</p><p>Cataracts Treated through NTPF Funding 2018-2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>No. of Cataracts Treated</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td><div>6,707</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td><div>7,253</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td><div>5,042</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021*</td>       <td><div>5,922</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Please be aware the annual financial statements have not be finalised for 2021</p></reply>
