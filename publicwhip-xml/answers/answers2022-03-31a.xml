Community residences are to enable people who have experienced mental health difficulties to live more independently. </p>  <p>  In November 2020, Glenwood House in Carrigaline, County Cork, was purchased for &euro;750,000. Since purchase, approximately &euro;500,000 has been spent to bring it up to standard. </p>  <p>  It is planned to be staffed 24 hours per day by registered psychiatric nurses. Residents will be supported and trained to live independently so individuals will progress to living independently in the community. The property represents an opportunity for service users of Mental Health Services in Cork to experience high quality accommodation in a community residential setting. </p>  <p>  A Planning Permission application is under consideration by the planning authority in relation to the premises and a decision on this application is expected soon. Subject to the Permission being approved, the service will proceed with the identification of the particular service users who may take up residence in the unit, based on their assessed needs and their will and preference. These service users will be included in planning the final refurbishment/redecoration of the unit. </p>  <p>  Rehabilitation and Recovery are central tenets to Sharing the Vision. Promoting access and inclusion is important in improving a person&rsquo;s health as well as social functioning. However, people with enduring mental illness still have difficulty accessing the support they need to avail of housing and employment opportunities. Rehabilitation and recovery services have a key role in helping people with enduring mental illness to gain access to housing, employment and social/leisure activities and are a key priority for Minister Butler when considering new developments in service provision.</p></reply>

It must also be ensured that they do not cause any unintentional consequences for existing public order laws.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, while it was originally intended to provide for safe access to termination of pregnancy services in the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, a number of complex legal and policy issues were identified during the drafting process which necessitated further deliberation and advice. These issues were further debated during the second and committee stage for the Safe Access to Termination of Pregnancy Services Bill 2021, and I wish to commend the Together for Safety group for its work on this legislative proposal which is further informing necessary considerations in this important area of work.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are actively engaging with key stakeholders to work through these challenges, refine the policy position, and explore legislative options. At my request, and with the support of the Joint Committee on Health, officials met the Health Committee last week to collaboratively discuss options for overcoming the challenges that have been identified by the Department. I understand that this was a positive session, with the Committee voicing their support for bringing forward safe access legislation. I wish to thank the Committee for their time and input to support the advancement of robust legislation for safe access zones. It is important to me that the appropriate legislative solution is progressed with cross party support. My officials have listened carefully to the views and inputs of the Committee and will consider these into their ongoing work on this matter.</p>  <p>  My Department is now settling the policy position, which is complex, and I have sought input from the Attorney General to support this process. In parallel, officials are continuing to work with an inter-departmental working group to advance these proposals and develop a robust General Scheme of a Bill.</p>  <p>  Subject to Government approval, I plan to have proposals for safe access on the legislative programme for 2022.</p></reply>

That is almost double the number of patients seen in 2021 (44,522).</p>  <p>  I am aware that there is currently no Podiatrist working in West Cork, despite a national campaign to fill the post.  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare is redirecting a Podiatrist from another area to see patients.  Those who are most urgent on the waiting list are being seen first.  There are 297 people on the waiting list in west Cork.  The longest waiting time is 49 weeks, and the reassigned Podiatrist has started to address this.  When all high-risk patients are seen and space in the schedule becomes available, moderate risk patients will be offered scheduled appointments.  Podiatry services are offered in Kinsale and Carrigaline.</p>  <p>  A new Primary Care Centre will open in Bandon in the coming months.  St. Mary&rsquo;s Primary Care Centre, Gurranabraher, are providing services to Community Healthcare Network 11.</p>  <p>  Regretfully there are several podiatry vacancies across Cork and Kerry.  There are 14.6 podiatry vacancies of the 24.5 allocated whole-time equivalent podiatry posts.  These are all new development posts, assigned within the last 18 months.  There is a national recruitment campaign underway to fill these posts.  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare intend to run a local recruitment campaign to attract eligible candidates.  It is anticipated that these campaigns should fill any posts remaining unfilled.</p></reply>

HSE Estates has advised that the centre is scheduled to become operational during Quarter 3 this year.</p>  <p>  The opening of the Station Road centre will be a significant development in the delivery of community-based health services for the people of Ennis and the surrounding area.  Once fully operational, it will provide a full range of GP, nursing, therapy and dental services.  I also understand that the centre will offer specialist nurse led clinics for the treatment of leg ulcers, as well as access to community diagnostics.  </p>  <p>  The staff based in Station Road will form part of the new Community Healthcare Network for the area which will help us to develop more integrated care based on the needs of the local population.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the centre will support the Enhanced Community Care programme in Clare by serving as the base for a Chronic Disease Management team which will provide a county-wide service to individuals with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD and asthma.  An Integrated Care Programme for Older People team will also be based in the centre.  This team will support older people over 75 years of age and those living with frailty to live well at home. </p>  <p>  A total of around 77 staff will be based in the centre and directly involved in the provision of Primary Care Services to local residents. </p>  <p>  The investment in Station Road is a clear example of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering more comprehensive and accessible primary care services to people across the country in line with the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></reply>

The HSE advises that over 45,300 scans have been completed to date in 2022. The HSE also has in place a procurement framework specifically for diagnostics.</p><p>Funding of &euro;5 million was allocated under the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan to secure an additional 30,000 acute diagnostics appointments. Up to March 25<sup>th</sup>the NTPF funded 9,157 such diagnostics procedures. This is ahead of target, so at yesterdays meeting of the Waiting List Task Force I asked them to examine if more ambitious targets could be set for this year.</p><p>Under a pilot project the HSE currently collect data in respect of CT MRI and Ultrasound. The information that is collected is being tested and validated at hospital, hospital group and national level. The Deputy should be aware that the number currently reported (226,966 in Q4 2021) includes routine and planned/surveillance patients and is not reflective of the actual number of patients waiting.  Work is ongoing to disaggregate this data, so that an accurate reflection of patients actually waiting for an initial diagnostic text can be reported.</p><p>As part of the longer-term reform actions, a programme of work is due to commence, to deliver full waiting list data collection for all radiology diagnostics.</p></reply>

The critical services are expected to be completed by end of June 2022. </p><p>Further reconfiguration works to the existing ED will also be completed as part of the project. It is expected that these new facilities would be available for patients and staff during August.</p><p>While improving service delivery capability, the interim ED and associated works will also serve as enabling works for this larger project; freeing up the site required for a proposed new block.</p><p>I am aware that this project has been discussed for the last 10 years and I spoke with the team there about this on my visit. I share their frustrations.</p><p>However, one of the reasons that the project is still in development phase is that there has been a very significant increase in the scale and ambition for the solution on the Galway site.</p><p>Originally the proposal was for a new multistorey ED block, but now the proposals, driven by local requirements and the need to effectively build on a constricted site, means that we will shortly be receiving proposals costed in the hundreds of millions.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, all projects proposed in excess of &euro;100m must be subject to the full scrutiny of the Public Spending Code process.</p><p>The HSE are currently drafting a Strategic Assessment Report to ensure full compliance with PSC requirements. I expect this to be submitted to my Department by early May. </p><p>If granted approval-in principle, the preliminary business case can then be updated by the HSE and be brought forward for review to progress proposals. </p></reply>

This is to recognise their unique efforts and increased risk in performing their duties during the pandemic. Importantly and distinctly from other workers, those eligible are, in general, frontline healthcare workers who worked or trained in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments/clinical settings.</p>  <p>  My officials are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure, including eligibility criteria that apply. </p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions on this matter. This consultation is part of our objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly. After conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. </p>  <p>  Noting that this consultation has not yet concluded, it would be inappropriate to comment further on it at this point.</p></reply>

The report recommended the establishment of multi-agency Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT), with round the clock response capabilities, throughout the country. </p><p>These teams have become a globally recognised model within contemporary policing for safely and effectively assisting people who experience a mental health crises or related problems within the community. The CIT model promotes strong community partnerships among policing bodies, health professionals and appropriate follow-on support agencies. </p><p>A steering group was nominated in Limerick by the Chief Superintendent AGS and the Chief Officer of the HSE. Steering group membership included the following &ndash; Superintendent AGS; Sergeant AGS; Executive Officer AGS; Head of Service, Mental Health, HSE; Executive Clinical Director HSE; Consultant Psychiatrist; Area Director of Nursing, HSE and Assistant Director of Nursing, HSE. The steering group met 12 times over the past 12 months. </p><p>The Limerick Steering Group were tasked with considering the potential of this type of intervention in the Irish context with the two key agencies being HSE Mental Health Services (Mid West) and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Limerick Division. The work of the group has involved a review of the presentations to both agencies and an examination of the cross over in presentation. The group also engaged with people with experience of engagement with AGS at times of mental health crisis to understand how a new approach might better this experience. The AGS members of the group had significant engagement with Policing Departments in other jurisdictions to understand how this type of approach worked in those geographies &ndash; this included the US and Northern Ireland. </p><p>The progress of the steering group was delayed by the significant pressures on frontline services associated with several COVID surges. However, the steering group met last Friday (March 25th) and the final proposal for a pilot project was to be submitted to the project sponsors last Monday (28th March). The steering group await the outcome of the proposal.</p></reply>

By establishing the sequence of an individual&rsquo;s genetic material, it is possible to identify sequences or mutations which are specific to that person. Not only can these sequences identify the cause or stage of a disease, or the risk of future disease, they can also help predict the likely benefits or side effects of a particular medication. Genomics has the potential to reshape clinical practice and to fundamentally change the way we prevent, diagnose, treat and monitor illness, providing the opportunity to have more precise and tailored treatments for patients.</p>  <p>  Ireland is well placed to utilise genomic data. Currently, there are a number of relevant genomic initiatives being developed in both the clinical and research arenas, and by public and private enterprise.</p>  <p>  For example last year I authorised &euro;2m in expenditure to establish a National COVID Biobank as part of our overall response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Biobanks are a crucial platform for the deployment of genomic medicine and our intention is to use this initiative to build a national approach to biobanking beyond the immediate need to respond to COVID. </p>  <p>  These initiatives need to be co-ordinated within a broader strategic approach to the use of genomic medicine in Ireland. My Department will oversee the development of policy for genomic medicine within an ethical and legal framework which maximises potential health benefits while minimising potential harms.</p></reply>

The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. The new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Department of Health and Health Service Executive, has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code. Following the approval of the new Strategy, Project Preliminary Business Cases for the three locations are being finalised for consideration and review by my Department. The Preliminary Business Cases provide a framework to assess costs, benefits, affordability, deliverability, risks and sensitivities associated with potential project options as well as providing the information required to inform decisions on the viability and desirability of public spending proposals.</p>  <p>  These Project Business Cases will make a recommendation on and seek approval-in-principle to proceed on the optimal strategy for the delivery of the additional national elective capacity in Cork, Galway and Dublin. These business cases are at an advanced stage of development.</p>  <p>  When approved internally, the Business Cases will be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s recently introduced PSC External Assurance Process and Major Projects Evaluation Group, after which further memoranda for Government could then be brought forward. While it is difficult to be certain about timelines, following these assurance steps I am hopeful we could proceed to approval-in-principle (Gate 1 of the Public Spending Code) before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  In advance of receiving approval-in-principle from Government in line with the PSC, it would be premature to commit to any specific timeline, other than to say that the Department is proceeding with the expedient development of PSC compliant business cases in order to deliver additional elective ambulatory capacity in line with the Government decision of December 2021 provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin.</p></reply>

Despite these challenges, the HSE has advised that CUH continues to maintain all services, highlighting that the isolation of Covid positive patients and contacts has been maintained.</p>  <p>  The HSE has further advised that, in order to maintain rosters, the hospital has used agency staff, where available, as well as seeking overtime from available CUH staff. I am cognisant of the efforts and flexibility the staff have displayed and I'm advised that the Management at CUH continue to relay their appreciation to staff. In addition, the HSE has advised that the recruitment campaign at CUH is ongoing, targeting recruitment across all disciplines in the hospital. </p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that forensic monitoring of patient and staff infection outbreaks will remain a high priority for CUH.

The HSE is continuing to utilise capacity in private hospitals and is reviewing elective care to reduce pressure on bed capacity. Patients are requested to use alternatives such as their local pharmacist, GP or minor injury unit as appropriate.  </p><p>Investment of &euro;1.1bn was provided in budget 2021 to expand capacity, increases services and support reform and this level of investment is being maintained in budget 2022. A further &euro;77 million has been invested in the 2021/22 Winter Plan. To date over 800 additional beds have been provided in acute hospitals since the start of 2020.</p><p>To provide leadership, governance and oversight of the implementation of the Winter Plan at local level and national level,  the Chief Operations Officer has established the Integrated National Operations Hub (INOH) with defined membership from all relevant service and enabling functions with a clear Terms of Reference. For the purposes of coordinating the response to COVID-19, each geographical area has an Area Crisis Management Team (ACMT). Many of the Winter Plan measures will continue for the rest of the year.</p><p>The current situation in hospital Emergency Departments is under constant review by my Department through ongoing engagement with the HSE.</p><p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Department of Health and HSE has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code, setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects.</p>  <p>  The provision of additional protected capacity for elective care is further confirmed by the Government Decision, in December 2021 and subject to the necessary approvals and requirements under the Public Spending Code being met, on a new National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy. This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.  No other locations are under active consideration. It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including Limerick and neighbouring mid-west counties.</p>  <p>  The elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases commencing with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients and then by in-patient treatment. On this basis, the Elective Care Centres (ECCs) will be designed to provide sufficient capacity to facilitate future phases, including some elective in patient capacity, thereby providing a sustainable and strategic response to cater for the highly dynamic landscape of healthcare policy and practice. </p></reply>

I met patients, staff and the management team. My discussion with the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Management Team of the hospital included unscheduled care activity, recruitment and staffing and waiting lists. We also discussed current pressures and possible solutions including pathways through ED, discharge options, the impact of recent investment including beds and the new ED, and additional capacity requirements.</p><p>I also met with staff of the hospital and listened to their experiences of dealing with Covid over the past two years and their ideas for improving services to patients. This included a group of Clinical Nurse Managers and a group of Non Consultant Hospital Doctors. </p><p>I also met with staff from the Community Health Organisation including the Head of Service, Primary Care, the Head of Disability Services and the Head of Older Persons Services. </p><p>I had the opportunity to see the new infrastructure provided recently including the Haematology/Oncology Ward, the new Emergency Department and the new Bed Block. I also saw the new theatre block in Croom. </p><p>The current congestion in Emergency Departments is due to constrained bed capacity caused by combination of the high number of patients in hospital with COVID-19 (1624 nationally on Monday 28th March, of which 105 were in UHL), the increased number of delayed transfers of care cases which is partly due to COVID outbreaks in nursing homes and the very high number of people attending EDs in recent weeks. </p><p>While attendance and admission numbers are now exceeding pre-pandemic levels, the continued requirement to provide separate Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 pathways presents an additional challenge to patient flow in all hospitals and Emergency Departments.</p><p>The HSE is actively working with hospitals and hospital groups to mitigate the situation. The HSE is continuing to utilise capacity in private hospitals and is reviewing elective care to reduce pressure on bed capacity.

A further &euro;77 million has been invested in the 2021/22 Winter Plan. To date over 800 additional beds have been provided in acute hospitals since the start of 2020.</p><p>It is accepted that a key part of the solution for Limerick is additional beds. The new 60-bed modular ward block at University Hospital Limerick is a significant step in addressing this, and provides modern, single-room inpatient accommodation with improved infection prevention and control capabilities as well as patient flow throughout the hospital.</p><p>This follows the completion of two separate rapid-build projects delivered under the Government National Action Plan in Response to Covid-19, which provided an additional 38 inpatient beds on site at UHL.</p><p>Furthermore, Project Ireland 2040 includes provision for a 96-bed replacement ward block at UHL. The project has now been tendered in line with public procurement requirements, with tenders returned on 3rd February. The tender evaluation process is currently underway. It is hoped to progress this process in the coming weeks with a view to then seeking HSE Board approval for the award of the works contract.</p><p>The Department and the HSE will continue to work with local hospital management to further improve patient experience in UHL.</p></reply>

I recognise that the DTSS, which dates from the 1990s, needs to be reviewed and aligned with best international evidence and practice, and legislation, as outlined in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy. Regretfully, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the roll-out of the Policy to be delayed and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred. Work on a substantive review of the DTSS Contract will commence by the end of Q2, 2022.</p><p>  I have also acknowledged immediate issues of concern with the Scheme, which I am addressing as a matter of priority. Officials from my Department and from the HSE have held three rounds of discussions with the Irish Dental Association, the most recent on 2nd March when my Department and the HSE presented proposals to invest additional resources in the Dental Treatment Services Scheme.</p><p>I have now given approval for significant fee increases to be paid to contracted dentists across a number of items, including the Dental Examination and Fillings. I have also approved the reintroduction of Scale and Polish for medical card patients on the DTSS. These new measures are designed to address access problems for patients, and address dentist&rsquo;s concerns about the viability of the DTSS, while aligning the DTSS more closely with the Dental Treatment Benefits Scheme, which is widely operated by private dentists for PRSI patients.</p><p>These measures should amount to an additional investment this year of about &euro;26 million over what was spent on the Scheme in 2021. My Department and the HSE will work together to quickly implement the changes to the Scheme for the benefit of patients.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p>  <p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p>  <p>  Waiting list reductions and maximum waiting time targets apply to all acute hospital scheduled care active waiting lists. The HSE is engaged with hospital groups in a process to focus on specialties and procedures towards which the waiting list fund needs to be specifically directed to ensure the targets are achieved by year end.</p></reply>

Sharing the Vision aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030.</p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision Implementation Plan 2022 &ndash; 2024 was collaboratively developed by the HSE and the Department of Health, overseen by the National Implementation and Monitoring Committee (NIMC). The NIMC is tasked with the implementation monitoring of the policy. The Plan sets out individual programme pathways of implementation for each of the 100 policy recommendations for the next three years.</p>  <p>  The Implementation Plan will build on existing initiatives already underway, for example in the provision of digital mental health services, the continued phased development and rollout of the national clinical programmes, which are at the heart of service improvement, and the ongoing legislative reform through the review of the Mental Health Act. </p>  <p>  A whole-of-government National Implementation Monitoring Committee (NIMC) was established in December 2020 to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the policy and to monitor progress. The NIMC is made up of the NIMC Steering Committee, supported by a NIMC Reference Group of Service Users and Family Members, which has been established, and NIMC Specialist Groups, which have been established in priority areas of development including Youth Mental Health Transitions, Acute Bed Capacity development and also in Women&rsquo;s Mental Health.</p>  <p>  Additionally, there is work ongoing across the HSE and public sector more broadly that aligns to the recommendations of Sharing the Vision, including the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan, (2021-2023) and the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan (2022-2023).</p>  <p>  The Government, along with NIMC, the HSE and its partners, remains fully committed to the reform of our mental health system as promised by Sharing the Vision. </p>  <p>  A total of &euro;1.149 billion has been allocated to mental health in Budget 2022. Specifically, this Budget is supporting the continued implementation of new developments under Sharing the Vision, including out of hours supports, CAMHS services, crisis resolution team, the national clinical programmes, and specialist mental health services for older people. </p></reply>

An independent led prescribing audit for each of the CAMHS teams, which I sought as an additional action beyond the recommendations set out in the Maskey report, will include a review of prescribing for all diagnoses and medications - details of this are currently being finalised. In addition to these two audits, the HSE will expedite the development of clinical standards for prescribing practice in children with and without psychosis. Once these standards have been developed and implemented, an annual audit will be carried out to measure compliance against these standards (in line with recommendations in the Maskey Report).</p>  <p>  Separately, the HSE is commissioning qualitative research to identify the experiences of children, young people and their families using CAMHS nationwide. </p>  <p>  HSE supports are available for children, young people and families affected by the report, with a dedicated helpline available to those who need it.

In 2019, the PSC was updated and introduced a new project lifecycle, tightening the arrangements for project decision-making, and clarifying the roles of the parties involved including the responsibilities for Sponsoring Agencies and Approving Authorities. The PSC also provides detail on the requirements at each stage of the new project lifecycle.</p>  <p>  A business case for relocation of NMH has been submitted to the Department by the NMH Project Board. The Business Case is subject to technical review by the Department of Health, including through the External Assurance Process recently introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Pending favourable review under the Spending Code, a Memorandum for Government will then be brought forward to progress the programme for the NMH.</p>  <p>  If approval in principle is granted, the project can move to preparation of tender documents in line with EU law and deployment of a tendering strategy.</p></reply>

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.  The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established.  </p></reply>

A further &euro;77 million has been invested in the 2021/22 Winter Plan. To date over 800 additional beds have been provided in acute hospitals since the start of 2020.</p>  <p>  To provide leadership, governance and oversight of the implementation of the Winter Plan at local level and national level, the Chief Operations Officer has established the Integrated National Operations Hub (INOH) with defined membership from all relevant service and enabling functions with a clear Terms of Reference. For the purposes of coordinating the response to COVID-19, each geographical area has an Area Crisis Management Team (ACMT).  Many of the Winter Plan measures will continue for the rest of the year.</p>  <p>  The current situation in hospital Emergency Departments is under constant review by my Department through ongoing engagement with the HSE.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on 25 February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce active waiting lists for acute scheduled care by 18% this year, which will bring the number of people waiting to their lowest point in five years.  </p>  <p>  Under this Plan, the Department, HSE and NTPF intends to deliver urgent additional capacity to treat 1.7 million people as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. </p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan will also progress work towards the achievement of intermediate waiting time targets this year, as set out in the National Service Plan (of 18 months for OPD; 12 months for IPDC; and 12 months for GI scopes).</p>  <p>  As a response to the recent surge in both ED attendance and COVID-19 cases the CEO of the HSE has written to the CEOs of all hospital groups advising them of the need to prioritise unscheduled COVID-19 care and urgent time sensitive work for 14-day period. The resulting curtailment of elective care (and associated staff shortages) will negatively impact achieving waiting list reduction targets.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The Waiting List Task Force continues to regularly monitor the impact of COVID-19 on waiting list reduction targets. Additional capacity is bring sought through the Private Hospitals to minimise the impact of the current surge on core activity.</p>  <p>  With the onset of the 4th wave of Covid-19 at the end of December 2021 and January 2022 the HSE with the support of the Department negotiated a new amended Agreement with the Private Hospitals to run to the end of June 2022.  The new Agreement sought to draw on the lessons from the operation of Safety Nets 2 and 3.  </p>  <p>  The most significant change from the previous Safety Net Agreements was the adoption of a dual approach to obtaining access to the private hospital capacity.  As with the outgoing agreement it would allow access of up to 15% or 30% of the private hospitals&rsquo; capacity depending on which metrics were met.  At each level, the HSE would have the option to seek access on either a reasonable endeavours basis i.e. voluntarily, or by issuing a guaranteed capacity demand, which would require the private hospitals to provide the capacity. Under the agreement payments for capacity unused by the public system i.e. retainer payments will not be payable where the agreement is invoked on a reasonable endeavours basis but will be payable where a guaranteed capacity notice is issued. </p>  <p>  In addition, in August 2021 the HSE established a procurement framework to allow public hospitals to access services in private hospitals.  The procurement framework that was put in place sought tenders from private hospitals, based on competitive pricing, for approximately 700 types of medical and surgical procedures for adult and paediatric inpatient, day care and critical care beds.  A separate procurement framework was put in place for diagnostic services.  The Framework is in place for a period of 4 years. </p></reply>

This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two satellite centres, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. The capital budget has not yet been depleted and to date, &euro;963.75m of the &euro;1.433bn budget has been drawn down for works on the project across the three sites.</p>  <p>  There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes, and the Employment Order.</p>  <p>  Additional costs in relation to the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites brings the total programme cost to &euro;1.73bn. This includes investment in ICT, a new Electronic Health Record system and the Children's Hospital Integration Programme (the merging of three paediatric hospitals) including commissioning.</p>  <p>  Brexit, the pandemic and recent geopolitical developments have severely impacted supply chains and NCH project is not immune to these external challenges. Every effort is being taken to mitigate the risks but these externalities beyond the control of the contractor and the NPHDB make speculation and more definitive forecasting unwise.</p>  <p>  Definitive updates on costs cannot be provided due to the fact that we are talking about a live contract and speculation on any costs will be detrimental to the Development Board&rsquo;s commercial engagements.</p>  <p>  The contractor has submitted a number of substantiated claims, which it is entitled to do. Equally the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is entitled to defend claims that it and its advisors consider to be inappropriate. The NPHDB will enforce the contract and defend those claims, where appropriate.</p>  <p>  There are three matters relating to the New Children&rsquo;s hospital before the High Court.  The decisions to issue these proceedings rests with the NPHDB and the contractor.  As the matters are now before the Courts, I do not wish to say anything that could in any way prejudice those proceedings.</p></reply>

In 2019, the PSC was updated and introduced a new project lifecycle, tightening the arrangements for project decision-making, and clarifying the roles of the parties involved including the responsibilities for Sponsoring Agencies and Approving Authorities. </p>  <p>  These are defined processes in which all Departments and agencies are subject to and must follow to ensure that Government, as the approving authority for all major projects, can be satisfied that the project is the best means to achieve a policy goal and that we achieve maximum value for money for the taxpayer. </p>  <p>  The specific requirements that must be included in a business case at the various stages of the PSC are detailed at www.gov.ie/en/publication/public-spending-code/ </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE, as a Sponsoring Agency, to ensure that new capital investment proposals are initiated in line with this new lifecycle approach and through all subsequent stages. For projects that pre-date the updated PSC, the Department, the HSE and project boards are working, with input from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as appropriate, to ensure that these projects can be incorporated into this lifecycle approach.</p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department of Health have a significant number of projects underway and in development. The vast majority of these are projects with an investment of less than &euro;100m and under the PSC the Department is the approving authority. In these instances officials are working with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to implement proportionate measures for the application of PSC requirements.</p></reply>

Given the number of citizen assemblies that are committed to in the Programme for Government, and the constraints that had delayed their establishment, these citizen assemblies will run concurrently, for the first time. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the inaugural meeting of the citizen assembly will take place in April this year, with the assemblies concluding their work and submitting their reports ideally by the end of the year at latest, and earlier if possible. </p>  <p>   It is proposed that a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use will directly follow these two assemblies, with the intention of running it concurrently with the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the Future of Education, if learnings from the concurrent running of citizen assemblies suggest that this operational model is the best way forward.</p>  <p>   In line with this decision, I have commenced preparations for the citizen assembly on drug use. This is being done to ensure that there will be no delay in establishing the citizen assembly when the two other citizen assemblies complete their work, before the end of this year or in first quarter of 2023 at the latest. This will allow a period of over one year for the Government to consider its recommendations.</p>  <p>  Drug use affects all members of society, whether directly or indirectly, and imposes very significant social and financial costs. There are two issues in particular I wish the citizens assembly to consider, namely, how can we better meet the diverse health needs of people who use drugs, and also, how can we prevent the harmful impact of drugs on children, families, and communities.</p>  <p>  I would also like to see an international component to the citizens assembly, so that there is an exchange of good practice from the British Ireland Council work sector on drugs (which I chair) and the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan, especially on alternative approaches to coercive sanctions.</p>  <p>  The recent meeting of the National Oversight Committee for a citizens' assembly on a national drugs strategy afforded me an opportunity to consult with committee members to hear their views and perspectives regarding the content of the citizens&rsquo; assembly.</p>  <p>   As we prepare for the citizen assembly on drug use, work will continue in implementing the government&rsquo;s health-led national drugs strategy and the six strategic priorities for the remaining four years of the strategy.</p>  <p>  I am very positive about the potential contribution of the citizen assembly to the Government's health-led response to drug use as it will provide an opportunity to reflect on progress made under the national drugs strategy.</p></reply>

The professions of counsellor and psychotherapist were designated for regulation by my predecessor in accordance with the Act and will be regulated by CORU.  </p><p>  The Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board was appointed in February 2019 and held its inaugural meeting in May 2019. The work of the Registration Board is significantly more challenging than for registration boards for some of the more established professions, owing to the different and complex entry paths into these professions, the variety of titles used, and the variety and number of courses and course providers.</p><p>  The Board is now undertaking the substantial work required to open the registers for counsellors and psychotherapists. This work includes the scoping of professions and titles and the consideration of the minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners and for future graduates. This work is ongoing.</p><p>  Owing to the significant body of preparatory work that the Registration Board is required to undertake; it is not possible to say with any degree of accuracy when the professions will be fully regulated. Once the register is opened, there will be a 2-year transitional period to allow existing practitioners to register. </p><p>  I hope that this information is of assistance to you.</p></reply>

The Plan will reduce active waiting lists for elective care by more than 132,000 (18 percent) this year, which will bring the number of people waiting to their lowest point in five years. The Plan also details a number of actions to reform waiting lists, such as revising and modernising care pathways and greatly enhancing data and information, with the aim of bringing real and meaningful changes to our waiting lists and waiting times for elective care in the years to come. </p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan will also progress intermediate waiting time targets this year, as set out in the National Service Plan (of 18 months for OPD; 12 months for IPDC; and 12 months for GI scopes).</p>  <p>  The 2022 Plan also focuses on 15 high volume inpatient day case procedures, including cataracts and hip and knee replacements, so that every person waiting over 6 months for one of these procedures, and who is clinically ready, will receive an offer of treatment.</p>  <p>  While the Plan is largely on track, with fewer than expected additions to the waiting lists so far this year, the recent surge in both ED attendance and COVID cases (and associated staff shortages) in hospitals in March is resulting in the curtailment of elective activity. The current situation in hospital Emergency Departments and the effect on elective care is under constant review by my Department through ongoing engagement with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  As a response to the recent surge in both ED attendance and COVID-19 cases the CEO of the HSE has written to the CEOs of all hospital groups advising them of the need to prioritise unscheduled COVID-19 care and urgent time sensitive work for 14-day period. The resulting curtailment of elective care (and associated staff shortages) will negatively impact achieving waiting list reduction targets. </p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The Waiting List Task Force continues to regularly monitor the impact of COVID-19 on waiting list reduction targets. Additional capacity is being sough through the Private Hospitals to minimise the impact of the current surge on core activity.</p>  <p>  With the onset of the 4th wave of Covid-19 at the end of December 2021 and January 2022 the HSE with the support of the Department negotiated a new amended Agreement with the Private Hospitals to run to the end of June 2022.  The new Agreement sought to draw on the lessons from the operation of Safety Nets 2 and 3. </p>  <p>  The most significant change from the previous Safety Net Agreements was the adoption of a dual approach to obtaining access to the private hospital capacity.  As with the outgoing agreement it would allow access of up to 15% or 30% of the private hospitals&rsquo; capacity depending on which metrics were met.  At each level, the HSE would have the option to seek access on either a reasonable endeavours basis i.e. voluntarily, or by issuing a guaranteed capacity demand, which would require the private hospitals to provide the capacity. Under the agreement payments for capacity unused by the public system i.e. retainer payments will not be payable where the agreement is invoked on a reasonable endeavours basis but will be payable where a guaranteed capacity notice is issued.</p>  <p>  In August 2021 the HSE established a procurement framework to allow public hospitals to access services in private hospitals.  The procurement framework that was put in place sought tenders from private hospitals, based on competitive pricing, for approximately 700 types of medical and surgical procedures for adult and paediatric inpatient, day care and critical care beds.  A separate procurement framework was put in place for diagnostic services.  The Framework is in place for a period of 4 years.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that all necessary action is currently being undertaken in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure that organ donation and transplant services continue in so far as practically possible. However, due to the risk Covid-19 presents to transplant patients, and the negative impact increased pressure on ICU capacity has on transplant services, it is possible that reduced levels of organ donation and transplant service activity will be experienced while infection rates of Covid-19 remain high.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland (ODTI) and the transplant centres have and continue to work to ensure that the most time critical and life-saving transplants proceeded based on careful risk-benefit assessment.</p>  <p>  With regard to critical care capacity baseline critical care capacity is now 301 beds, up from a figure of 297 at the end 2021. We had 255 critical care beds at the beginning of 2020. The 301 reflects an 18% increase since the start of the pandemic. Funding provided to date will allow for capacity to reach 340 by 2023.</p></reply>

Projections for 2022 show that over 1.5 million patients will be added to active waiting lists this year. Many people stayed away from the health service during the pandemic and, as these people come forward for treatment, it will place huge additional demand on health services.</p>  <p>  Under the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, the Department, HSE and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity to treat 1.7 million people as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  If this &euro;350 million was not made available it is projected that, due to surging demand from the anticipated release of post-pandemic pent-up demand for healthcare and demographic factors, active waiting lists for acute scheduled care would significantly increase by up to 40 percent at the end of 2022, with over a million people remaining on these lists.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan will also progress intermediate waiting time targets this year, as set out in the National Service Plan (of 18 months for OPD; 12 months for IPDC; and 12 months for GI scopes).</p>  <p>  The 2022 Plan also focuses on 15 high volume inpatient day case procedures, including cataracts and hip and knee replacements, so that every person waiting over 6 months for one of these procedures, and who is clinically ready, will receive an offer of treatment.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Plan details 45 actions to reduce and reform waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Plan targets are largely on track, with fewer than expected additions to the waiting lists so far this year. However, the recent surge in both ED attendance and COVID cases (and associated staff shortages) in hospitals in March is resulting in the curtailment of elective activity, which will negatively impact achieving the waiting list reduction targets.</p></reply>

The Taskforce was convened in September 2019, to improve health outcomes and health experiences for women and girls.</p><p>The issue of menopause has also been emphasised through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. This was a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.</p><p>278 women participated in open interviews and workshops, where menopause was a recurring theme. Through this process, the taboo around discussing menopause, and a lack of trusted information, were consistently raised as key issues for women experiencing menopause. I published a report on the findings of the &lsquo;Radical listening&rsquo; exercise last September. </p><p>Significant activity is currently underway to enhance the supports available to perimenopausal women. Last September I announced my commitment to establish dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland. These clinics will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause.</p><p>While the majority of women who seek support for their menopause can be effectively supported within primary care by their GP, approximately 25% of symptomatic women will require specialist medical expertise in menopause. Specifically, this cohort of women will fall within four broad categories:  </p><p>- Treatment does not improve their menopausal symptoms;</p><p>- They have on-going troublesome side effects e.g. bleeding;  </p><p>- They have contra-indications to HRT; and </p><p>- There is uncertainty about the most suitable treatment option for their menopausal symptoms e.g. complex medical history.</p><p>The intention is that these more complex cases can be dealt with in a number of specialist menopause clinics being developed around the country.</p><p>Last December I announced the opening of the first specialist menopause clinic in the National Maternity Hospital. The clinic is multidisciplinary, supported by GPs with a certified special interest in the area of menopause and by clinical nurse/midwife specialists. In addition to seeing women who meet the clinical criteria for referral to the service, the clinical team also provides advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care.  </p><p>Building on this development, Budget 2022 provided further commitment to a focused approach in menopause care with funding for three further specialist menopause clinics, to bring the number of clinics nationally to four. Once in place, specialist menopause clinics will be provided in Dublin, Limerick, Galway and Cork working to complement the menopause support available to women in their community.</p><p>Additional activity underway and planned in the area of menopause includes:</p><p>- GP training is a key aspect of women receiving the best care through menopause. The Irish College of GPs are active members of the Women's Health Taskforce and continue to be engaged on how women's health can be better considered within the primary care setting. Relevant activity includes the collaboration between ICGP and the British Menopause Society to develop training in menopause management, which is currently in place; an ICGP Women&rsquo;s Health Webinar on menopause and endometriosis which was held in June 2021 and had 1567 attendees; and a GP Education course which was established in September 2021 in the area of Community Gynaecology which includes menopause as a topic. Funding has been provided through the Women's Health Fund to develop a 'quick reference guide' for GPs on the menopause, to support primary care provision in this area.</p><p>I have also outlined my support for a new ICGP post of Clinical Lead for Women&rsquo;s Health in General Practice, the first such post in Ireland. This will enable the development of a comprehensive life-course approach to women&rsquo;s health in General Practice.</p><p>- A number of health topics relating to women's health, including menopause, have recently been updated and are now live on the HSE A-Z webpage. This information is an important first step towards delivering enhanced information and education on menopause. A public information webinar on the menopause was held on November 29th, 2021. </p><p>- A civil service webinar on 'Menopause at work' was held on October 18<sup>th</sup>2021, and further HR training to better understand the challenges and solutions for supporting women in their menopause journey within the civil service was held on November 30<sup>th</sup>2021.</p><p>- The Healthy Workplace Framework is due to be published in the coming months. Following publication, an Implementation Group will be established with responsibility for developing an action plan. A representative from Women&rsquo;s Health will be included on the Implementation Group to ensure the needs of women in the workplace are incorporated. This has particular reference to increased awareness of menopause within the workplace.</p><p>In addition to the activity outlined above, menopause will continue to be a priority for my department and this Government for 2022 through targeted funding for menopause projects via the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund and implementation of the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022-2023.  </p></reply>

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. </p>  <p>  This scheme is a once off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 inclusive. This includes pigs sent to slaughter, exported or sold commercially from a breeding herd. </p>  <p>  The scheme was notified to the European Commission under the agriculture de minimis rules, which provide for a maximum payment per undertaking of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  Applications for the PEPS closed on 20 March 2022. The first tranche of payments was made last week, with the remaining applications due for processing as soon as possible. All information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  This scheme is part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.</p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the  options potentially available to them. </p>  <p>  There is also support for access to finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), particularly the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Both of these SBCI finance products, which are part-financed by my Department, can be used for working capital and include features which will assist the current financial needs of pig farmers.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Department continues to engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, including through the European Food Security Crisis preparedness response Mechanism (EFSCM). Last week the Commission announced the adoption of exceptional support measures across the agriculture sector, along with a communication on Food Security. In addition, the Commission in view of the particularly difficult situation in the pig meat sector has opened a new private storage aid scheme to assist in stabilising the sector.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently examining the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to the exceptional aid allocation to Ireland of &euro;15.8 million in EU funding.</p></reply>

It is likely that the disease was introduced into Ireland on infected plants for use in either forest, farm or roadside planting.</p>  <p>  The experience of ash dieback disease provides clear evidence of the increasing threat to our plant health status through a combination of trade and climate change. </p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine has taken a number of significant steps in response to this experience, including the publication of its Plant Health and Biosecurity Strategy, the establishment of a new area of expertise in the Department in Pest Risk Analysis and in financial support to growers impacted to allow them to remove infected ash and replace it with other suitable species. I understand that a small percentage of the ash population thought to be 1%-2% may be disease tolerant. The Department has and continues to support a number of research initiatives in order to identify tolerant ash trees for use in ash breeding programmes for the future.</p>  <p>  Since the first finding of ash dieback disease in Ireland, the Department has provided support totalling over &euro;7 million to owners of ash plantations impacted by ash dieback disease through the ash dieback reconstitution scheme (introduced in 2013) and more recently the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS &ndash; Ash dieback) introduced in July 2020.</p>  <p>  Applications for that scheme are received regularly and decisions are issued as the assessment of the applications are complete.  To date, my Department has received 574 applications covering 2,325ha </p>  <p>  and has issued 178 decisions for 575ha.</p>  <p>  The Forestry Licensing Plan 2022 was published earlier this year and deals with projected licensing output and approvals for support schemes and  may be found at gov.ie - Forestry Licensing Plan 2022 (www.gov.ie), A key target of the plan is to refocus of the delivery on approvals from the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) (Ash Dieback).  Many RUS applications  are screened in for Appropriate Assessment and are referred to ecology.  Of these, any that propose replacing the ash crop with conifer species currently require planning permission.  The Department is engaging with the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH), to explore the possibility of removing the planning permission requirement for such files, subject to compliance with existing EU laws and regulations. </p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to work with its counterparts in the DHLGH, on progressing this issue.</p>  <p>  The current scheme provides 100% grant aid to landowners to clear their ash crop, replant with an alternate species and manage their forest until successfully established.  While farmers have an option to switch to a range of forest types including agroforestry there are currently no plans to introduce measures supporting the change of land use to non forestry uses</p></reply>

The total allocation for the full suite of seven TAMS measures including the Low Emission Slurry Spreading Scheme (or LESS) for the transitional period to the end of 2022 is now &euro;507 million plus &euro;96 million under the European Recovery Instrument (EURI) for 2021 to 2023. To date, expenditure under TAMS has exceeded &euro;337 million. </p>  <p>  There are tremendous benefits for LESS equipment in achieving our environmental goals which is why these investments have particular flexibilities under TAMS. Uniquely among the suite of seven TAMS measures, the LESS measure is not subject to the overall TAMS investment ceiling of &euro;80,000. A separate investment ceiling of &euro;40,000 is available in respect of LESS. Uptake under this measure has been significantly greater than originally expected with over 8,800 applications approved to date. Payments of over &euro;56.6m have issued in respect of LESS equipment to date.</p>  <p>  In relation to the LESS approvals, the time period in which a payment claim must be submitted in respect of LESS equipment was extended from 6 months from the date of approval to 12 months. This change was made in order to address the issue of supply. In relation to further extensions, these are made available on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  TAMS extension requests can be submitted to the email address provided on the individual farmer's approval letter between the 11th and 12th month of the approval. Extensions before the 11th month of an approval expires may continue to be submitted on the online extension request system. All requests must include the required supporting documentation. </p>  <p>  As regards derogation farmers, the 4th Nitrates Action Programme provided for compulsory usage of LESS equipment for all farmers operating above 170 kg N/ha. Earlier this month the 5th Nitrates Action Programme was signed into law by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  In order to meet our ammonia and Ag Climatise targets, the compulsory implementation of LESS is being extended to more farmers under the 5th Nitrates Action Programme.  This is being done on a phased basis. </p>  <p>  Ireland's draft CAP Strategic Plan 2023 &ndash; 2027 which lists the range of interventions currently being proposed, was submitted to the EU Commission on 31st December 2021.</p></reply>

This new Forestry Programme will focus on the importance of climate smart forestry and new afforestation will be encouraged in pursuit of climate, water, biodiversity and commercial objectives.   </p>  <p>  Trees sequester carbon and have significant importance in the fight against climate change. The planting of trees has the potential to play a significant part in our environmental priorities and as a space for nature. In accordance with the targets set out in the Climate Action Plan, the Government will continue to promote afforestation to increase planting to a rate consistent with realising our 2030 climate ambition and to contribute to achieving carbon neutrality no later than 2050.  </p>  <p>  To achieve this, my Department fully recognises the need for afforestation to be complementary to CAP. Newly planted forestry will continue to qualify for the new Basic Income Support Payment, subject to the underlying rules for eligibility for the afforestation Single Payment Scheme (SPS). It will also be eligible for an Eco-scheme per hectare  payment subject to compliance with that schemes Terms and Conditions. My Department has also proposed in the CAP Strategic Plan that was submitted to the European Commission on the 31 December 2021, that forestry, whether eligible for SPS or not would also be counted in the calculation of a farmer's Space for Nature percentage.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the CAP Strategic Plan, tree planting actions have been included in both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2. The new Eco-Scheme (Pillar 1) includes a tree planting option as part of the menu of options that farmers can choose from. The Pillar II Agri-Environment Climate Measure (AECM) includes under the general option various tree planting actions to benefit specific objectives, such as water quality, biodiversity and climate. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the planting of trees or participation on agroforestry or native woodland establishment schemes will qualify the applicant for higher status in ranking and selection thereby giving the applicant a greater chance of being awarded an AECM contract. In addition, the AECM also provides for the preparation of a farm sustainability plan. In the preparation of this plan, farmers can discuss the appropriate actions for their farm with their Agricultural Advisor, including the identification of areas suitable for tree planting actions.</p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that it is my objective to increase and encourage interest in small scale planting by removing the licensing requirement for areas not greater than one hectare, which may prove to be a barrier to such planting and be considered onerous and complex. Such an exemption would be available as part of a scheme which my Department intends to design and implement once the Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which provides for the required amendment to the Forestry Act 2014 is enacted.</p></reply>

In allocating fishing opportunities, the CFP requires Member States to apply transparent and objective criteria, such as the contribution to the local economy.  </p>  <p>  A system of transferable fishing concessions allows for a Member State's quota to be allocated to an individual fisher or group of fishers which is available to them to transfer, lease or sell  to other vessel owners, this is commonly known as an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system .  </p>  <p>  The last reform of the CFP set out the option for Member States to introduce ITQ system for their fleets.  The European Commission had proposed that such a system be mandatory for all Member States.  Ireland was successful in strongly opposing  a mandatory ITQ system, on the basis that it would inevitably lead to a concentration of ownership in a small number of international fishing companies with little or no links to Ireland's fishing communities.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland, fish quotas are a public resource owned by the State and are made available to fishing vessels based on an overall policy framework which has been developed over the past 30 years.  The result of this long-standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet has retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities and has delivered economic activity including vital employment in these communities, where there are very limited alternative economic activities. </p>  <p>  I am firmly of the view that system of quota management must  remain within a Member State's competence and must not be determined at EU level.   The Government is fully committed to maintaining our quotas in public ownership to the benefit of our fishing fleet and coastal communities.</p></reply>

This scheme will support the deployment of an expected 380 MW of new micro (50 kW) to support the deployment of rooftop and ground-mounted solar PV. Landowners and farmers in particular will benefit from the move to renewables as set out under Food Vision 2030  - which clearly recognises that the agriculture sector has a key role to play in helping Ireland meet its renewable energy targets. </p>  <p>  To encourage on-farm renewable technology uptake and usage, grant aid is provided through TAMS to assist farmers in maximising their contribution to the production of renewable energy through the installation of Solar PV technology along with battery storage on Irish farms.

I heard directly from representative groups at recent meetings about the impacts of the high fuel prices on the profitability of fishing.  The Government is also very conscious of the impacts of high fuel costs on many other sectors of the economy.</p><p>On 23 March 2022, the European Commission published its &lsquo;<i>Temporary Crisis Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy following the aggression against Ukraine by Russia</i>&rsquo;.  The purpose of the Temporary Crisis Framework is to specify the criteria for the assessment by the Commission of the compatibility with the internal market of State Aid measures that Member States may take to remedy the economic effects arising from the war and related market disruption.  The Framework provides that the Commission will consider temporary limited amounts of aid to undertakings affected to be compatible with the internal market provided that certain conditions are met.  A State Aid Notification is required for any measure proposed. </p><p>In relation to primary producers in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors, the Framework provides a State Aid basis for Member States to propose in a State Aid Notification a support scheme for undertakings affected, granting aid no later than 31 December 2022 and to a maximum of &euro;35,000 per undertaking.  Of course, such a scheme has to demonstrate that the aid proposed is proportionate to the impacts on the undertakings concerned.</p><p>Separately, on 25 March 2022, the European Commission adopted a Commission Decision under article 26 of the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund Regulation (2021/1139), recognising  in accordance with that article the Ukraine war as an 'exceptional events causing a significant disruption of markets'.  That Commission Decision facilitates Member States in using, if they so choose, article 26 as a basis to make available compensation under their EMFAF Programmes to operators in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors for their income foregone or additional costs related to the exceptional event, or alternatively to provide aid to producer organisations for storage aid, a market support mechanism that aids the freezing and cold storage of fish in periods of market turbulence and its subsequent release to the market when matters improve.

There are challenges both for younger farmers becoming established and older farmers having concerns about future income, taxation, the suitability of collaborators and the retirement process itself.  </p>  <p>  The new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) cites generational renewal as one of its nine key objectives, while it is also prominent in Food Vision 2030, the new stakeholder-led strategy for the agri-food sector. Food Vision proposes a number of actions, including maintaining the strong level of current support; the promotion of land mobility and succession planning; and increased education &amp;amp; promotion of the diversity of careers in the agri-food sector. This reflects the need for skilled and innovative young farmers to respond to societal demands for quality food and environmental public goods. Supporting younger and older farmers therefore remains a key policy objective. </p>  <p>  Given this, as the Deputy may be aware, there are a range of measures in place at present &ndash; both in the existing CAP and at national level &ndash; that support younger farmers and facilitate generational renewal. Under the current CAP, this includes the Young Farmers Scheme under the current CAP, the National Reserve, the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme and support to establish Collaborative Farming arrangements. Further assistance is available from national supports including through taxation measures such as the Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty exemptions, Stock Relief and Long-Term Leasing Relief, as well as the availability of tax credits via the Succession Farm Partnerships. Such interventions, which are available to all sectors including dairy, provide vital supports to young farmers in setting up their enterprises and older farmers wishing to retire. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s draft CAP Strategic Plan proposals reaffirm our commitment to generational renewal, with a number of proposals currently under review by the European Commission. This includes a new initiative to support advice for older farmers on succession and retirement options.</p>  <p>  I recently established the Food Vision Dairy Group, which brings together key stakeholders to advance the actions for the dairy sector identified in the strategy, with the action &ldquo;produce a detailed plan by Q2 2022 to manage the sustainable environmental footprint of the dairy sector&rdquo; as a priority. I expect that an interim report from the Group will be submitted to me shortly. </p>  <p>  I want to ensure that the dairy and wider agri-food sector remain strong and sustainable into the future, and will continue to engage with stakeholders to find the best approaches to support young farmers to ensure a bright future for the sector.</p></reply>

These factors, and others, are likely to result in increases in price for consumer staples at wholesale and retail level.</p><p>The effect of these impacts is being felt most sharply in the intensive pig and poultry sectors, where feed costs represent a very significant portion of overall productions costs. Teagasc is providing bespoke advice to pig farmers. </p><p>The Department is in contact with the main banks on an ongoing basis in relation to the challenge facing pig farmers; the finance instruments funded by my Department through SBCI offer an important source of flexible low-cost finance.  </p><p>I established an emergency aid scheme for pig farmers of &euro;7 million which opened for applications on 7th March. This will provide commercial pig farmers a payment of up to &euro;20,000 each. The first payments to pig farmers under this scheme began to issue last week. </p><p>I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee and tasked it with preparing an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. I am committed to supporting the work of the Committee in the weeks ahead. </p><p>Within my Department, I established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p><p>I have been assured that there is a sufficient supply of animal feedstuffs and fertiliser in the country, although at elevated prices, for the next number of months. My Department is in regular contact with feed merchants and fertiliser importers to ensure any disruption to supply chains is kept to a minimum.</p><p>At EU level I continue to work with colleagues through the Agri-Fish Council to respond to the impacts of the crisis on the sector across Europe.</p><p>On 23rd March, the European Commission announced a communication on food security, and a package of measures to assist the sector including a &euro;500 million package to support farmers most affected. This includes an allocation of &euro;15.8 million for Ireland, which can be topped up by national funding.  I will be examining ways to best mobilise this support as soon as possible, taking account of the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this exceptional aid provision.  </p><p>The EU package also includes plans to deploy market safety net measures to support specific markets, including private storage aid for pigmeat.</p><p>By working collectively and collaboratively, I am determined to ensure that the sector is insulated against the worst of what might come from supply chain disruptions. </p><p>I am taking a proactive approach to supporting our farm families and their businesses throughout this period. It is one of the biggest challenges our sector has faced in recent years and I am committed to supporting our farm families throughout this period.</p></reply>

In March 2021, I established a Task Force to examine the impacts of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) between the European Union and the United Kingdom on our fishing sector and coastal communities, and to make recommendations to me on initiatives that could be taken to provide supports for development and restructuring so as to ensure a profitable and sustainable fishing fleet and to identify opportunities for jobs and economic activity in coastal communities dependent on fishing.</p><p>I received the <i>Report of the Seafood Task Force &ndash; Navigating Change</i>on 11th October 2021 and it recommends a suite of 16 support schemes at a total cost of &euro;423 million. A number of recommendations have already been implemented and on 25<sup>th</sup>March 2022 I was pleased to announce the implementation of two further recommendations, in the form of the Brexit Blue Economy Enterprise Development Scheme and the Brexit Inshore Marketing Scheme.</p><p>The remaining recommendations of the Task Force are being urgently examined across Government with regard to available funds, eligibility of the recommended measures for funding under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve and with regard to State Aid rules and the Public Spending Code.  This complex process, that needs to be undertaken on a phased and prioritised basis as recommended by the Task Force, is very well advanced.</p><p>The report included a recommendation, for a capital investment scheme for seafood processing enterprises, which is currently going through this process. The scheme is aimed at mitigating the significant loss of raw material supply due to TCA quota cuts, and Brexit impacts on traditional imports of raw material from the UK, through increased, graduated grant aid rates.</p><p>I am very conscious of the tight timeframe for supports under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p></reply>

Generational renewal is critical to ensure a bright future for the agri-food sector. We must ensure we take every step to support our young farmers to ensure the best and the brightest enter the sector and can flourish.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there are a range of measures both in the existing CAP and at national level that support younger farmers and facilitate generational renewal. Under the current CAP, the Young Farmers Scheme with payments of &euro;120m benefitting over 8,000 farmers each year, and the National Reserve with &euro;38 million allocated since 2015, provide financial support to young farmers during the crucial early years of setting up a farm enterprise. </p>  <p>  Additionally, under the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, young farmers can avail of a 60% grant rate as compared to the standard rate of 40% and over &euro;150m has been paid to over 6,000 young farmers to date. Additional support to young farmers is provided under the Collaborative Farming Grant Scheme. These partnership structures are further supported through the availability of a tax credit at national level of &euro;25,000 over five years to assist with the transfer of farms within &ldquo;Succession Farm Partnerships&rdquo;, promoting and supporting the earlier intergenerational transfer of family farms.</p>  <p>   In addition, at national level, strong taxation measures assist land mobility and facilitate succession and are worth some &euro;200 million per annum. Long-Term Leasing Income Tax Relief has been an important driver of land mobility by providing access to land and security of tenure for younger farmers and a route to retirement for older farmers. Almost 11,000 beneficiaries were supported under this measure in 2018 costing &euro;27.2 million.</p>  <p>  On access to finance, the Future Growth Loan Scheme was developed with assisting young farmers among its objectives and has been in great demand, with some 1,300 loans to the value of &euro;150 million sanctioned to farmers. </p>  <p>  In addition, Teagasc's education activities continue to focus on equipping young farmers with the necessary knowledge to build successful careers.</p>  <p>  In terms of the new CAP Strategic Plan (CSP), as the Deputy will be aware, my Department and I have been actively engaging with stakeholders throughout the process of developing the new plan. The draft CAP Strategic Plan is currently under consideration by the European Commission.  Over the month of March, my Department has hosted a series of information meetings to inform farmers of the changes proposed in the CAP from 2023. More information including a recent webinar and an online calculator for changes to direct payments is available online on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  Under the draft CSP proposals, Ireland will implement the Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme in the new CAP programme, dedicating some 3% of the direct payments ceiling to help young farmers establish their farming businesses. This allocation of approximately &euro;35m per year will see qualifying young farmers benefit on a per hectare basis which will be more advantageous to young farmers than the current system, which was linked to payment entitlements. </p>  <p>  The proposed rate will significantly increase from approximately &euro;70/ha in the current programme to over &euro;170/ha, with a maximum payment area of 50 hectares and payment on all eligible hectares, even those without corresponding entitlements. In tandem with this, we will also implement the National Reserve in each year of the new CAP to fund at a minimum the mandatory categories of young farmers and new entrants to farming.</p>  <p>  In addition, a higher grant rate for qualified young farmers is proposed under the capital investment measure proposed under the CSP. The CSP will also continue to provide support for collaborative farming and will propose innovative ways to advise older farmers on succession and retirement options, which will increase the availability of land for younger farmers.</p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting initiatives to facilitate generational renewal and will continue to engage with stakeholders to find the best approaches to support young farmers to ensure a bright future for the sector.</p></reply>

The CAP Strategic Plan is expected to make a key contribution to accomplishing the anticipated goals of the Nature Restoration Regulation.  This will be reflected in the reporting of CAP indicators such as farmland bird populations, enhanced biodiversity protection and ecosystem service provision as well as enhanced carbon sequestration by farmers, all of which are expected to align with the Nature Restoration Law objectives. </p>  <p>  In line with the increasing importance being placed on biodiversity, my Department has expanded its capacity in this area over recent years through the recruitment of a number of ecologists and the allocation of additional resources to deal with climate change as well as biodiversity.

The project also incorporates strong representation internationally from the UK and the Netherlands.</p>  <p>  While this is a five year project, I believe the close collaboration between the researchers involved and the industry stakeholders will ensure the timely dissemination of relevant research findings throughout the life of the project.</p>  <p>  With regard to the harvesting of peat domestically for horticultural purposes, my Department has no role in the regulation of peat extraction. There is no ban on peat extraction and there is a regulatory framework in place that provides a legal route for peat extraction to take place. It is the responsibility of peat extractors to ensure that they engage with the regulatory system and meet their obligations under EU law.</p>  <p>  In January of this year I announced a working paper that sets out a series of actions to support the horticultural growers who are dependent on peat as a growing medium. One of the key actions identified a need for expert planning assistance for peat extractors to enable extractors to comply with the regulatory for peat extraction and all relevant EU environmental laws and obligations. </p>  <p>  As a consequence my Department has recruited experts to prepare focused regulatory guidance on planning to assist those wishing to extract peat in the medium term for horticulture growers. This work is currently under way. </p>  <p>  This expert guidance document, when published, will provide a valuable resource to those seeking legal compliance for the abstraction of horticultural peat on sub-30 hectare bogs for supply to the domestic horticulture industry.</p></reply>

The total package is projected to cost in the region of &euro;12.2 million.</p>  <p>  The package seeks to incentivise the planting of additional tillage crops for this coming planting season through the Tillage Incentive Scheme. The Scheme encourages farmers to grow more tillage crops in 2022 versus 2021 and for crops to be eligible, the land must not have been in tillage production in 2021. Eligible crops include the cereal crops- barley, wheat, oats etc., oilseed rape, maize, beet and potatoes. A payment of &euro;400 per hectare is proposed. The proposed budget for the Scheme is &euro;10 million and is aimed at encouraging an additional 25,000 hectares of tillage crops. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the extra tonnage likely to be generated from cereal growing in 2022 as we are some time away from harvest and weather coupled with growing conditions for the spring and summer as well as at harvest time will determine the harvest yields and quality.

These factors, and others, are likely to result in increases in price for consumer staples at wholesale and retail level. </p>  <p>  The effect of these impacts is being felt most sharply in the intensive pig and poultry sectors, where feed costs represent a very significant portion of overall productions costs.

We are in regular contact with feed merchants and fertiliser importers to ensure any disruption to supply chains is kept to a minimum. </p>  <p>  At EU level, I continue to work with colleagues through the Agri-Fish Council to respond to the impacts of the crisis on the sector across Europe.

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the fourth largest agri-food sector, behind beef and dairy, and supports approximately 8,000 rural job.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. </p>  <p>  This scheme was a one off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021 inclusive.

The Government also remains resolute in its solidarity and support and will continue to co-ordinate a humanitarian, economic and diplomatic response to the crisis. </p>  <p>  As a nation and as a farming sector, we stand firmly behind the people of Ukraine and we are working hard to support our farm families and their businesses here.  </p>  <p>  Significant implications are being seen across all sectors, including the agri-food sector. As well as the immediate humanitarian crisis, which must take priority, we need to take the necessary steps to ensure that food security is maintained, for EU citizens, for the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context. </p>  <p>  At farm level, the crisis is already impacting on the price of animal feed, fertiliser and fuel. Within my Department, I established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis. </p>  <p>  I also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc and tasked it to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. </p>  <p>  On 22nd March, the Government approved my proposal for a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative, worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers. This package is aimed at producing more native crops and reducing dependency on imports, and on producing crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser. </p>  <p>  An emergency aid scheme for pig farmers of &euro;7 million opened for applications on 7 March. This will provide commercial pig farmers a payment of up to &euro;20,000 each.

Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine has led to significant hikes in energy, feed and fertiliser prices and significant concerns around supply chain disruption. This is being felt at farm level and is something that I am acutely aware of.</p>  <p>  I met with the main farm organisations and Teagasc on 8th March to discuss the impact on Irish agriculture and supply chains. At that meeting, I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee and tasked it to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. This Group continues to meet and I continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on these significant challenges.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, I also established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  I raised concerns in relation to the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on agri-food supply chains, and especially on input costs at the extraordinary informal meeting of European Union Agriculture Ministers held on 2nd March.  I underlined the need for market support and the need to maintain supply chains and to ensure an effective and functioning Single Market. </p>  <p>  At the AgriFish Council of 21st March, I asked the EU Commission, as part of its work on monitoring markets, to keep a very close eye on supply chains across the EU and to be ready to consider any measures that may help to alleviate the difficulties caused. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission is considering bringing in a private storage aid scheme for the pigmeat sector, as well as allowing other exceptional measures at Member State level to respond to market disturbances.</p>  <p>  I launched the 2022 Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at Teagasc&rsquo;s Ballyhaise College in January in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  This is a credible roadmap that will help farmers reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser. </p>  <p>  Teagasc has also recently issued revised advice to farmers on the recommended application amounts of fertilisers for silage fields to reflect the increase in fertiliser price.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported feed, I announced a package of targeted interventions for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers on 22nd March. The package supports the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards lowering demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  I continue to closely monitor the evolving situation and is actively engaging with the EU Commission, across Government and with industry as this situation unfolds. This is period of considerable challenge for our sector. I have taken a proactive approach to supporting our farm families and their businesses and I will continue to do so.</p></reply>

Stakeholders submitted a total of 45 submissions.</p><p>The Request for Tenders (RFT) seeking service providers to carry out this study was published on 8<sup>th</sup>July 2021 through a competitive public procurement procedure and five tenders were received. In November 2021, I appointed 'The Agile Executive,' a consortium of experts from Munster Technological University and Donegal Yarns, to conduct this study.</p><p>The Agile Executive has been contracted to conduct the review in accordance with the Terms of Reference and has also been asked to review the submissions received during the public consultation process. The final report, following the conclusion of the review, will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p>I am confident that the this important review of the potential demand for wool based products and the recommendations in the upcoming report will aid the development of a strong policy framework for the Irish wool industry and will also identify new opportunities to develop value-added products from Irish wool that are both environmentally and economically sustainable, further contributing to the Irish Circular Bio-economy.</p></reply>

In 2020, I launched the Department's first stand-alone animal welfare strategy, with the specific aim of delivering on key animal welfare issues as set out in the programme for government.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of the Pig Welfare Directive and specifically the matter of tail docking, in the last two years, my Department has implemented specific actions to deal with this issue, and work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Since 2020, trained veterinary inspectors have implemented a programme of specifically designed on-farm pig welfare inspections. These inspections identify the risk factors for tail biting on farms visited and give farmers the opportunity to address them and start rearing pigs with intact tails. This is an important step towards compliance with the EU legislation on tail docking.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has collaborated with Animal Health Ireland and Teagasc to deliver a free tail biting risk assessment tool for pig farmers. This enables them to work with their own veterinary practitioner to identify farm-specific risk factors for tail biting and to develop an action plan to deal with the risks at pen level. The latest figures show 387 pig farms have availed of this measure which is very encouraging.</p>  <p>  A new round of TAMS will launch shortly. This scheme offers farmers up to &euro;200,000 towards new pig housing infrastructure. The specifications have been scrupulously researched to address issues leading to tail biting such as more space, comfortable flooring and feeding space. I am confident that future housing constructed in line with this specification will enable pigs to be reared without any need for tail docking.</p>  <p>  The pig industry is experiencing a difficult period at the moment, however, I can assure you that my Department remains fully committed to making concrete progress on the issue of compliance with the European Pigs Directive. The pig sector is a crucial one in the agriculture sector and is really important to our overall economy.</p></reply>

The NIFF and its supporting network of six Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums are consultative bodies established to foster industry-led development of proposals for the management of fish stocks within six nautical miles of the Irish shore. Since their inception, the Forums have developed initiatives to protect the future of the inshore sector. The NIFF brought forward the first industry-led Strategy for the sector in 2019 and is now implementing this with support from my Department, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) and other agencies. The Strategy flowed from an extensive consultation process that engaged the inshore sector and other stakeholders.</p><p>In relation to financial supports, my Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme 2014-2020 has made public funding available for the sustainable development of our fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing sectors. This Programme has been providing a range of financial supports to our inshore fishing sector for capital investment on board and ashore, for training and for organisation and capacity building within the sector, while State bodies provide a range of services to the inshore fleet including advisory services and stock conservation supports. The new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund Regulation (2021/1139) was adopted in July 2021 and work is well advanced on preparing my Department's new Seafood Development Programme 2021-2027.  I anticipate that this new Programme will be adopted later in 2022.</p><p>I established the Seafood Sector Task Force last year to examine the implications of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) between the European Union and the UK for the Irish fishing industry and coastal communities. In October 2021, the Task Force, which included stakeholders from the inshore fisheries sector, recommended a range of Brexit support schemes costing &euro;423m. These include the Brexit Inshore Fisheries Business Model Adjustment Scheme which provides payments to inshore fishers to adapt their business operations to the post-Brexit environment. I announced the Brexit Inshore Marketing Scheme on 25 March to support Bord Bia in assisting the inshore fisheries sector to mitigate the impacts of Brexit by growing value in existing markets and developing new markets. A Task Force recommendation on the development of an inshore decommissioning scheme is also being actively examined in consultation with industry stakeholders.</p><p>In the <i>Programme for Government - Our Shared Future</i>, the Government commits to ensuring &ldquo;that inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and recreational fishers and that pair trawling will be prohibited inside the six-mile limit.&rdquo; I am fully supportive of this objective. The Government also committed to supporting the inshore sector with establishing a Producer Organisation to generate greater marketing and promotional capacity. In 2021, my Department recognised the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation as a Producer Organisation. </p><p>My Department is committed to supporting the inshore community and the wider seafood sector in achieving its potential.  I look forward to continuing my engagement with the NIFF and working on how this can be best achieved together.</p></reply>

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. </p>  <p>  This scheme is a once-off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021 inclusive.

It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. </p>  <p>  This scheme is a once-off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021 inclusive. This includes pigs sent to slaughter, exported or sold commercially from a breeding herd. </p>  <p>  The scheme was notified to the European Commission under the agriculture de minimis rules, which provide for a maximum payment per undertaking of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  Applications for the PEPS closed on 20th March 2022.

Such peat might be suitable for mixing by current suppliers to produce a growing medium of value to growers. This work is currently under way. </p>  <p>  I also announced the commissioning of experts to provide focussed regulatory guidance on planning to assist those wishing to extract peat in the medium term for horticulture growers, contracts have been agreed with experts for the preparation of this guidance and this work will start immediately. </p>  <p>  This expert guidance document when published will provide a valuable resource to those seeking legal compliance for the abstraction of horticultural peat on sub-30 hectare bogs for supply to the domestic horticulture industry.</p>  <p>  My Department in also looking towards the future will continue to support and facilitate research in the development of alternatives to peat for horticulture through my Department's Research Calls and through the EU Producer Organisation Scheme for Fruit and Vegetables.  </p></reply>

The Government also remains resolute in its solidarity &amp;amp; support and will continue to co-ordinate a humanitarian, economic and diplomatic response to the crisis. </p>  <p>  Significant implications are being seen across all sectors, including the agri-food sector. As well as the immediate humanitarian crisis, which must take priority, we need to take the necessary steps to ensure that food security is maintained, for EU citizens, for the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context. </p>  <p>  At farm level, the crisis is already impacting very significantly on the price of animal feed, fertiliser and fuel. Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis. </p>  <p>  I have tasked a National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. </p>  <p>  On 22nd March, the Government approved my proposal for a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative, worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers. This package is aimed at producing more native crops and reducing dependency on imports, and on producing crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser. </p>  <p>  An emergency aid scheme for pig farmers of &euro;7 million opened for applications on 7 March. This will provide commercial pig farmers a payment of up to &euro;20,000 each. The first payments to pig farmers under this scheme began to issue last week. </p>  <p>  I am also aware of the particular issues in horticulture and have engaged with the sector. Energy is a significant input for many horticulture enterprises as crops, such as tomatoes, cucumbers and mushrooms, are grown indoors in glasshouses and in protected greenhouse structures. Energy price inflation is obviously an issue across the whole economy and the Government has already taken action and will continue to consider additional measures in this regard.</p>  <p>  As part of my Backing Rural Ireland tour, I met with members of the horticulture sector in north Co Dublin. I was impressed by their skill, determination and braveness. We need to ensure that we have a vibrant domestic horticulture sector. This is something that both I and the Government want to protect. </p>  <p>  At EU level I have met with EU Agriculture Ministers and on 23rd March the European Commission announced a package of measures to assist the sector including a &euro;500 million package to support farmers most affected. This includes an allocation of &euro;15.8 million for Ireland, which can be topped up by national funding.  I will be examining ways to best mobilise this support as soon as possible, taking account of the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this exceptional aid provision.  </p>  <p>  The EU package also includes plans to deploy market safety net measures to support specific markets including private storage aid for pigmeat. </p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with all our stakeholders and will continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis using all of the tools at our disposal.  </p></reply>

Critical to this is the role that research, innovation and knowledge exchange plays in providing the strategies and practices that farmers can implement to reduce the carbon footprint of their farms.</p>  <p>  The Department funds research in this area through national and international competitive funding mechanisms that over the last 6 years have allocated up to &euro;30 million on climate, GHG emission mitigation and climate-related co-benefit research. Coupled to this is the grant-in-aid allocation to Teagasc, such as the &euro;147m provided in 2021, which is directed towards research and farmer advisory activities related to climate-smart and sustainable agriculture.</p>  <p>  Examples of projects funded by my Department which will feed into knowledge and strategies to reduce farm carbon footprints include:  </p>  <p>  - &lsquo;Farm-Carbon&rsquo; which is exploring the contribution of on farm hedgerows and non-forest woodland to carbon stocks in agricultural landscapes. </p>  <p>  - &lsquo;SQUARE&rsquo;, which includes identifying soils that have a high capacity to sequester carbon.</p>  <p>  - &lsquo;SmartGrass&rsquo; and &lsquo;SmartSward&rsquo; which researched multi-species swards, and also served to inform the recently announced Multi-species Sward Measure as part of a support package to farmers worth &euro;12m.</p>  <p>  More recently, the strong commitment of my Department to research in support of reducing carbon footprints was further demonstrated by last year&rsquo;s national research call, where over &euro;12 million in funding awards was made to 10 projects in climate and environment related research, accounting for 60% of the overall spend in this call. One of the projects funded, &lsquo;LAB-MACC&rsquo;, will quantify mitigation associated with a range of new measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance land carbon sinks, and displace fossil fuel emissions, while another, &lsquo;REWET&rsquo;, will investigate how developing actions to restore the water table on drained carbon-rich soils can enhance carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere.</p>  <p>  The Food Vision 2030 Strategy also points to the need for Irish research to build partnerships and collaboration internationally. This is an area that my Department has been active in. In 2021 for example, up to &euro;2.5million was committed through European initiatives to research calls in the areas of GHG emission reduction and soil Carbon sequestration. We have also been longstanding members of the Global Research Alliance for Agricultural Greenhouse Gasses and more recently, have partnered on the United States-United Arab Emirates led initiative, the &lsquo;Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate&rsquo;, which will lead to an increased investment in climate related research. </p>  <p>  Considering the wide range of research initiatives that are taking place and the ambitious recommendations for the role of research into the future under Food Vision 2030, I am confident that a strong pipeline of scientific advancements and knowledge is in place, which will help farmers to reduce the carbon footprint of their farms, while also contributing to a sustainable and resilient sector over the next decade.</p></reply>

There are derogations to this access rule, including restrictions on access to Member States' coastal waters.   </p>  <p>  Quotas for the various stocks are allocated for management areas - that is, an ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Seas) area or a part thereof - and not Member States' EEZs.  Generally, most stock areas straddle more than one EEZ area. These stock areas can include Member States' EEZs, third countries' EEZs and international waters. </p>  <p>  For example, the Total allowable Catch (TAC) area for the Hake Stock is ICES Areas 6 and 7 which stretches from the north of Scotland south to the north coast of Brittany, and into the English channel.   This area includes parts of the UK EEZ, the Irish EEZ, part of the French EEZ and some international waters.  Ireland's quota may be fished in any part of this area.  Ireland's main Mackerel quota covers ICES Areas 6 and 7 stretching from north of Scotland to the north coast of Brittany and the full quota may be fished in UK waters of the northern North Sea.  The access to the northern North Sea in particular is economically important for our fleet.   </p>  <p>  The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first CFP in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record).  The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, based on a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU.  The share out of TACs set in more recent years has also been mainly based on track record, the most recent of these of importance to Ireland has been boarfish. </p>  <p>  The details of the stocks for which Ireland has quota are set out in the TAC and Quota Regulation each year.  </p></reply>

This makes us truly unique. The family farm model is one that I support and one that I will continue to support. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food sector comes together on a regular basis to plan for the future, typically every five years, with a 10-year horizon. This process is facilitated by, but independent of, my Department. In late 2019, a Committee of 32 members representative of the sector with an independent Chair, Tom Arnold, was established and tasked with developing the new strategy. </p><p>The terms of reference were to outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions, required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agri-food sector in the decade ahead. The Committee held 13 meetings and following the publication of a draft Strategy and associated environmental assessments for public consultation in April, Food Vision 2030 was published in August last year. </p><p>Food Vision 2030, sets out an ambitious blueprint for the sector for the years ahead, supporting family farms and employment in rural Ireland and adding value sustainably into the future, with a strategic focus on environmental protection. </p><p>One of the standout aspects of Food Vision is its adoption of a food systems approach. A food systems approach involves considering the interconnectivity of the food system with the environment and with nutrition &amp;amp; health. A sustainable food system delivers food security and nutrition for all, in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised. </p><p>Food Vision aims for Ireland to be a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems. It consists of 22 Goals, which are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goals are grouped into four high level missions for the sector to work towards.</p><p>1. A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector</p><p>2. Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being</p><p>3. Food that is safe, nutritious and appealing: trusted and valued at home and abroad</p><p>4. An Innovative, Competitive  and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, driven by Technology and Talent. </p><p>There are over 200 recommended actions to achieve these goals and missions.</p><p>A Monitoring and Implementation Framework detailing oversight and monitoring mechanisms for implementation, including the establishment of a High Level Implementation Committee chaired by me, is a key part of the Strategy. </p><p>Implementation of Food Vision 2030 is already underway, with many of its actions already commenced. I recently chaired the second High-Level Implementation Committee meeting of Food Vision 2030, where we discussed progress on implementing key Food Vision priorities, including the work of a new Food Vision Environmental Group and a Food Vision Dairy Group.</p><p>Food Vision is a landmark for the Irish agri-food sector and has the potential to transform the agriculture, food, forestry and marine sectors in the period to 2030, with sustainability at its core. The Strategy is honest and upfront about the challenges ahead. Crucially, it proposes solutions and charts a pathway to sustainability in all its dimensions &ndash; environmental, economic and social.</p></reply>

Following recent discussions at EU level, the European Commission announced on Wednesday 23rd March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs. The communication sets out actions in three areas:</p><p>- First, it presents immediate actions to safeguard food security in Ukraine and around the world.</p><p>- Second, it addresses the challenge of food stability in the EU's food system, with a range of measures to support our farmers and maintain affordability for our citizens.</p><p>- Finally, it confirms the EU agenda to make our food system sustainable and resilient in the years to come.</p><p>  It includes &euro;500 million to support farmers most affected and agreement to deploy measures to support specific markets and allow for increased levels of advances of direct payments later this year. Other actions approved included a new self-standing Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF) for state aid and allowing Member States to derogate from certain greening obligations in 2022 to bring additional agricultural land into production. It includes an allocation of &euro;15.8 million for Ireland, which can be topped up by national funding.</p><p>  I am examining ways to best mobilise this support as soon as possible, taking account of the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this exceptional aid provision. The EU package also includes plans to deploy market safety net measures to support specific markets including private storage aid for pigmeat. I will continue to engage with all our stakeholders and will continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. </p><p>  At farm level, the crisis is already impacting very significantly on the price of animal feed, fertiliser and fuel. Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis. </p><p>I also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc and tasked it to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. </p><p>On 22nd March, the Government approved my proposal for a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative, worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers. This package is aimed at producing more native crops and reducing dependency on imports, and on producing crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser.</p><p>  In addition, on the future of Ireland's agri-food sector generally, you will be aware that the new Food Vision 2030 strategy was launched last August. Food Vision is a landmark for the Irish agri-food sector and is honest and upfront about the challenges ahead. Crucially, it proposes solutions and charts a pathway to sustainability in all its dimensions. Food Vision aims for Ireland to be a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems, which would deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, environmental and social basis to generate food and nutrition for future generations are not compromised. This will deliver significant benefits for the Irish agri-food sector itself, for Irish society and the environment.</p><p>I am taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine. We must protect our farm families and their businesses through this period of significant upheaval.</p></reply>

Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine has led to significant hikes in energy, feed and fertiliser prices and significant concerns around supply chain disruption.  </p>  <p>  I met with the main farm organisations and Teagasc on 8th March to discuss the impact on Irish agriculture and supply chains. </p>  <p>  At that meeting I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.

I underlined the need for market support and the need to maintain supply chains and to ensure an effective and functioning Single Market. </p>  <p>  At the AgriFish Council of 21st March, I asked the EU Commission, as part of its work on monitoring markets, to keep a very close eye on supply chains across the EU and to be ready to consider any measures that may help to alleviate the difficulties caused. The EU Commission is considering bringing in a private storage aid scheme for the pigmeat sector, as well as allowing other exceptional measures at Member State level to respond to market disturbances.</p>  <p>  I launched the 2022 Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at Teagasc&rsquo;s Ballyhaise College in January in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  This credible roadmap, which I tasked Teagasc in developing, will help alleviate reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser in the longer-term. Teagasc has also recently issued revised advice to farmers on the recommended application amounts of fertilisers for silage fields to reflect the increase in fertiliser price.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported feed, I announced a package of targeted interventions for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers on 22nd March. The package supports the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards lowering demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to closely monitor the evolving situation and is actively engaging with the EU Commission, across Government and with industry as this situation unfolds.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I am committed to supporting our farm families and their businesses through very challenging period.  </p></reply>

This land use evidence review is also noted in Chapter 17.3.4 (pp 172 and 173) of the Climate Action Plan (Nov 2021).  </p><p>The review balances environmental social and economic conditions and will involve a process of evaluation of the ecological characteristics of the land, consideration of emissions to air and water, carbon sequestration and climate adaption challenges.  </p><p>The review is being overseen by a Steering Committee co-chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine (DAFM) and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) .  The steering committee is made up of representatives from DAFM, DECC, EPA, DHLGH and independent nominees. The Land use review is being carried out in two distinct phases:</p><p><b>Phase 1</b>is an evidential review and is being led by EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and is being guided by a cross-governmental technical steering group.  Phase 1 aims to provide an evidence base to determine an appropriate land use indicator set for Ireland, as well as determining the environmental, ecological, and economic characteristics of land types across Ireland. </p><p>EPA is working with government departments and public sector colleagues to assess the available evidence in the following areas:</p><p>- The impact of current land use on the environment and society</p><p>- The indicators we can use to measure land use impacts on environment and society</p><p>- Environmental and societal trends that will impact on land use</p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s land use stakeholders</p><p>- Commitments and targets in existing policy that impact on land use decisions</p><p>- Land use practices that have proven beneficial to environment and society</p><p>In summary, Phase 1 of the national Land Use Evidence Review will gather data and evidence to report on the environmental, ecological, and socio-economic characteristics and considerations for land use and land-based activities across Ireland, including how they interact with each other: with a view to informing the Policy Development ambitions for Phase 2 of the Evidence Review.

In addition, the price of grain has risen in line with fertiliser prices so relying entirely on imported meal is not a reliable alternative to securing home grown fodder. </p><p>I announced a Targeted Intervention Package on 22<sup>nd</sup>March framed around three pillars to support Irish farming families arising both from events in Ukraine and wider global price volatility. The total package is projected to cost in the region of &euro;12.2 million.The package seeks to incentivise the planting of additional tillage crops for this coming planting season through the Tillage Incentive Scheme and introduces supports to encourage farmers to grow protein crops in 2022. </p><p>Supporting domestic production of tillage and protein crops will reduce Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on imported feed materials. Finally the package includes a Multi-Species Sward Scheme that includes support for red clover, to promote environmentally sustainable methods of farming, and thereby greatly reduce nitrogen fertiliser, while maintaining forage yields.  </p><p>The financial supports outlined will assist farmers in offsetting the significant increases in farm inputs experienced by farmers presently and in assisting to ensure sufficient fodder for winter 2022.  </p><p>I am committed to helping and assisting our farm families and their families through this challenging period.  </p></reply>

The Ukrainian agriculture minister, Roman Leschenko, was invited to speak, via videoconference, at the Agri-Fish Council about the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the agricultural sector. </p><p>My Department has also been engaged at a number of other EU meetings in recent weeks to discuss food security issues, including a meeting of the European Food Security Crisis preparedness and Response Mechanism (EFSCM).</p><p>  Following discussions at these meetings the European Commission announced on Wednesday 23 March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs. The communication sets out actions in three areas:</p><p>- First, it presents immediate actions to safeguard food security in Ukraine and around the world.</p><p>- Second, it addresses the challenge of food stability in the EU's food system, with a range of measures to support our farmers and maintain affordability for our citizens.</p><p>- Finally, it confirms the EU agenda to make our food system sustainable and resilient in the years to come.</p><p>  It includes &euro;500 million to support farmers most affected and agreement to deploy measures to support specific markets and allow for increased levels of advances of direct payments later this year. Other actions approved included a new self-standing Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF) for state aid and allowing Member States to derogate from certain greening obligations in 2022 to bring additional agricultural land into production. It includes an allocation of &euro;15.8 million for Ireland, which can be topped up by national funding.</p><p>I will be examining ways to best mobilise this support as soon as possible, taking account of the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this exceptional aid provision. The EU package also includes plans to deploy market safety net measures to support specific markets including private storage aid for pigmeat.</p><p>  I will continue to engage with all our stakeholders and will continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. </p><p>  I am committed to helping our farm families and their businesses through this period of considerable challenge.</p></reply>

Gender equality is also a key objective of the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals and a priority for me, as Minister. </p>  <p>  I am pleased, therefore, to be proposing the highest level of direct supports for women farmers in any CAP programme in Ireland. In addition to the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) proposal, these include women-only Knowledge Transfer (KT) Groups; and a call under the European Innovation Partnerships (EIP) initiative for proposals to examine women&rsquo;s participation in agriculture.</p>  <p>  On the new CAP Strategic Plan (CSP), the Department has been actively engaging with stakeholders throughout the process of developing the new plan. The SWOT analysis and Needs assessment helped to shape the CSP draft interventions that were then followed by a five-week public consultation in September 2021 with over 1,000 responses received. </p>  <p>  The proposed On-Farm Capital investment Scheme is subject to the formal approval of the European Commission. As outlined in the draft CSP, it provides for a general grant rate of 40% for eligible investments. It is also proposed in the CSP that eligible young farmers and eligible women farmers, who meet the eligibility criteria may qualify for grant aid at a rate of 60%. </p>  <p>  Eligible women farmers are those:</p>  <p>  - Aged between 18 years of age and 66 at any time during the calendar year in which she submits an  application for support;</p>  <p>  - Meet the conditions for being head and having control of the holding;</p>  <p>  - Meets the requirements for the appropriate training and/or skills required at the time of applications.</p>  <p>  Applicants who do not meet the criteria above will remain eligible to submit an application under the On-Farm Capital investment scheme at the standard rate of 40%. </p>  <p>  Measures in the On-Farm Capital investment scheme aim to balance the need to address the issues of both generational renewal and gender balance in farming. Measures in the CSP are complemented by the new stakeholder strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, Food Vision 2030, which recognises the important contribution of women to the sector's long-term sustainability and includes a number of actions to promote and improve gender balance at all levels. It also proposes holding a national dialogue on women in agriculture.</p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18 metres length overall targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was introduced in March 2019 to give effect to the changes.</p>  <p>  A Judicial Review was taken by two applicant fishers challenging the validity of the Policy Directive. On 6th October 2020, the High Court judgment held that the Policy Directive was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect. As the Deputy is aware, I appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal and a full hearing took place on 22nd June 2021. Judgment on the case is reserved.</p>  <p>  I also sought an extension on the stay on the order of the High Court, which was granted by the Court of Appeal on 19th March 2021, reinstating the Policy Directive, and which was extended by the Court of Appeal following the full hearing on 22nd June. On 23rd September 2021, the Court of Appeal refused the Minister&rsquo;s application to continue the stay further. This refusal means that the decision of the High Court stands and the Policy Directive is no longer valid, meaning vessels over 18 metres in length overall have resumed trawling in the waters inside 6 nautical miles.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring 'that inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and recreational fishers and that pair trawling will be prohibited inside the six-mile limit.' I wish to assure the Deputy that I am fully supportive of this objective.</p>  <p>  I am awaiting the decision of the Court of Appeal to inform next steps.

Examples have included:</p><p>- The &lsquo;DETE on Tour&rsquo; initiative where distances cycled by staff as part of their commute, or as part of their own physical activity were logged and combined cumulatively to demonstrate the reduction of the staff&rsquo;s carbon footprint;</p><p>- Couch to 5k, and 5k &ndash; 10K support and advice from the staff running club;</p><p>- A Bike servicing webinar and onsite clinic.</p><p>We have also engaged with the Department of Transport regarding the Cycle Friendly Employer EU certification scheme developed by the European Cyclists&rsquo; Federation.</p><p>The Department has also been a participant in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bike to Work&rdquo; scheme since its introduction in 2009 which encourages staff to cycle to work. There is no cost incurred to the Department&rsquo;s vote in participating in this scheme and the bicycles and any related equipment which qualify under the Scheme are paid for by staff themselves by way of salary sacrifice spread over a single year.</p><p>The Department is also working with the Office of Public Works as part of an upgrade to the basement area of 23 Kildare Street to provide enhanced shower facilities and additional space for bicycles, drying racks and lockers for staff of the Department and staff from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media with whom my Department shares the building. These facilities enhancements will support staff who wish to walk, run or cycle to/from the office as part of their daily commute.</p><p>In addition, the promotion of active travel will continue to feature in our Wellbeing Framework which my Department is currently reviewing and updating to take into account learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolution to hybrid working.</p><p>Active travel and its promotion by the Agencies under the remit of my Department forms part of their day-to-day operations, and as such is a matter for the respective Boards and Chief Executive Officers to determine.</p></reply>

As such, a licence should not have, by association, a monetary value or be tradable on the open market. As quantitative restrictions have been removed from the taxi market and there are no barriers to entry to this industry - other than the obligation to use a wheelchair accessible vehicle (WAV) - it is not clear how the re-sale of licences would deliver benefits to the industry, or members of the public that use these services, especially those who require access to WAVs. Accordingly, no consideration is being given to the introduction of a "buy back" scheme as suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision. All PSO providers are currently in receipt of emergency support funding to compensate for fare revenue loss arising as a result of the impact of Covid-19 on the sector, and the associated fall in passenger numbers (passenger numbers fell to below 10% of 2019 levels at the height of the restrictions in 2020 and 2021). Further, on 25/06/2020 Government approved the introduction of temporary financial supports for the licensed bus sector &ndash; commercial operators (in accordance with EU and national legislation).</p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on all PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO public transport every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares.</p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the estimated cost of waiving public transport fees for persons in possession of a student leap card. to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

It is issued when a vehicle is registered in Ireland and when payment of the initial motor tax has been completed (for both new and imported vehicles) and upon each change of ownership (other than to a motor dealer) thereafter.</p>  <p>  The VRC document is not proof that a vehicle ownership transaction has taken place between parties or the correct vehicle registration tax has been paid on the vehicle. The addition of a tearaway piece from the VRC to be transferred to the new owner as proof of purchase would have no legal basis as proof of transfer of ownership of a vehicle as it would not include cost paid or date of transaction details.</p>  <p>  The proper procedure for proof of ownership of a vehicle requires a receipt or invoice from whom and when you bought the vehicle.

Any operator who is exempt from the licensing regulations due to the nature of their work &ndash; for example, an own account operator &ndash; is, by definition, not a haulier.</p>  <p>  On 15 March 2022, the Government approved an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence. </p>  <p>  In deciding on this targeted, temporary scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for certain other operators also, fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead cost for hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business. </p>  <p>  Given the rapid increase in fuel prices linked to the crisis in Ukraine, the haulage sector reported to the Government a serious risk of cessation of business among haulage companies that would have had significant implications for supply chains into the State, including for essential goods. </p>  <p>  You will be aware that on 9 March 2022, in recognition of rising fuel costs for all citizens and businesses, the Government reduced Excise duty by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil in order to reduce the cost of fuels. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has written to the European Commission to ask what flexibilities might be available on an emergency basis to reduce the tax on fuel. Currently, however, the EU Energy Tax Directive limits the possibility of further reducing the tax on fuel. Specifically, the Directive requires a minimum tax of &euro;0.33 per litre and the measures already decided have reduced the tax on diesel to the minimum. </p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis.</p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure announced on 9 March, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme approved on 15 March 2022, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. However, we must accept that it will not be possible to insulate citizens and businesses from the full impact of these fuel price increases.</p></reply>

Almost every advanced country in the world is in a similar position, with inflation reaching a record high of 5.9 per cent in the euro area in February.</p>  <p>  This pick-up in inflation, ceteris paribus, may reduce the &lsquo;real&rsquo; burden of the outstanding stock of public debt in the short-term. On the other hand, the impact of rising inflation increases the risks related to the trajectory of the debt-to-income ratio and the long-term sustainability of the public finances. </p>  <p>  Firstly, significant rates of inflation can lead to slower economic growth by increasing business and household costs and negatively impacting upon disposable income. As highlighted in the Annual Report of Public Debt in Ireland 2021, published by the Department of Finance, the debt-to-income ratio trajectory is very sensitive to the path of economic activity. As such, a slowdown in output could have a negative impact on the public debt ratio. </p>  <p>  Secondly, given that the European Central Bank&rsquo;s primary objective is to maintain price stability (2 per cent over the medium-term) and that it has signalled its intention to end the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme at the end of March, it is likely that the costs of borrowing will increase. The maturity structure and dominance of fixed rate instruments mean the public debt-to-income ratio trajectory is not particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the interest rate in the short-term. However, higher interest rates now will lead to increases in debt servicing costs down the line. </p>  <p>  More broadly, while the inflationary impact of Russia&rsquo;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine could not have been anticipated, the possibility of such unexpected economic shocks speaks to the need to pursue prudent budgetary policies which provide the fiscal space for Government to respond to unforeseen events.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department will set out updated scenarios for inflation and the debt-to-income ratio as part of comprehensive macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts in the Stability Programme Update, to be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The analysis is conducted using SWITCH, the ESRI&rsquo;s tax-benefit microsimulation model, and ITSim &ndash; an indirect tax microsimulation model developed jointly by the Department of Finance and the ESRI. As with previous years, the Departments' analysis estimates the changes in disposable income compared purely to a pre-Budget position and does not, therefore, adjust for projected inflation.</p>  <p>  The ESRI&rsquo;s own distributional analysis, published on 14 October 2021, does provide an analysis of the Budget&rsquo;s tax and welfare measures against an inflation-adjusted estimate of disposable incomes. The ESRI&rsquo;s October analysis is based upon a projected rate of inflation of 2.2 per cent in 2022 and is available at www.esri.ie/news/budget-2022-measures-compensate-most-households-for-rising-prices.</p>  <p>  The ESRI has not updated this analysis to reflect revised projections for inflation in 2022 and I understand that this presents a number of technical and analytical challenges. However, the ESRI recently published a box in its Quarterly Economic Commentary which examines the distributional effects of inflation through a comparison with projected changes in income growth broken down into contributory components across the income distribution. This analysis has been prepared using inflation rates from January 2021 to January 2022, reflecting an annualised rate of inflation of 5.2 per cent.</p>  <p>  It is evident from the QEC analysis that much of the impact of inflation is expected to be mitigated by income growth, which is projected to stand at 4.8 per cent on average. The analysis finds that earnings growth is the largest single contributor to disposable income growth, but that Budget 2022 is the next largest contributor to household income growth, with larger effects for low-income and elderly households. I also note that the QEC finds that lowest income households benefit most from the Government&rsquo;s overall package of policy changes, namely the tax and welfare policy changes in Budget 2022, the February Cost of Living package, and the March reduction in excise duty.</p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee and was introduced in 2009.</p>  <p>  The cycle to work scheme operates on a self-administration basis. Relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. </p>  <p>  There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers. Therefore the cost of the existing scheme can only be estimates. </p>  <p>  Tax expenditure reports prepared by my Department have estimated the cost in the full years referenced at &euro;4 million but have been clear that this figure was an estimate as separate returns are not required. </p>  <p>  An estimated additional tax expenditure of &euro;0.5m in 2020 and &euro;1.5m in 2021 is expected to arise on foot of the changes made to the scheme by Section 9 of the Financial Provision (Covid-19)(No.2) Act 2020. This increased the allowable expenditure from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500 in respect of  e-bikes and &euro;1,250 in respect of bicycles and allowed the purchase of a new bicycle every 4 years instead of 5.</p></reply>

I am informed by Revenue that it may grant a vehicle temporary exemption from the requirement to register a vehicle in the State for VRT if it is owned or registered abroad by a person established outside the State. In the case of an individual, he/she is established outside the State when he/she has his/her normal residence outside the State.  </p>  <p>  Normal residence, where referenced in Statutory Instrument (S.I.) No. 60/1993, is clearly defined within the S.I. as meaning the place where a person usually lives, that is where she/he lives for at least 185 days in each year because of personal and occupational ties, or, in the case of a person with no occupational ties, because of personal ties. However, the normal residence of a person whose occupational ties are in a different place from her/his personal ties and who consequently lives in turn in different places situated in two or more countries shall be regarded as being the place of her/his personal ties provided that such person returns to the place of her/his personal ties regularly. This proviso shall not apply where the person is living in a country in order to carry out a task of a duration of less than one year. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by Revenue that the criteria for temporary exemption from the registration of vehicles as outlined in S.I. No. 60/1993 does not give any specific weighting to the presence of an individual in the State on any specific days of the month or year. </p>  <p>  &lsquo;Ordinarily resident&rsquo; for tax purposes and &lsquo;normal residence&rsquo; for VRT purposes are defined differently and treated differently.  Tax residence status depends on the number of days a person is present in Ireland during a tax year.</p>  <p>  Section 819 Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 sets out the statutory residence test for tax purposes.  It provides that an individual is resident in the State for tax purposes for a tax year if he or she is present in the State for:</p>  <p>  -  183 days in that tax year, or</p>  <p>  -  280 days between that tax year and the previous tax year, with a minimum of 30 days in each year. </p>  <p>  An individual is regarded as being resident in the State for a day if he or she is present in the State at any time during the day. The fact that an individual may be present in the State on particular days is immaterial for the purposes of these tests.  Instead, it is the total number of days that an individual is present in the State in a tax year that determines if he/she is resident or not for tax purposes for that year. </p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the individual banks to ensure that they are putting their customer first, ensuring fair treatment of customers and that customers understand what the changes mean for them. On 25 June 2021, the Central Bank engaged with all banks on their expectations of how they manage issues and consumer risks during this period of change, and it is actively monitoring compliance with these expectations. </p>  <p>  In 2016, the Central Bank issued a Code of Conduct on the Switching of payment accounts with Payment Service Providers (&ldquo;The Switching Code&rdquo;). The Switching Code is designed to ensure switching accounts is easy and straightforward for the consumer. The Switching Code sets out the process that all Payment Service Providers (including Banks) that offer payment accounts in Ireland are required to follow when a consumer wants to switch accounts. This includes making a switching pack available to customers, timelines for completing the switching process and the actions to be taken by both the existing and new payment service provider when the customer seeks to initiate the switching process.   </p>  <p>  All customers that currently have an account with KBC Bank and Ulster Bank will be notified by their respective bank, with sufficient notice, to switch their accounts and how the banks will assist them to do this. However, customers do not have to wait for their banks to contact them and could decide at an earlier stage to move to alternative providers, in advance of any notice period. Where customers are considering switching in advance of the notice period, they should make contact with their current provider before closing their account to ensure they understand any product benefits that may be related to their existing current account.</p></reply>

In line with Civil Service pay policy, all staff within my Department are paid according to a fixed pay scale for their relevant grade, regardless of gender.</p>  <p>  My Department, through its Secretary General, is a member of the 30% Club, which is a global campaign supported by Board Chairs and CEOs of medium and large organisations committed to achieving better gender balance at leadership levels and throughout their organisation, for better business outcomes. Furthermore, my Department has hosted talks for staff by the 30% Club on achieving gender balance in the public sector.</p>  <p>  State bodies under the aegis of my Department and which have employees have provided the following responses:</p>  <p>  The Central Bank, which also provides staff for the Investor Compensation Company DAC, has been publishing an annual Gender Pay Gap Report since 2018. The published gender pay analysis and profile has been based on annualised base pay effective 1 January each year. All employees are aligned to pay grades which provide for equal pay for equal work irrespective of gender. Their pay structures are informed by public sector guidelines, are fully transparent and published on their website. As at 1 January 2021 in its most recent Gender Pay Gap Report, the gender pay profile is 2.2% in favour of male employees. The Bank is committed to continually reflecting on and enhancing its approach to all aspects of Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion, including undertaking specific targeted actions aimed at improving gender representation and consequently gender pay gap reduction. The Bank will publish its Gender Pay Gap Report 2022 later this year in accordance with the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021. Looking ahead, gender forms a central part of the Bank&rsquo;s Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 2022-2026 and the 2022 Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) has noted the provisions of the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021 and the imminent regulations and will take all necessary steps to ensure its compliance with reporting requirements, both in compliance with the Act and in the interests of transparency. The FSPO also fully recognises its obligations and responsibilities with regards to the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015, and is committed to enabling access to employment for all persons. It operates its recruitment campaigns in compliance with the Codes of Practice for Appointment to Positions in the Civil Service and Public Service and is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for prospective candidates. The FSPO has emphasised the requirement to achieve an inclusive and diverse workplace over the course of the next strategic period. This will include the development of a dedicated HR strategy as well as work to implement identified actions for improvement in accordance with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, whereby the Public Sector Duty places a statutory obligation on public bodies to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect the human rights of to service users and staff alike.</p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is an equal opportunities employer. Salary grading is in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circulars on public sector pay. It&rsquo;s Recruitment Policy and Procedures defines equality of opportunity at the Fiscal Council in respect of recruitment, equality of participation in the workplace and assurance that no one will receive less favourable treatment because of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race or membership of the Traveller community.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) continues the implementation of its Gender Balance Strategy, which focuses on fostering the representation of women at senior levels and enhancing women&rsquo;s professional growth so that it can attract, retain and develop female employees. This is achieved through activities in the areas of learning and development, external partnerships and leave policies. The NTMA continues to monitor and consider initiatives to address possible or potential causes of gender pay disparity. It assigns staff to Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, each of which is also a body under the aegis of my Department.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is an equal opportunities employer. Its recruitment and promotion is undertaken in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 and the code of practice issued by the Commission on Public Service Appointments. Pay rates for all staff are determined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. All staff are remunerated on the basis of incremental salary scales for each grade. There are no bonus payments. In 2021, there was a 50:50 ratio of female to male employees. For the third consecutive year, there was no material, i.e. 2% or more, difference in pay rates for female and male employees of the Office in 2021.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners published in 2020, for the first time, an analysis of their gender pay gap based on 2019 pay and staffing levels. This research documents the pay gap in Revenue and the factors that result in differences in pay levels between men and women. The analysis includes a statistical model that breaks down the gender pay gap into its constituent parts. Gender differences by grade are the leading cause of pay gap in Revenue, as women are over represented at more junior grades, and women are five times more likely to work part-time. The analysis shows there is no unidentified explanation, such as wage discrimination, for the existence of Revenue&rsquo;s gender pay gap. In 2022, Revenue updated this analysis based on 2021 data. &euro;47,800 is the average annual gross pay for men in 2021; for women the average is &euro;42,300. Revenue&rsquo;s gender pay gap in 2021 is estimated to be &euro;5,500 or 12%. Furthermore, the analysis shows that Revenue&rsquo;s gender pay gap is narrowing, it has reduced by a quarter since 2019, from 16% in 2019 to 12% in 2021. </p>  <p>  Revenue has also advised that changing gender shares across grades is identified as a key cause of the stronger pay growth for women and the associated reduction in the pay gap in 2021. The impact of changing grade shares is primarily due to hiring and retirements, with promotion of existing staff playing a limited role in the explanation. The reduction in the gap between 2019 and 2021 is due to the share of women in more senior grades increasing (while their share in more junior grades decreased) and increases in the share of women working full-time. The pay gap has also reduced within the cohort of workers who work full-time, reducing from 12% to 8%.</p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission has maintained gender pay parity since its formation in 2016.</p></reply>

Section 118(5G) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provides for this scheme. This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee. Under section 118B TCA 1997, an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment. Where a bicycle or safety equipment is purchased under the Cycle-to-Work scheme or through a salary sacrifice arrangement, certain conditions must be met. Further guidance regarding the Cycle-to-Work scheme and salary sacrifice arrangements can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website. The Cycle-to-Work scheme is available to all staff in my Department and is centrally administered for my Department by the National Shared Services Office.</p>  <p>  My Department has a number of facilities to aid staff who actively travel to work. There are dedicated, secure bicycle parking facilities across a number of locations, and a dedicated bicycle repair station is available. My Department also has a dedicated drying room, where staff can dry wet gear. There are shower facilities in all buildings occupied by my Department, which staff can utilise as required, and an increase in the capacity of shower cubicles is currently being assessed. </p>  <p>  The following has been provided by the bodies under the aegis of my Department which have employees regarding the steps they are taking to encourage active travel modes to and from work: </p>  <p>  The Central Bank published a Smarter Travel Action Plan on its intranet site, encouraging a shift to sustainable travel modes such as walking, cycling and public transport. The Bank is also considering a post-pandemic travel survey for all staff. It provides secure bicycle spaces, showers, changing rooms and drying rooms across its city centre campus to support/encourage staff to walk, run and cycle to work. These end of journey facilities, which include a bike maintenance station provide staff with the means to commute to work in a comfortable manner. Similar facilities are provided at the Bank&rsquo;s premises in Sandyford. The Bank&rsquo;s Facilities Management team meets regularly with a staff cycling liaison group to discuss any issues, and ensure provision of safe, secure and efficient facilities. This has been paused during the Pandemic due to the limited numbers cycling into the office. The Bank also advertises the Cycle to Work scheme for staff twice per year. The Tax Saver Public Transport programme for staff is actively promoted in the Central Bank&rsquo;s communication channels and pop-up info stands during the course of the year. In conjunction with other organisations in the area and independently, the Bank has been in regular communication with the National Transport Authority to review transport options in the North Wall Quay (NWQ) district. Within the confines of the NWQ car park, 5 spaces are provided exclusively for the use of multi-occupancy cars and there are three electric car spaces available. With the construction of its new Mayor Street building (adjoining NWQ), facilities supporting active travel will again be to the fore, with a provision of a 200 space bike park and end of journey facilities.</p>  <p>  The Investor Compensation Company shares a premises with the Central Bank and its staff are seconded from the Bank. As such, any facilities provided by the Bank or measures taken by the Bank to encourage active travel, as set out above, also apply to the Investor Compensation Company.</p>  <p>  While the Credit Review Office is a body under the aegis of my Department, its staff are seconded from Enterprise Ireland (EI). EI is a body under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and as such EI is responsible for any measures taken to encourage and facilitate staff in the Credit Review Office to use active travel to commute to work.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has approximately 200 head count staff and four car park spaces but a large number of bicycle locking facilities and therefore the Office can more easily facilitate those who bike to work rather than those who drive. The Office also has changing rooms and showers at its premises, to facilitate those who use active travel to commute to work.</p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council includes information on the Cycle to Work scheme in its employee handbook/HR manual. A large number of employees have availed of this scheme since beginning their employment with the Council. In addition, on site facilities include dedicated secure bicycle parking and shower facilities.</p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman encourages employees to commute to work using active travel by promoting the Cycle to Work scheme and making facilities available for staff who cycle to work. Since the implementation of its Phased Return to Work plan, the FSPO has encouraged active travel, both in the context of overall employee well-being and the potential impact on passenger numbers on public transport. The FSPO communicated the benefits of the Cycle to Work scheme most recently to staff in March 2022, which included useful information on the application process. </p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) are under my Department&rsquo;s remit. The NTMA provides business, facilities and support services to NAMA, HBFI and the SBCI, and operates the Cycle to Work Scheme to encourage employees to use active travel to commute to work. The NTMA&rsquo;s The Treasury Dock building has various facilities to encourage walkers, runners and cyclists such as 346 bicycle spaces, 4 changing rooms which house 30 showers and 324 lockers and 2 drying rooms for wet gear equipment</p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has an active employee well-being framework in place that includes encouragement of employees to remain active to support their well-being. Revenue supports cycling to work via the government Bike to Work Scheme. Some 80% of Revenue staff remain working from home. Those staff who are attending the workplace are advised to avoid the use of public transport and to walk or cycle to work where possible.</p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission has a small number of designated car parking spaces available so the Commission has been actively promoting the Cycle-to-Work scheme for any staff member who resides within a reasonable distance from its workplace. A sufficient number of secure bicycle racks are also available to meet the needs of any staff member who wishes to avail of the scheme. In addition to this, the Commission is also implementing a Pilot Blended Working Scheme which is reducing the need for staff to commute to and from work.</p></reply>

The North Road has new road markings and signage and is operating as a one-way system, in the city direction only.  The North Road one-way system is clearly marked as one way for cars only, with &ldquo;No Entry&rdquo; signage on the North Road at Garda HQ.  In addition, there are two cycle lanes clearly marked on the North Road. The OPW will review all signage, as the No Entry sign visible on the North Road, may need an exception on it for cyclists. Signage has been erected at both entrances to the Upper Glen Road notifying motorists that there is a cul-de-sac and also that this is a &ldquo;no through road&rdquo;.  Specific additional signage has been ordered &lsquo;no motorbikes&rsquo;.  The bollards are delineated the cul-de-sac allow for cyclists, wheelchairs, and people with buggies access. </p>  <p>  The OPW completed the  installation of traffic lane separators along the entire length of Chesterfield Avenue, on both sides of the road, providing a safer environment  for cyclists. All appropriate signage is in place and a review will be undertaken to ensure that there is no misleading way markers. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that 30 kilometre per hour signage is painted on the road at each entrance of the Phoenix Park, with further signage throughout the Park.  All signage is compliant with the Department of Transport regulations.  When exiting the Phoenix Park, the local authority has responsibility over the correct speed limit signage that is appropriate to their roads.

In the Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV) 2022 in December, given the ongoing effects of the pandemic, a number of further targeted supports totalling &euro;96 million were provided to Departments in respect of Covid-19, bringing the funding remaining in the Covid-19 related reserve funds to just over &euro;3.9 billion.</p>  <p>  These allocations comprised &euro;10 million to the Department of Transport for a support scheme for travel agents; &euro;10 million to the Department of Social Protection in respect of the Covid mitigation redundancy and insolvency scheme; &euro;25 million to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media for additional supports to the Live Entertainment sector in response to further Covid related restrictions for that sector and &euro;51 million to Department of Education in relation to Covid-19 measures in term 2 of the 2021/2022 school year. </p>  <p>  The remaining reserve provision includes amounts earmarked for the Departments of Health and Education (&euro;0.2bn) and for labour market impacts as Covid-19 related income and support schemes are unwound (&euro;0.9bn). Given the additional expenditure pressures as a result of the Omicron wave, the Health and Education funding is currently expected to be required in full. Costs incurred on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Covid-19 Illness Benefit to date are currently in excess of the REV provision for these schemes and a further allocation to the Department of Social Protection may be required in respect of these later this year. Further Covid-19 related allocations to Departments may also be needed to meet the cost of the Quarter 1 Commercial Rates Waiver, the health staff recognition payment and for the costs of antiviral drugs.</p>  <p>  These measures, together with the expenditure package agreed to support citizens with energy costs, mean that approximately &euro;1&frac12; billion of this reserve is in effect committed. While there is potential for some of these costs to be met from underspends in other areas, if the full amounts fall to be met from the reserve funds this would leave a remaining balance of some &euro;2&frac12; billion. There may be further Covid-19 related spending requirements during 2022 which would need to be met from this reserve as Covid-19 related employment support schemes are unwound and depending on the position with the virus later in the year. </p></reply>

The draft PEACE PLUS programme was approved by Government as well as by the Northern Ireland Executive and the North South Ministerial Council in the autumn of 2021.</p>  <p>  The draft programme is now in the process of submission to the European Commission for its final review and approval. The approval and adoption process is expected to conclude in summer 2022.  </p>  <p>  In parallel, SEUPB is preparing for the first Calls for Applications, and is already providing pre-application support for potential applicants for some Investment Areas, including  Investment Areas 1.1 (Local Authority Peace Action Plans) and 3.2 (PEACE PLUS Youth Programme). SEUPB is also preparing for the initial Programme Monitoring Committee meeting for PEACE PLUS in summer 2022.  The Programme Monitoring Committee will be asked to approve the first tranche of Calls for Applications documents, as well as other programme rules and processes, to allow for the beginning of programme mobilisation.</p></reply>

Among a broad set of responsibilities across the transport area, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has certain statutory objectives and functions in relation to the promotion of active travel.  In January of this year, the Minister of Transport announced that the NTA had allocated funds to Ireland&rsquo;s local authorities with a view to spending &euro;289 million on walking and cycling infrastructure in 2022.  This funding covers approximately 1,200 Active Travel projects. </p><p><i>Project Ireland 2040</i>sets out the Government&rsquo;s policy on spatial planning and infrastructure development over the period to 2040. Active travel is a feature of the two overarching policy documents &ndash; the <i>National Planning Framework </i>and the ten-year <i>National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030.</i></p><p>My Department is currently liaising with the NTA with a view to signing up to the TFI Smarter Travel programme to promote and encourage sustainable and active commuting.  My Department recognises the environmental, health and well-being, economic and social benefits of active travel.  In this context, staff in my Department have access to the Cycle to Work Scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners.  In operation since 2009, the Cycle to Work Scheme is a tax incentive scheme that allows employers to purchase new bikes and related safety equipment for employees who repay the costs through an agreed schedule of deductions from their gross salary.  The amount of salary sacrificed is exempt from tax, employee&rsquo;s PRSI and income levies. </p><p>My Department also provides secure bike sheds, shower facilities and dry-rooms in a number of our buildings for staff who travel to and from work by bicycle or by other modes of active travel.  In addition, a bicycle repair station for staff use for routine bicycle maintenance is situated at the rear of the Government Buildings campus.  </p><p>More generally, my Department is committed to a culture of staff well-being and this is reinforced by the Department&rsquo;s Health and Well-being Strategy.  It has been well documented that the health and well-being of staff directly affects employee engagement and performance and many of the initiatives under the strategy are focused on encouraging staff to be more active.  My Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;PERsonal Wellbeing Calendar 2022&rdquo; sets out a series of events and conferences designed to promote a healthy lifestyle and to mark various national awareness days.  These include a Step Challenge and events to mark National Walking Day.</p><p>The position in relation to the bodies under the aegis of my Department is set out below.  </p><p><b>Office of Public Works (OPW)</b></p><p>The OPW will continue to encourage staff to use active travel by approving employee applications on the Cycle to Work Scheme.  The OPW provide secure bike sheds and storage facilities, shower and changing facilities and lockers for staff in the main offices who choose active forms of travel. </p><p>The OPW will continue to encourage the use of the Travel Pass for all TaxSaver Travel Pass Tickets which will contribute to active travel. </p><p><b>Public Appointments Service (PAS)</b></p><p>PAS is committed to meeting their responsibilities to ensure that services are delivered through the efficient use of resources with minimal environmental impact.  In collaboration with their Corporate Social Responsibility committee, PAS encourage staff to travel to work using their own energy where possible. In the last five years, 11.5% of the PAS workforce have availed of the cycle to work scheme and the PAS has bike storage on-site where staff can store their bicycles safely.  Staff are not encouraged to drive to work and only a very limited number of parking spaces are available on-site, which are reserved for staff who need them on an exceptional basis, including those who require them as a reasonable accommodation. </p><p>Where staff are not within walking or cycling distance of the office, they are encouraged to use public transport.  Prior to the pandemic, 30% of the workforce availed of the annual travel pass scheme which encourages staff to travel to work using public transport and this is likely to resume from 2022. </p><p>As part of the Staying Well and Connected programme, PAS have run a number of step and fitness challenges which have all encouraged staff to build a walking commute into their daily routine and to walk on local journeys where possible. </p><p><b>National Shared Services Office (NSSO)</b></p><p>The NSSO provides showers and bicycle cages to facilitate and encourage staff to walk, run and cycle to and from work, and for those that wish to exercise during break times.  In addition, NSSO staff have access to the Travel Pass Scheme and Cycle to Work Scheme.  The NSSO also runs a series of health and well-being seminars and talks whose aims included getting people to become and stay active.</p><p><b>Office of the Ombudsman </b></p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman provides showers, lockers and bicycle cages to facilitate and encourage staff to walk, run and cycle to and from work.  Staff were also offered free bicycle servicing on a particular day during the pandemic. The Office has also ran a series of health and well-being seminars and talks whose aims included getting people to become and stay active.</p><p><b>State Laboratory</b></p><p>The staff of the State Laboratory have access to the Travel Pass Scheme and Cycle to Work Scheme. Secure and sheltered bicycle parking is available to staff, as are showers and changing facilities. </p><p><b>Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery Regulator (ORNL)</b></p><p>The ORNL supports staff who wish to cycle to work by facilitating participation in the Cycle to Work Scheme.  The ORNL has secure storage available to staff cycling to work.  Shower facilities are normally available which can be used by staff who want to cycle or run to work, although these facilities are currently unavailable due to refurbishment works.</p></reply>

I understand that the Environmental Health Service undertakes certain functions on behalf of local authorities on an agency basis, but that is a matter between the environmental health service and the local authorities concerned. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 places a general duty of care on the owner or occupier of a premises to ensure that wastewater from the premises does not cause nuisance or risk to human health or the environment.

A water services authority or any person affected by a failure of a third party may complain to the District Court in relation to a breach of the duty of care under section 70 once they have notified the third party in advance of their intention to make such a complaint.  A prescribed form of notice of such complaint is available for general use under S.I. No. 141 of 2009.</p></reply>

In 2021, overall completions of applications had recovered to 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.  Notwithstanding this level of activity, there has been an increase in the length of some completion times and an increase in arrears, due, in the main, to Covid-19 restrictions.  </p>  <p>  In terms of business continuity planning, and in anticipation of accumulating arrears, in 2021, a request for a planned increase in the pay-bill subhead of the PRA&rsquo;s Vote was granted in the Revised Estimates for 2022. As part of its strategic workforce planning, the PRA has been engaging on a continuing basis with the Public Appointments Service to prioritise its requests for the recruitment of staff. </p>  <p>  A new Arrears Clearance Programme has already been set in train by the PRA Management Board, and cross organisational multi-disciplinary teams have been established to focus on the elimination of arrears. This programme, underpinned by project management discipline, envisages a structured approach to implementation, with an emphasis on data analysis, innovation and business process improvement. The PRA intends to communicate this intent, and ongoing progress achieved, to both its internal and external stakeholders. One aim of the programme is to achieve the guaranteed casework turnaround times that existed pre-Covid in the PRA&rsquo;s Customer Charter.</p>  <p>  Finally, the PRA is always willing to act on requests from lodging parties to expedite an application pending in the Land Registry, and every effort is made to expedite cases where valid grounds for urgency exist, such as a pending sale or financial hardship.</p></reply>

Local authority officials and elected members have a very important role to play in this regard by making adequate budgetary provision for housing repairs and cyclical maintenance utilising the significant housing rental income available to them as part of the annual budgetary process.</p><p>Notwithstanding the legal obligations on local authorities to manage and maintain their housing stock, my Department does provide annual funding to local authorities to support their work in this area through the Voids Programme. This funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted to support authority's to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock. </p><p>From 2014 to 2021, expenditure of some &euro;261 million was recouped to local authorities under the Voids Programme which funded the return to productive use of 18,527 properties nationwide. </p><p>There has been extensive funding provided particularly over the last two years under the Voids programme which not only catered for standard re-lets but also for vacant properties requiring more extensive works prior to re-let. It is up to each local authority to submit a programme of works based on their individual allocation or targets.</p><p>Over the period 2018 to 2021, 240 properties were remediated in Wicklow under the Voids Programme funded by my Department. The table below provides the breakdown of the funding allocated and drawn down by Wicklow County Council by year. This figure does not include properties returned to productive use by the local authority using funding from their own resources. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Funding<br /><br />Allocated 2018 </th>       <th>Funding Drawndown<br /><br />2018 </th>       <th>Funding Allocated 2019 </th>       <th>Funding Drawndown<br /><br />2019 </th>       <th>Funding Allocated 2020 </th>       <th>Funding Drawndown<br /><br />2020 </th>       <th>Funding Allocated 2021 </th>       <th>Funding Drawndown<br /><br />2021 </th>       <th>Funding Allocated 2018 -   2021</th>       <th>Funding Drawndown<br /><br />2018 - 2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>&euro;452,145 </td>       <td>&euro;494,600 </td>       <td>&euro;235,309 </td>       <td>&euro;1,310,481 </td>       <td>&euro;1,179,514 </td>       <td>&euro;1,672,000 </td>       <td>&euro;1,411,536 </td>       <td>&euro;3,477,081 </td>       <td>&euro;3,278,504 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In 2018 local authorities were advised of a target number of units under the Voids programme and Wicklow's target that year was 36 units. Funding would be recouped to local authorities on the LAs target number of units provided the costs did not breach the maximum cap of &euro;30,000 and the line item limits set that year, this figure includes Energy Efficiency Works. Wicklow County Council returned 24 units at a total cost of &euro;452,145.</p><p>Full details in relation to output up to and including the 2021 programme is available on the link below.</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/collection/0906a-other-local-authority-housing-scheme-statistics/#voids-programme</p><p>My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in this area this year and allocations for the Voids Programme in 2022 will issue to Wicklow County Council presently. However, as result of the significant investment from my Department in the Voids Programme, local authorities should also now be in a strong position to begin the transition to a strategic and informed planned maintenance approach to stock management and maintenance.</p><p>To that end my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes are aligned with this approach.  </p></reply>

It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022 for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. It is the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p><p>As part of the eligibility criteria applicant(s) of the Local Authority Home Loan must have received insufficient offers of finance from two regulated financial providers to apply for a Local Authority Home Loan. The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers and fresh start applicants to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties or to self-build in a suitable price range.</p><p>To be eligible for a Local Authority Home Loan you must:</p><p>- be a first-time buyer;</p><p>- be aged between 18 and 70 years;</p><p>- be in continuous employment for a minimum of two years, as the primary earner or be in continuous employment for a minimum of one year, as a secondary earner</p><p>- as a single applicant have an annual gross income of not more than &euro;65,000 in counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow and be earning under &euro;50,000 in all other counties; </p><p>- as joint applicants have an annual gross income of not more than &euro;75,000 combined in all counties;</p><p>- not be a current or previous owner of residential property in or outside the Republic of Ireland, unless you are a &ldquo;Fresh Start&rdquo; applicant;</p><p>- purchase or self-build a property situated in the Republic of Ireland;</p><p>- purchase or self-build a property which does not exceed the maximum market value applicable for the county in which it is located.

At the end of February 2022, 50.88% of the workforce was male while 49.12% were female.  It is committed to equal pay and all salaries are equal regardless of gender.  </p><p>Action 8.5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan makes a commitment &ldquo;<i>to improve gender balance at each level by reviewing supports and policies to ensure these are impactful and measurable&rdquo;.  </i>My Department fully supports this commitment.</p><p>My Department has proactively managed its gender balance particularly at senior management level where at Assistant Principal (AP) and Principal Officer (PO) levels there was a relatively low representation of females in the past.  At the most senior level of my Department 50% of Assistant Secretaries and equivalents are female.  However, in January 2021 only 28% of POs and equivalents and 44% of AP and equivalents were female.  Following a concerted focus on encouraging greater numbers of women to apply for senior roles in my Department, these levels have improved over the past year and at the end of February 2022 of 43% of POs and equivalent were female and 46% of AP and equivalents were female.  My Department is very encouraged by this growth in female participation in these two grades and will continue to monitor gender equality across all grades.  </p><p>A gender action plan has been developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department is committed to advancing the actions set down in the plan, and has developed its own departmental action plan.  My Department has also established a senior working group who are looking at ways to improve female participation rate at a senior level.

These efforts were recognised recently when my Department was awarded a Gold Certificate as a cycle-friendly employer under the European Bike2Work project. We are the second Government Department to achieve this certification and it acknowledges my Department&rsquo;s work in improving active travel modes. The cycle-friendly employer certification scheme was developed to establish a European standard for cycle friendly organisations and to increase the number of employees who cycle to work. In addition, my Department is a member of the Smarter Travel Workplaces Partner scheme. This scheme is run by the National Transport Authority (NTA) who support member organisations in encouraging sustainable and active travel. </p><p>Various initiatives have been undertaken by my Department to improve active travel infrastructure across Departmental locations, including; the provision of lockers, secure bicycle storage facilities, changing rooms and shower facilities. Furthermore, my Department encourages staff use of active travel and sustainable transport options through regular internal communications to all staff relating to both the Annual Travel Pass scheme and Cycle to Work scheme and the active monitoring of staff participation in same.</p><p>The information requested in relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for the individual bodies concerned.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-31a.707.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022033100079#WRP01900"><p>The New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement was a significant shared achievement by the parties in Northern Ireland together with the two Governments, and its full implementation and the fulfilment of our own commitments made alongside the agreement, are key priorities for the Irish Government. While the implementation of the NDNA agreement was raised at the BIIGC, due to time constraints, there was not a detailed discussion of both Governments&rsquo; respective commitments. </p>  <p>  I was disappointed to hear the Secretary of State&rsquo;s announcement, on Monday, that he would not bring forward the language legislation before the Assembly election on 5 May. The package of language and identity legislation agreed in New Decade New Approach was detailed and balanced and should be implemented &ndash; as should all the commitments in NDNA. This would have been better done in the Assembly as intended but there is no reason for further delay or deadlock over the positive measures agreed in support of linguistic diversity and cultural expression in Northern Ireland. It should be advanced on the basis of the legislative provisions negotiated, agreed and published at the time of NDNA.</p>  <p>  This Government has made significant progress to fulfilling its commitments agreed to at the time of the NDNA agreement with regards to support for the Irish language in Northern Ireland. This includes the allocation of: &euro;1.2m per annum for 2021-2023 for Irish language broadcasting; &euro;1.2m over three years (2020-22) to support the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and an All Island expansion of the existing Irish Language Network strategy.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the commitments made at the time of the NDNA  agreement, which focussed on working with the Executive through the NSMC to deliver projects that benefit people across the island, including greater connectivity between North and South; investing in the North West region and in border communities; supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and supporting reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process, are reflected in the Programme for Government. They are therefore at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s approach to Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  With regard to the UK&rsquo;s Nationality and Borders Bill, the Government has been engaging with the British Government at both official and political level to make clear our concerns with regard to the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme set out in the Bill, which is currently progressing through the British Parliament. As currently drafted, the Bill would provide that the UK&rsquo;s immigration rules may require that non-Irish and non-British citizens obtain an ETA before travelling to the UK, including for journeys across the land border with Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The implementation of such a scheme would have implications for daily lives and livelihoods on this island, with potential implications for cross-border healthcare, tourism, education, and integrated supply chains. Tens of thousands of people cross the border every day in the course of their daily lives, including to access essential services, for business, and for family reasons. It is a uniquely shared space. This is something which the Irish and British Governments recognised and committed to supporting in Strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement. I raised these concerns with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister of State for Northern Ireland at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Dublin. During our meeting, I expressed the Government&rsquo;s serious concerns with regard to the draft Bill&rsquo;s ETA provisions as they relate to cross border travel.  </p>  <p>  We will continue to engage on the issue and emphasise to the British Government our serious concerns, with a view to finding a satisfactory resolution that addresses them. </p></reply>

Over recent years, my Department has taken a proactive and strategic approach to advancing gender equality and wider diversity and inclusion issues. In 2012, a Management Board Sub-Committee focusing on diversity and inclusion issues, including Gender Equality was established, which brings together key stakeholders across the Department to provide leadership and strategic direction.</p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Strategy 2019-2022, a number of initiatives and policies have been advanced to improve gender, equality, diversity and inclusion. In 2019, a dedicated Lead Officer for Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion was appointed who co-ordinates work in this area across the Department. Through the Human Resources Strategy 2019-2022, as part of a wider Gender Equality Action Plan, my Department has published a Maternity Leave Cover Policy; a Guide to Supports for Maternity, Adoptive and Parental Leave; and is finalising the adoption of a Menopause Policy, which is expected to be launched in Q2 2022. </p>  <p>  Since 2019, my Department has published three reports on the Gender Pay Gap within DFA and in 2021 developed a Gender Pay Gap Action Plan. The Action Plan is structured around four key pillars: Workforce Planning; Support for Female Colleagues; Data Management and Analysis; and Outreach.  Part of the analytics process shows that the Department of Foreign Affairs has reduced its Gender Pay Gap from over 30% in 2013 to 15.17% in 2021 and has made determined efforts to work towards a better gender balance at senior HQ and overseas positions. My Department&rsquo;s current Gender Pay Gap has been determined based on internal calculations. The next Departmental Gender Pay Gap report will be published in line with regulations introduced under the Gender Pay Gap Information Act, 2021.</p>  <p>  More broadly, as part of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the Gender Pay Gap, it led on the establishment of an inter-departmental working group on the Gender Pay Gap, which acts as an informal means of sharing best practices in the area of reducing the Gender Pay Gap and promoting Gender Equality across the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  While my Department has taken positive steps to reduce the Gender Pay Gap, I am conscious that further efforts are required to reduce the gap and I am committed to ensuring that work continues. The Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Division is presently in the final stages of the development of a Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan which aims to further progress in the area of Gender Equality and  also across the spectrum of equality, diversity and inclusion issues.</p>  <p>  There are no public bodies or agencies under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p></reply>

This has predominately been achieved through the promotion of the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cycle to Work&rsquo; Scheme, which is a tax incentive scheme to encourage employees to cycle to work. Under the scheme an employer can pay for a new bicycle (including bicycle accessories) and the employee then repays the cost in regular instalments from their gross salary. Since its inception and up to the end of 2021, 498 Department staff had availed of the scheme. This scheme has been further supported by the Department through additional investment in bike racks, lockers, drying rooms and showering facilities.</p></reply>

Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  The Commission on the Defence Forces was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government and the Government decision in December 2020 which also agreed its terms of reference and membership.  The report was published on the 9th February 2022.  </p>  <p>  The Commission undertook a significant body of work encompassing their wide-ranging terms of reference.  The report contains 69 main recommendations.  The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  </p>  <p>  The Commission's report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces, including to Defence Forces culture, high-level command and control structures, and for the level of Defence provision in Ireland.  Clearly, there are matters that will require careful consideration and in some critical aspects inter-departmental discussion. This includes the level of resourcing that may be allocated to Defence, legislative implications and the governance framework that will be required to underpin any changes the Government approve on foot of the Commission's report. </p>  <p>  I will also be seeking the views of my Department and the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces Representative Associations will be consulted on all matters that fall within the scope of representation, relating to the implementation of any approved plan.   I will also engage with key stakeholders and the Oireachtas, and I welcome the D&aacute;il statements on the report which took place on the 16th February.  I firmly believe that this is an opportunity to have a mature debate around the type of defence provision that we require and I am very much open to such a discussion.  Current events are highlighting the importance of such a debate.</p>  <p>  The intent is that following relevant consideration, and before the summer recess, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculative discussion on this matter prior to completion of the ongoing process, Government approval of any proposed plan of action, and completion of any subsequent reviews that may ensue.</p></reply>

The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.</p>  <p>  The programme&rsquo;s aims were to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they could move on to their planned educational placement for the start of the next school year along with their peers.</p>  <p>  For the first time ever, all schools (primary and-post primary) were encouraged to provide summer programmes and the eligibility criteria was extended to include post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. Prior to this expansion, summer programmes were only available to special schools and pupils in special classes in primary schools and in DEIS schools.   Overall, 37,977 pupils participated in the 2021 summer programme across both home and school-based elements, which represented an increase of 65% on participation in the 2020 programme.</p>  <p>  The aim for 2022 is to make the programmes as accessible as possible, particularly to continue to attract more schools to run the school-based programme, but also to make the overall experience simpler for parents, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  In this regard, planning for the 2022 Summer Programme is ongoing. As part of that process my Department is currently holding consultation meetings with the education partners.  Details of the programme will be finalised as soon as possible after these meetings have concluded and will be communicated to all schools, as well as published on www.gov.ie </p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school.  It should be noted that not every student with a special educational need requires SNA support. </p>  <p>  In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools was  deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p>  <p>  In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year were announced: </p>  <p>  - Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 were maintained and automatically rolled over into the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  - No school received an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p>  <p>  - SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the 2021/22 school year in the normal way.</p>  <p>  - Priority consideration was given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the  2021/22 school year. In particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools were prioritised with determinations made before 30 June. Other applications were processed in order of date received.</p>  <p>  - As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website, ncse.ie/for-schools.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  </p>  <p>  The Department additionally consults with school patron bodies in order to identify areas with pressures on enrolments. </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the  capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage as well as language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English, of new schools. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area (including Irish-medium provision), are key to the decision-making process and to whether at post-primary level a school would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelchol&aacute;iste or whether, if English-medium, the school would include an Irish-medium unit or &ldquo;Aonad&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Most new post-primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of 600 &ndash; 1,000 students.  A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, having regard to the alternative of establishing an Aonad within a school. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Dublin Rathdown area referred to by the Deputy, in 2014 a new Gaelchol&aacute;iste - Gaelchol&aacute;iste an Phiarsaigh was established in the Ballinteer/Stepaside area (along with Col&aacute;iste Ghl&oacute;r na Mara, Balbriggan, North Dublin). The year of establishment, patronage model and language of instruction have yet to be determined for the new post-primary schools announced to serve the following school planning areas in the general South Dublin area: Dublin 2_Dublin 4 and Sallynoggin_Killiney_DLR/Cherrywood. </p>  <p>  While it is expected that the existing Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; in the general South Dublin area between them have sufficient school places to accommodate the level of demand identified as part of the recent patronage processes in the short term, given the number of new gaelscoileanna which have opened in recent years or are planned to open in this area, my Department is keeping the position under active review as these schools grow and the number of sixth class pupils in gaelscoileanna increases.</p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments through my Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents, which set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency. The Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website, www.energyineducation.ie, which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p><p>Schools designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.</p><p>These new schools include: </p><p>- A3 BER standard </p><p>- Fully evaluated natural ventilation strategy to all spaces</p><p>- 20% higher energy performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the 2019 Building Regulations even thought it was designed pre-2019</p><p>- 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics</p><p>- Provision to enable Energy Supply Companies (ESCO's) to sell renewable biomass heat to the school under the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH), as the heat as a service area matures in Ireland. SSRH is a government funded initiative designed to increase the energy generated from renewable sources in the heat sector.</p><p>- A system that automatically shuts down power to nonessential electrical power outlets when the school is closed (eliminating energy use out of hours) </p><p>- Infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging </p><p>- Rainwater harvesting</p><p>- CO<sub>2</sub>monitors </p><p>- Excellent daylight </p><p>- Internal and external LED lighting</p><p>- Variable speed pumping</p><p>- Building Management System control of energy including energy metering</p><p>- Zone and individual room heating control</p><p>- Educational signage draws attention to environmental aspects of design</p><p>- Support will be offered to the school in terms of understanding energy usage and optimising controls.</p><p>The A3 BER in schools is achieved using a hybrid approach of: </p><p>- Maximising nature through passive solar design, quality daylighting and quality ventilation.</p><p>- Enhanced technologies including LED lighting and controls with daylight and absence detection, digital individual room heating controls, maximum water efficiency and rainwater harvesting systems, high quality air tightness and photovoltaic panels to produce an electrical renewable energy.</p><p>- Schools have a system that automatically shuts down power to nonessential electrical power outlets when a school is closed (eliminating energy use out of hours).</p><p>In the interest of sustainability, the potential of renewables is maximised in school design, whilst ensuring that renewable applications are properly suited to needs and reflective of school opening hours and school holiday periods. It is also critical that an energy reduction plan is part of any investment in renewable energy applications.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s approach is also based on future proofing to ensure school buildings are renewable compatible and are able to take advantage of developing technologies as they become viable, thus enabling a just transition for school management, teachers, pupils and parents to include: </p><p>- Direct modulating high efficiency gas boiler systems that can support the integration of heat pump systems, in series at a base level, with controls.</p><p>- Optimum envelope fabric that will not require additional enhancement for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems, (note further enhancement of the external building fabric will result in overheating in Spring and Autumn, requiring air conditioning). </p><p>- Low water content radiators and operating temperatures for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems. </p><p>- Provision to enable Energy Supply Companies (ESCO's) to sell renewable heat to schools using biomass boilers, with provision for the ESCO to provide, operate and maintain the boiler plant system and maximise the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.</p><p>The Department have been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools over the past twenty plus years. Nearly 60 % of the research programme features renewable aspects. These renewables include wind generation, solar hot water heating, photovoltaics, rain water recovery, geothermal heat pumps, air source heat pumps and biomass heating systems. Results have varied with respect to their applicability in a school environment.  Research continues in many areas. </p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. </p><p>The Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are involved in an energy efficient retrofit pathfinder scheme for schools since 2017. The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. A deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.</p><p>The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-31a.753.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022033100080#WRQ03100"><p>In 1995, the full rate of PRSI (Class A1) was extended to all new employees of those categories of public sector employees who previously paid the modified D1 Class.  It was also applied to those returning to the sector following a break in employment. </p>  <p>  Those paying Class A1 have their pension benefits integrated with their Social Welfare entitlements.  Co-ordination is a common feature of pension schemes and is provided for in the rules of the pension scheme which in general are set out in statute.  Where employees pay full rate PRSI (Class A1), a reduced pension contribution is paid and the amount of occupational pension is reduced accordingly on the basis that the reduction is balanced out by the Old Age Contributory Pension from the Department of Social Protection</p>  <p>  A supplementary pension is an additional amount of pension that may be payable to a retiree whose occupational pension is co-ordinated with the Old Age Contributory Pension.  It is payable to retirees in accordance with the terms of the teachers&rsquo; pension schemes.  Supplementary Pension is equal to the difference between the full occupational pension (that is, the pension which would be payable if co-ordination had not applied), and the combined total of:  (i) the actual occupational pension payable and (ii) the personal rate of Social Welfare benefits payable.</p>  <p>  In other words, it is paid in circumstances where the combined pensions (i.e. occupational and Social Welfare benefit) are less than the pension the person would receive if the occupational pension was calculated on a non-co-ordinated basis.  </p>  <p>  It may also be payable when a teacher who is unemployed, following retirement and who through no fault of their own fails to qualify for any Social Welfare entitlement; it represents the difference between the total of the pensions actually received by the person and the pension that would be payable if the occupational pension was not co-ordinated with the Old Age Pension.  As the state pension may become payable at 66 years and teachers can retire significantly earlier than this, these teachers can apply for the supplementary pension to be paid in the period between retiring and becoming eligible for the state pension.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.

This support was vitally important to ensure that our schools remained open for pupils.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that a framework for adapted School Placement arrangements was developed by the Department of Education and the Teaching Council, together with the relevant Initial Teacher Education (ITE) providers, in order to ensure that student teachers at primary level could continue to support schools during periods of planned school placement from the beginning of January up to the February mid-term break. During this period, student teachers continued to be located in their host school for school placement, but were also available to support other schools where required.</p>  <p>  The Education Stakeholders, including the Department of Education, HEIs providing initial teacher education (ITE) and the Teaching Council, have continued to work together to maintain the integrity of the students&rsquo; ITE experiences and support students in satisfactorily completing their ITE programmes.</p>  <p>  The adapted School Placement arrangements were an exceptional measure introduced as part of a suite of measures to support schools to minimise the risk associated with COVID-19 and in light of the prevalence of the Omicron variant, with the understanding that these would be unwound as soon as possible. The Department understands that student teachers will now return to experiencing the more typical School Placement arrangements, and associated assessments, which are a critical part of their ITE programmes.</p>  <p>  While the adapted School Placement arrangements are no longer in place, student teachers will, if they wish, still be able to support schools by providing substitution cover when they have availability outside of their ITE programme requirements.</p>  <p>  Due to the exigencies of the public health pandemic still posed by the spread of Covid-19,  I have signed into force legislation which permits payment for periods of more than five consecutive school days to 3rd and 4th year student teachers, who satisfy the criteria to be eligible to apply to the Teaching Council for registration, pursuant to Route 5 of the Schedule to the Teaching Council (Registration) Regulations 2016.</p>  <p>  This is a temporary and time limited amendment to Regulation 7 of the Education Act 1998 (Unregistered Persons) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 32 of 2014) which will expire on 30th June 2022.  This amendment solely relates to this category of unregistered persons and the &ldquo;5-day rule&rdquo; remains in place in relation to the employment of all other unregistered persons in schools.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Teaching Council is working to put processes and procedures in place to support the registration and vetting of 3rd and 4th year student teachers.  This is expected to be in place before the end of this academic year.</p></reply>

Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: ncse.ie/regional-services-contact-list.</p><p>I should clarify, however, that the NCSE does not maintain waiting lists for schools.  Boards of management of individual schools are responsible for such enrolment matters.</p><p>As the Deputy's queries refer to individual schools, I will arrange to have them referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school.  It should be noted that not every student with a special educational need requires SNA support. </p>  <p>  Where a school considers that it requires additional SNA support to meet the needs of its students, it can seek a review from the NCSE.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Safe Routes to School is an initiative of the Department of Transport and supported by the Department of Education. It is operated by the An Taisce Green-Schools Programme in partnership with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and the local authorities.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.</p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school. </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.

Payment for any such work is subject to normal PAYE/PRSI conditions.  Where a participant is taking up paid employment, they should check with my department if there are any implications in relation to receipt of DSP payments or secondary benefits. </p>  <p>  A sponsor organisation may, at their own expense, employ a participant under a separate contract of employment for additional hours outside of the participant&rsquo;s normal CE hours, on the condition that the participant is not employed for more than an additional 234 hours in any given 12 months employment contract. The sponsor organisation must declare all such hours to the department on a monthly basis. </p>  <p>  The Department keeps all aspects of its employment and activation programmes under review to ensure that they have the best outcomes for participants.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.</p>  <p>   I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The aim of the CE Childcare Training and Development Programme is to provide CE participants interested in pursuing a career in childcare with training and qualifications in the childcare sector, quality experience, and a clear career path.</p>  <p>  Under the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2021, all staff working directly with children in a pre-school service must hold at least a Level 5 major award in childcare on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), or equivalent as deemed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. The purpose of the Level 5 award is to enable the learner to acquire the skill, understanding and competence to work independently and under supervision in a range of childcare settings and or to progress to higher education and training. By the end of the course learners will be able to understand a range of theoretical concepts relating to child development and education and demonstrate many of the skills required to provide for the holistic needs of babies and young children in a childcare setting.</p>  <p>  There is a requirement for the participant to demonstrate a commitment to engage in sector specific certified training during their time on CE, leading to the achievement of a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) Major Award at Level 5. The CE Childcare Training and Development Programme has three phases and is a three-year programme. </p>  <p>  There are no changes foreseen in the operation of this programme. All CE schemes have standard terms and conditions for participants,  including hours worked and payment rates. </p>  <p>  My  Department keeps all aspects of its employment and activation programmes under review to ensure that they have the best outcomes for participants.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  The Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference were very demanding, and every effort was made to make sure that they were met. The Commission established a Technical Sub-Committee to examine financial, actuarial and demographic information.  The Sub-Committee prepared four Working Papers which covered Population and Labour Force Projections; Expenditure Projections; Poverty Prevention and State Pensions; and Benchmarking and Indexation.  </p><p>The Commission carefully considered the scale of the fiscal sustainability challenge facing the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, based on analysis from a range of sources, including the Department of Finance and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, demographic projections from the Central Statistics Office, and material from the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation process.  KPMG updated the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund (published in 2017) in order to have up-to-date projections of shortfalls in the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>The forecast deficit in the Social Insurance fund used by the Commission is set out in the table below for the years to 2030 -  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Deficit (&euro;Bn) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 </td>       <td>0.30 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2023 </td>       <td>0.51 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2024 </td>       <td>0.71 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2025 </td>       <td>0.91 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2026 </td>       <td>1.22 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2027 </td>       <td>1.62 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2028 </td>       <td>1.72 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2029 </td>       <td>2.03 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2030 </td>       <td>2.36 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As part of updating the work on the Actuarial Review of the SIF, KPMG updated macro-economic parameters to reflect the long-term projections run by the European Commission and sent to Member States, including Ireland, to form the basis of the 2021 Ageing Report.</p><p>The economic growth rates used for the period 2023 to 2040 (i.e. the assumption percentages) are set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Years </th>       <th>Real GDP Growth </th>       <th>Price Inflation </th>       <th>Real Earnings Growth </th>       <th>Unemployment Rate </th>       <th>Employment Growth </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022-2025 </td>       <td>3.6 </td>       <td>1.7 </td>       <td>1.7 </td>       <td>6.1 </td>       <td>1.3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2026-2030 </td>       <td>1.7 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1.3 </td>       <td>6.6 </td>       <td>0.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2031-2035 </td>       <td>1.8 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1.2 </td>       <td>6.8 </td>       <td>0.6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2036-2040 </td>       <td>1.8 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1.5 </td>       <td>6.7 </td>       <td>0.2 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The revenue projections used in the Report of the Commission on Pensions in relation to Class S and Class A PRSI are set out in the table below for the years 2023 to 2040.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  To receive the Fuel Allowance payment an applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and the household composition test. This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and those who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own. </p>  <p>  Contributory pensions such as the State Contributory Pension and Invalidity Pension are qualifying payments for Fuel Allowance and a husband and wife who are both in receipt of the payment may qualify for Fuel Allowance, subject to satisfying all other relevant qualifying conditions. However, it needs to be reiterated that only one allowance is payable per household.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These reforms are on foot of a report from  an Expert Group established in 2019, which comprised national and international experts, and was independently chaired by Michael Scanlan. Its report, Partnership for the Public Good, proposes a new approach to State funding of the sector in future. Its recommendations include a new additional funding stream for the sector, Core Funding, to support quality of provision, improved pay and conditions for staff, management of parental fees and sustainability of services </p>  <p>  Under the new funding stream, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures which includes staff costs. Core Funding will also contribute to cost increases related to non-staff costs (for example, utilities, rent).</p>  <p>  Core Funding is equivalent to an increase of at least 14% on the standard capitation for ECCE. At a minimum, for every ECCE child &euro;78.75 per week will be available from ECCE and Core Funding, compared to &euro;69 in ECCE standard capitation only. Because Core Funding is paid in respect of places rather than children, effectively this could mean a greater &lsquo;per child&rsquo; marginal increase if the service has unfilled capacity. For example, with an ECCE occupancy of 9 children per staff member, Core Funding and ECCE together will be equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.</p>  <p>  Core Funding replaces the ECCE Higher Capitation payment which pays a higher capitation rate of &euro;80.25 for all children attending ECCE classes with a graduate ECCE room lead.  Core Funding includes a new a graduate premium which will be to be paid to services with graduate room leads for all  early learning and care age groups.   </p>  <p>  Core funding is largely contingent on an employment regulation order, ERO, being agreed by the joint labour committee, JLC, for the sector. If agreed, an ERO will establish minimum rates of pay and conditions for all workers and it is a matter for the JLC to determine whether different rates should apply for different roles and qualification levels of staff. A JLC was established this year and has been meeting regularly in recent months.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department will shortly appoint a consultant to undertake a 12 month review of ECCE which will consider any enhancements that can be made based on international evidence and experience to date. The review will involve a wide consultation with providers, educators, parents, children and other stakeholder.</p></reply>

The brief for the Review included:</p><p>- analysing the current costs of providing childcare and the factors that impact on these costs;</p><p>- the development and delivery of a model of the unit costs of providing childcare that allows analysis of policy changes and variation in cost-drivers, including the potential impact of professionalisation; and</p><p>- providing an objective, high-level market analysis of the childcare sector in Ireland, including analysis of fee levels charged to parents.</p><p>The project has provided a robust evidence base for the development of policy and implementation of initiatives to support the delivery of high quality ELC and SAC in Ireland.</p><p>The final report, <i>Independent Review of the Cost of Providing Quality Childcare Services in Ireland</i>, was published on 19 October 2020.</p><p>The report found that average unit cost per hour in the cost modelling tool is 63 cent higher for providers operating in urban settings versus those in rural areas. The urban/rural split is based on the CSO classification of services. The average unit cost in urban settings is &euro;4.37 as opposed to an average unit cost of &euro;3.74 in rural settings. While this shows there is a difference in cost for those operating in urban and rural settings, it does not take into account the variation in cost within these settings.</p><p>Data on provider income and cost was also collected in 2021 by Pobal to enable similar analysis.  A further round of data collection on income and cost drivers will take place in April 2022 to gather to most recent information. </p><p>Information on fees charged is collected as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile, administered by Pobal. The Deputy is correct in saying that fees vary across the country. According to the 2019/20 Sector Profile, average fees are higher in services located in urban areas &ndash; 13% higher for full day care, 12% higher for part-time provision and almost 7% higher for sessional care. It is worth noting that the use of averages can mask significant variation in fees between providers.</p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I was pleased to announced Core Funding, a new supply-side funding stream available to Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) providers from September.  It is informed by recommendations of an Expert Group to design a new funding model for the sector that were adopted by Government in December.</p><p>The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations of the Expert Group, as approved by Government. Fee management will start with a requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access the new Core Funding scheme. Further information on proposed fee management mechanisms in the longer term is available in the Group's report, available at:<i>first5fundingmodel.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level. </p><p>- An income-related subsidy is payable for children from 24 weeks to 15 years of age who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider.  The level of subsidy is determined by the family&rsquo;s assessable income (i.e. gross income minus tax, PRSI and other deductibles and minus any applicable multiple child discount).  </p><p>In addition to the income related subsidy and the universal subsidy the NCS makes provision for vulnerable children under section 14 of the Childcare Support Act  2018.

Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), NCS, AIM and CCSP, and will replace ECCE higher capitation and incorporate funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022.</p>  <p>  The change in approach to funding may mean that a very small number of providers (estimated to be approximately 50 in total or 1% of providers) would receive somewhat less in Core Funding to what they had previously received in Higher Capitation payments and Programme Support Payments (PSP) combined. This affects a small number of services who have particularly benefited from the previous approach to higher capitation by having large ECCE groups with high occupancy, with funding rates ranging between &euro;110 and &euro;120 per operating hour. </p>  <p>  For this small number of providers, I have issued a funding guarantee whereby, under Core Funding providers will receive the same level of funding as they received from higher capitation and PSP, assuming the numbers of children, graduate staff and type of service offered remains the same in the 2022/23 programme year as in 2021/22.</p>  <p>  The September-December 2022 allocation for Core Funding equates to &euro;221 million in full year costs. While funding allocations to Departments are voted on an annual basis by the Oireachtas, an allocation for Core Funding is now established as part of the DCEDIY base budget.  This puts in place a strong foundation for further developments in future years. </p>  <p>  The level of investment being made available for Core Funding is an acknowledgement that high quality ELC and SAC costs more than the current income to the sector. Core Funding allows providers&rsquo; costs to increase to improve quality while ensuring these costs are not passed onto parents in fees and that services are not made unsustainable.</p>  <p>  This is a major step forward in the approach to funding the sector and establishing a new relationship between the State and providers to deliver the public good.  The significant additional investment reflects Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the First 5 target of investment of at least &euro;1 billion by 2028. Core Funding introduces a strategic way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model. It is therefore anticipated that, Core Funding will continue to be made available into 2023 and beyond.</p></reply>

The Ready Reckoner is accessible to all and is designed to give an idea of what services can expect to receive based on their characteristics. It also allows different scenarios of provision to be tested. This will show the benefits of applying for Core Funding when it is possible to do so. </p><p>The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity, and will be available to all services who sign up the scheme, regardless of the qualification levels of staff.  Capacity relates to the number of hours of operation of the service and the age group for whom the service is provided as these are key determinants of the service's operating costs.</p><p>Core Funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain staff; establish career structures; introduce or improve other features of provision that are demonstrated to contribute to quality (e.g. non-contact time, planning, training, curriculum implementation). Staff costs comprise approximately 70% of services' operating costs. &euro;138 million has been allocated as part of the Core Funding package to contribute to staff costs.  This is in addition to existing income from other funding schemes and parents' fees.</p><p>The precise implications of the funding for staff pay and conditions depends on the agreement of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) by the Joint Labour Committee (JLC). However, the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay for the sector as a whole as well as the development of career frameworks. Improved terms and conditions,  opportunities for progression and greater rates of staff retention are important steps to improving quality in the sector.and the development of career frameworks.</p><p>Core Funding will also make a contribution to non-staff overheads (for example, utilities, rent). In a full year, there is an allocation of &euro;20 million for a contribution to non-staff overhead costs through Core Funding. This is the first time this type of funding has been provided.</p><p>Extra funding to support administration costs is also contained within Core Funding. This means that the budget previously allocated to Programme Support Payments (PSP), with an increased allocation, is now incorporated into Core Funding. Core Funding will make &euro;25 million available to providers to support the costs of administrative time.</p><p>The remaining &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support the employment of graduates with a relevant degree at level 7 or above and three years of experience in two types of leadership roles - as Lead Educators across ELC and as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. This aspect of Core Funding will encourage employment of graduates as Lead Educators across all ELC, not just in ECCE rooms as was the case with higher capitation payments.</p><p><i>First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families</i>and Core Funding recognise that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality ELC. Strong international evidence shows that children achieve better outcomes when staff are well qualified. First 5 seeks to continue to build an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce, and includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028.</p><p>In December last year, I launched <i>Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028</i>. <i>Nurturing Skills </i>aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in ELC and SAC. </p><p>In particular, <i>Nurturing Skills </i>commits to the provision of funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 for current early years educators. This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications. The new funding scheme will also develop and introduce mechanisms for providing financial support to ELC services to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave. Plans for the new funding scheme are currently being developed.</p><p>This planned new funding for educators to upskill is in addition to financial supports that are already in place for educators undertaking qualifications. Existing financial supports include the Free Fees Initiative. My Department has since 2014 provided a number of rounds of funding for early years educators to undertake qualifications through the Learner Fund.</p></reply>

An Expert Group was convened to provide recommendations for this model, and their report, Partnership for the Public Good: a New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare was published in December 2021. Their recommendations were accepted in full by Government.</p><p>Core Funding was identified in this report as a key element of the new funding model, which consists of four elements: 1 &ndash; Core Funding. 2 &ndash; Tackling Disadvantage funding (to be developed after Core Funding is implemented). 3 &ndash; National Childcare Scheme (NCS) with some developments. 4 &ndash; the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme with some amendments.</p><p>Core Funding is a payment to providers designed to support quality, sustainability, and enhanced public management, with associated conditions in relation to fee control and cost transparency, incorporating funding for administration and to support the employment of graduate staff. Core Funding aims to offer better financial sustainability to providers in return for a cultural shift to a partnership relationship between providers and the State that reflects the public good dimension of ELC and SAC.</p><p>For the purposes of allocating a Graduate Manager Premium, Core Funding follows the definition of &lsquo;manager&rsquo; as set out in <i>Nurturing Skills &ndash; The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028</i>: &ldquo;The term Manager is used in the Workforce Plan to refer to the person in charge of a setting, as defined in the Early Years Regulations 2016 and SAC Regulations 2018, i.e. &lsquo;the person who has day-to-day charge of the service&rsquo;. While ELC and SAC services vary considerably in their legal and organisational structures, every service must &ndash; as a condition of its registration &ndash; have a designated person in charge (here termed the &lsquo;Manager&rsquo;) who is responsible for the daily running of the service and &ndash; unless deputised by a named person &ndash; must be on the premises at all times when the service is being carried on.&rdquo;</p><p>With this in mind, an ELC Graduate Manager Premium will be applied for the duration of time a Manager is present on the premises. While more than one person may fill the role of Manager, due to the facilities operating in excess of the working hours of a manager, the amount of hours eligible for the Graduate Manager Premium cannot exceed the hours assigned to the Designated Person in Charge of the setting as defined in the Early Years Regulations 2016 and School Age Childcare Regulations 2018. </p><p>For example, if a childcare service operates for 60 hours a week and the Designated Person in Charge works for 40 hours a week, they may also have a deputised named person who covers the remaining 20 hours. However, only the hours worked by the Designated Person in Charge (the manger for the purposes of Core Funding) are counted towards calculating the Graduate Manager Premium &ndash; assuming the person in question is an ELC graduate with the necessary experience.</p><p>Core Funding allocations are not calculated on the basis of staff pay, including sick pay and annual leave. Core Funding is calculated on the basis of capacity; that is, the number of places that can be offered to children of different ages and the amount of time (in terms of hours per day and weeks per year) that they are offered. More capacity results in a higher cost base, especially staff costs, which is why more funding is allocated to services offering a greater level of capacity. Contributing to improved terms and conditions is one of the central aims the funding allocation is intended to achieve. </p><p>Concerning ELC Graduates leading an SAC session, only ELC sessions can have a Graduate Lead Educator Premium when led by an ELC Graduate as there currently is no list of approved qualifications for School Age Childcare services.</p><p>Further information will continue to be available here and support, guidance and training will continue to be available through the City and County Childcare Committees.</p></reply>

This will show the benefits of applying for Core Funding when it is possible to do so. </p><p>The equivalent full year costs of the budget allocation for Core Funding is &euro;221m.  Of this, &euro;25 million is for a contribution to administrative costs and &euro;20 million is allocated to contribute to non staff costs.  A further &euro;138 million is intended to contribute to staff costs and &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support the employment of graduates in leadership roles. </p><p>Core Funding for programme year 2022-2023 will support providers in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase. </p><p>The amount payable under Core Funding will be determined primarily based on services' capacity: hours of operation, age group of children services are provided for and number of child places.  These are the primary drivers of services' operating costs.  Core Funding will be paid in equal monthly instalments over the Core Funding Programme Year. </p><p>In order to determine an accurate allocation, the provider will be required to complete a three stage application process. Stage 1 of the application process opens in April. Service providers will be required to fill out the Sector Profile and Income &amp;amp; Costs Survey, which is a prerequisite for application for Core Funding. Stage 2 of the application process will open in June. Providers will define their service&rsquo;s profile and their capacity in detail in an online form. Stage 3 of the application process will open in August, when individual contracts will be made available to applicants for signature.</p><p>Once payments commence for programme year 2022-2023, the provider will be required to confirm or update their service profile throughout the year to reflect any changes to their capacity. </p><p>Participants in Core Funding will also be required to share information on the profile of their service, income and costs, quality measures and other data collection exercises. </p><p>The &euro;25 million to contribute to administrative costs that is part of Core Funding incorporates the funding previously allocated to Programme Support Payment (PSP) from the 2022-2023 programme year.

The evidence suggests children achieve better outcomes when staff are well qualified. This is undisputed internationally. First 5 seeks to continue to build an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce, and includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I announced the introduction of a new Core Funding stream from September 2022. Core Funding has a number of objectives, including to support improved quality, affordability, sustainability and the achievement of the commitment to a graduate-led workforce. Of the total of &euro;221m in full year costs, &euro;38m is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and school-age childcare (SAC) services. This aspect of Core Funding will encourage employment of graduates as Lead Educators across all ELC.</p>  <p>  The requirement in Core Funding that a person will have to have 3 years&rsquo; experience in the sector in order for the service to be allocated a Graduate Premium is unchanged from the rule that currently governs the payment of Higher Capitation rates in the ECCE programme. This rule has been in place since the ECCE programme was first introduced in 2010. Under Core Funding, the availability of a graduate premium is extended beyond the ECCE programme to all funded provision of ELC.</p>  <p>  As with the current requirements for Higher Capitation payments in the ECCE programme, the 3 years&rsquo; experience requirement for the Graduate Premium in Core Funding can be met through any paid experience working in either ELC or SAC, including part-time work, and the paid experience can be gained at any time, including before an individual undertook their degree qualification.</p>  <p>  The Graduate Premium is specifically for those who are in positions of leadership, either as Manager of a service or as lead educator with a group of children, which may also include leadership or supervision of other staff in the room. It is expected to support the commitments to the strengthening of career pathways for those working in the sector set out in Nurturing Skills, the Workforce Plan for ELC and SAC 2022-2028, which I launched last December.</p>  <p>  Supported by the Higher Capitation payments in the ECCE programme, the proportion of staff in ELC services with a relevant degree has risen from 12% in 2012 to 34% in 2021, as reported in Nurturing Skills.</p>  <p>  Nurturing Skills makes a number of commitments to support the move to a graduate-led workforce, including the commitment to remove the exclusive link between higher capitation payments and the ECCE programme through Core Funding. Alongside monitoring implementation of all aspects of Nurturing Skills, I will continue to keep the requirement for 3 years' experience in the Graduate Premium for Core Funding under review over the coming years.</p></reply>

The Ready Reckoner is accessible to all and is designed to give an idea of what services can expect to receive based on their characteristics. It also allows different scenarios of provision to be tested. This will show the benefits of applying for Core Funding when it is possible to do so. </p><p>Of the total of &euro;221m in full year costs, &euro;138 million is intended to contribute to staff costs, &euro;25 million is for a contribution to administrative costs and &euro;20 million is allocated to contribute to non staff costs. &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The graduate premium aspect of Core Funding will encourage employment of graduates as Lead Educators across all ELC, not just in ECCE rooms as was the case with higher capitation payments.</p><p>Core Funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain staff, including degree qualified staff; establish career structures; introduce or improve other features of provision that are demonstrated to contribute to quality (e.g. non-contact time, planning, training, curriculum implementation). Staff costs comprise approximately 70% of a service's operating costs. Core Funding makes available &euro;138 million of new funding available to contribute to staff costs, which will be in addition to the existing income available to providers through the public funding through ECCE and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and parents' fees.</p><p>The precise implications of the funding for staff pay and conditions depends on the agreement of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) by the Joint Labour Committee (JLC). However, the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay for the sector as a whole as well as the development of career frameworks. Improved terms and conditions,  opportunities for progression and greater rates of staff retention are important steps to improving quality in the sector.</p><p>Core Funding will also make a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (for example, utilities, rent) that make up the remaining 30% of providers costs. In a full year, there is an allocation of &euro;20 million for a contribution to non-staff overhead costs through Core Funding. This is the first time this type of funding has been provided.  </p><p>Extra funding to support administration costs is also contained within Core Funding. This means that the budget previously allocated to Programme Support Payments, with an increased allocation, is now incorporated into Core Funding. Core Funding will make &euro;25 million available to providers to support the costs of administrative time.</p><p>The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity - opening hours, opening weeks and the age group of children for whom services are provided.  The rationale for this is that these are the primary characteristics that determine the service's costs of delivery. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity will support sustainability and stability for services, since they will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance. </p><p>Core Funding will address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022.</p><p>The significant majority of ELC and SAC services will see substantial increases in income through Core Funding. It is important to state that no service will lose out because of Core Funding.</p><p>My Department has issued a funding guarantee to providers. All services will receive at least the same level of funding in Core Funding as they received from higher capitation and PSP in the 2021/22 programme year, assuming the numbers of children, graduate staff and type of service offered remains the same</p><p>Services for whom the Funding Guarantee will apply and those who will see just small increases from Core Funding are ECCE services in receipt of higher capitation for large groups of children and with high occupancy levels. Such services are currently in receipt of the highest levels of public funding relative to the staffing levels required for operating those types of services, &euro;110-&euro;120 per hour of service provided.</p><p>Due to the nature of ECCE provision &ndash; 15 hours per week for 38 weeks per year &ndash; even a small Core Funding allocation can take account of increased delivery costs including staffing costs.</p><p>The level of investment being made available for Core Funding is an acknowledgement that high quality ELC and SAC costs more than the current income to the sector and that this additional investment is best allocated by linking the quantum of funding to services with their underlying costs of delivery. </p><p>This is the start of a multi-annual investment plan and is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the First 5 target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028. Core Funding introduces a strategic way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model.</p></reply>

Services were required to provide Fire Safety Certificates as part of the re-registration process.  Many services have already re-registered and submitted a Fire Safety Certificate and some have re-registered subject to submitting an up-to-date Fire Safety Certificate.</p>  <p>   In August 2019, Tusla issued guidance for registered providers of early years services on the fire and planning requirements for the re-registration process. It is important to note that these were not new regulations, but guidance on the submission of documentation for the purpose of re-registration. Registration of early years services is granted only where Tusla is satisfied that the premises, operation and location of the service pose no unmanaged risk to children. All registered services are expected to have the appropriate fire certification in place. </p>  <p>  In an effort to assist providers in meeting the re-registration deadline, Tusla divided the process into two parts. The first part, including submission of an application form and critical supporting documentation, was completed at the end of 2019 and the deadline for the second part (submission of remaining documents) was postponed until June 2020. Due to the unprecedented situation with Covid&ndash;19, a decision was taken to further defer the deadline for submission of remaining supporting documentation to 1 November 2021. This deadline has now passed and all services should have submitted the outstanding documentation to the Tusla Registrations Office.  </p>  <p>  The suitability and safety of premises is a key concern in the assessment of quality provision for children in early years services. Section 58G of the Child Care Act, 1991 (as amended by Part 12 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013) places an onus on the providers of early years services to ensure that they take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of children. Under the Building Control legislation, the majority of early years settings fall into the category of purpose group that requires providers to ensure that the early years setting complies with specific provisions under fire building design and compliance regulations. Requirements of detection, containment and safe evacuation of children and staff in the event of fire must be considered. The statutory authority for the interpretation and determination of fire certification requirements for new or existing early years services is the local authority fire service department.</p>  <p>  Tusla is the independent statutory regulator of early learning and care and school-age childcare services in Ireland. As Tusla is independent in its statutory functions, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth may not intervene in relation to particular cases. </p>  <p>  Given the absolute priority to keep children safe in these services, I allocated funding under my Department's Annual Capital Programme in 2021 to assist services complete any outstanding fire safety works required to obtain a Fire Safety Certificate. A total of &euro;5 million was allocated across 643 services to carry out remedial works to ensure these services will be fully compliant with fire safety standards as set out in Tulsa's registration requirements.</p></reply>

The majority of the apprentices are employed in craft trades such as plumbing, carpentry and joinery, and electrical. A number are also employed in consortia programmes such as accounting technician and cyber security.</p><p>A key commitment of the <i>&lsquo;Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025&rsquo; </i>is to grow the number of apprenticeship registrations across the public service, including local authorities, to reach 750 annual registrations by 2025. This represents in excess of a seven-fold increase on 2020 registrations and will support a long-term goal of 7% of the apprentice population being employed by public service employers. </p><p>The diversity of the public service in terms of service delivery provides a wide basis for involvement with the range of existing apprenticeships and those programmes in development. Apprenticeship provides an opportunity to target and widen the recruitment pool for both generalist and specialist roles within the public service. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s officials have undertaken a number of actions in order to make progress towards achieving this commitment:</p><p>1. Several general and sector-focused information sessions on apprenticeship were held, includingone for local authorities.</p><p>2. A Working Group has been established, representing Government Departments and local authorities, to develop a Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan by summer 2022.  The Group&rsquo;s work will be based on surveying organisations in relation to their skills needs. The content, level and duration of public service apprenticeships will be determined by the identified skills needs</p><p>3. More specifically, there has been extensive bilateral engagement with the LGMA, to assist with surveying local authorities in relation to their skills needs. </p><p>Over 100 public service organisations have now been surveyed and the results are currently being analysed.</p><p>The survey results will inform the development of the Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan, with the content, level, and duration of public service apprenticeships determined by these identified skills needs.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2022 includes significant additional funding to support initiatives under the Youth Justice Strategy and the new Community Safety Innovation Fund, &euro;6.7 million and &euro;2 million respectively, which will support community-based initiatives to ensure public safety. </p><p>In addition, North Inner City Dublin is one of three pilot locations where Local Community Safety Partnerships have been established. The lessons which are learnt in the North Inner City pilot will be of particular relevance to the future rollout nationwide, including in the South Inner City.</p><p>Both the Programme for Government, as well as the Justice Plan 2022 which was published this week, contain a number of commitments to tackle crime and improve community safety, including the ongoing prioritisation of the work of the Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour, charged with considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at proposals for new ways forward.  </p><p>Garda&iacute; continue to implement high visibility policing plans to address public disorder-related issues and anti-social behaviour, with particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and anti-social behaviour typically increase, such as bank holiday weekends. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Citizen commenced in Dublin city centre on 22 October 2021. This operation places a particular focus on anti-social behaviour, public order and quality of life issues, assaults and high-volume crimes, and involves increased visible policing, particularly at key locations. In addition to Garda resources from the Dublin Metropolitan Region North Central and South Central divisions, Operation Citizen is supported by resources from the wider Dublin Region, Garda Roads Policing Units, the Garda National Public Order Unit and Garda Operational Support Units (Mounted Unit and Dog Unit).</p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are in excess of 100 Garda&iacute; patrolling Dublin city centre each weekend evening. Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening from 4pm, up to 30 additional Garda&iacute; are deployed specifically on foot patrols in the city centre, resourced from outside the two core city centre divisions. Every Friday and Saturday evening, a Garda National Public Order Unit of 25 personnel (on mobile patrols) patrols the city centre. In excess of 500 additional hours of policing are provided each week. </p><p>In January this year, the Garda authorities launched Operation Saul to further support, enhance and strengthen the strategic and operational objectives of Operation Citizen. The aim of Operation Saul is to provide a safe environment for commuters utilising public transport services in the DMR.  </p><p>The Deputy may be interested to note that Garda Operation Soteria is also in place to ensure a reduction of assaults in public, reduce fear of violence within communities, prioritise assault investigations and focus on problem areas and assault hotspots.</p><p>A summary of Garda proactive outputs recorded against any of the reported crime incidents associated with Garda operations Citizen, Saul and Soteria is contained in the following table: <table>    <tr>       <th>Operation </th>       <th>Prisoner logs </th>       <th>Charges </th>       <th>Summons </th>       <th>Youth referrals </th>       <th>Adult cautions </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Citizen </td>       <td>887 </td>       <td>1322 </td>       <td>72 </td>       <td>74 </td>       <td>47 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Soteria </td>       <td>655 </td>       <td>865 </td>       <td>125 </td>       <td>129 </td>       <td>22 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Saul </td>       <td>18 </td>       <td>28 </td>       <td>Less than 10 </td>       <td>Less than 10 </td>       <td>Less than 10 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><i>Operation Citizen activity reported between 22 October 2021 and 28 March 2022.</i></p><p><i>Operation Soteria activity reported between 1 January 2021 and 28 March 2022. </i></p><p><i>Operation Saul activity reported between 31 January 2022 and 28 March 2022. </i></p><p><i>It is noted that the Garda information provided is taken from PULSE as of 29 March 2022, is operational and is liable to change.</i></p><p>This combination of targeted Garda operations and Government funding and policy measures are having, and will continue to have, a positive impact on personal safety in Dublin city centre. </p></reply>

This analysis looked at the gap in pay between men and women in the Department and its agencies for 2020. It provides valuable insights into pay disparity and a baseline upon which to measure future performance. </p>  <p>  The analysis showed the unadjusted gender pay gap (straight comparison between the pay of men and women) is 9% for the Department and 8% for the agencies. The adjusted measure attempts to match up males and females across a range of measures, such as number of children and years of service, so that there is, as much as possible, a comparison of like with like. The adjusted gender pay gap is 4% for the Department and its agencies. The analysis highlights the impact of factors such as caring responsibilities on pay disparity, with the gap widening from 2% for employees with no children to 22% for employees with one child and 21% for employees with two children.</p>  <p>  The full report can be found here: www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Department-of-Justice-Gender-Pay-Gap-Report.</p>  <p>  The Department also published its Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy in March 2022 and commits to creating a positive and inclusive work environment where we all feel our contribution is valued and our personal differences and circumstances are cherished and respected. </p>  <p>  The Strategy prioritises three areas of focus for strategic impact:</p>  <p>  - achieve better policy outcomes and improve the accessibility and quality of our services;</p>  <p>  - support the development of a skilled and diverse workforce;</p>  <p>  - build and embed a workplace culture which facilitates, supports and encourages contributions from all</p>  <p>  Each of these strategic outcomes are underpinned by a number of actions which the Department will implement over the life of the EDI Strategy. Specifically, we will use the quantitative data in the Gender Pay Gap Report and do further qualitative work to understand why differences occur, not just in pay but potentially in career progression and opportunities for varied roles.</p>  <p>  This data will also be important in the context of the development of the Department&rsquo;s Blended Working policy which will be published in Q2, 2022. Blended working, as another flexible working arrangement will be available for both men and women and the Department is committed to monitoring any potential disparities including the gender pay gap in its future blended workplace. </p>  <p>  Our EDI Strategy can be found at www.justice.ie/en/JELR/DoJ-EDI-Strategy-(Eng).pdf/Files/DoJ-EDI-Strategy-(Eng).pdf.</p></reply>

The Department of Justice workplace travel plan will incorporate measures to encourage people to walk, cycle, carpool or use public transport.  </p></reply>

It was established so that the State can respond in a timely manner with accurate data on drug and alcohol-related mortality. It is maintained by the Health Research Board (HRB).</p>  <p>  The NDRDI is jointly funded by the Department of Health and the Department of Justice. The NDRDI has a steering committee, co-chaired by the Department of Health and the Department of Justice, which includes among others, representatives of families affected by drug-related deaths, representatives from the Irish Coronial Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the State Laboratory, the Office of the State Pathologist and relevant HSE areas. It complies with the reporting requirements for European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and as such is used to meet Ireland&rsquo;s mandatory reporting requirements to the EU, UN and WHO. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure a complete and accurate census of drug-related deaths it is necessary to use data from several sources. The main source of data comes from closed coronial files which is supplemented by data from the acute hospitals sector (through the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry Scheme), the Central Treatment List and from the General Mortality Register (through the Central Statistics Office). </p>  <p>  The data are collected retrospectively on an annual basis and matched across sources to reduce duplication and ensure the widest range of data for each death. As well as demographic information, information on cause of death, drug misuse history and toxicology are also collected. </p>  <p>  I am committed to reducing and preventing drug-related deaths. To this end, the NDRDI is a vital tool to assess the effectiveness of responses aimed at preventing deaths from drugs or alcohol.</p></reply>

Regardless of whether it is a private, voluntary or public nursing home, the resident's financial contribution is the same; the price of care only affects levels of state funding and has no direct impact on the resident.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, the Department published the independently-chaired Value For Money review on nursing home costs, which reviewed the variance in costs between public and private nursing homes. The review made 9 recommendations to address this issue, all of which are now being taken forward by the Department.</p></reply>

Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service that the HSE may provide. Staff in these section 39 organisations were not subject to the provisions of FEMPI legislation and therefore did not receive those cuts that were applied to the pay of public servants. They were not and are not party to the Public Service Agreements and are therefore not covered by the pay restoration provided for in these Agreements. While it is understood that pay savings were made by the organisations, the precise mix of pay cuts or other savings measures will have varied.</p>  <p>  In October 2018, an agreement was reached by the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed in Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria.  A further WRC engagement followed in December 2020 in relation to a final phase of 250 organisations who were identified as part of the earlier agreement. A payment arrangement consisting of three phases was agreed with the first two payments made in 2021, and the third and final payment due to be made in 2023. </p>  <p>  Pay restoration was applicable to Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. Eligible Section 39 organisations included only agencies that had service arrangements in place back in 2013 and that were still under service arrangements in 2019. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included. </p>  <p>  Pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those included in the initial WRC agreement. I can also confirm that there is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process and that from a Departmental point of view, the process has reached a final resolution.</p></reply>

The role of the Drugs Group is to make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) in relation to each individual application having considered the criteria under the 2013 Act. </p>  <p>  The Drugs Group considers the NCPE assessment, the outputs from commercial engagements, patient interest group submissions, any inputs provided by the Rare Disease Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) and any other pertinent information in advance of providing its recommendation to the HSE EMT.</p>  <p>  As the decision-making authority within the HSE, the HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different rule set when assessing orphan medicines. However, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs, such as small patient populations and unmet clinical need. The overriding factor in medicines, including orphan medicines, making it through the process to reimbursement is the availability of Exchequer resources.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the approval of new drugs and nineteen of the fifty-two new medicines approved by the HSE in 2021 were orphan medicines, representing over one third of approvals.</p>  <p>  The pipeline of new medicines coming to market remains strong and this government wants to secure fast access to medicines for the most vulnerable of our patients, including those for the treatment of rare diseases. The budget allocation of &euro;30m funding for new medicines in Budget 2022 will provide for the reimbursement of both orphan and non-orphan new medicines this year.</p></reply>

There are an estimated 6-8,000 known rare diseases affecting up to 6% of the total EU population, (at least 30 million Europeans), and perhaps up to 300,000 Irish people during their lives.</p>  <p>  It can be a challenge to provide highly specialised treatment or care for patients who have complex conditions. This is especially true when the prevalence of such conditions is low, as is the case for rare diseases. This challenge is due to both the scarcity of expertise and to the scattering of small patient populations across the EU, sometimes in isolated locations where expertise does not exist or cannot be accessed.</p>  <p>  The National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014-2018) is a generic policy framework on the development and delivery of services and care for people with rare diseases.  Many of the recommendations of the Plan have already been implemented including the establishment of a HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO). Meetings have taken place regularly with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Taskforce and priority areas for the future (patient awareness, European Reference Networks, research and registries, access to services, access to medicines, diagnosis, education, legislation and policy) have been agreed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. The HSE is also working on proposals to implement the appropriate Rare Diseases coding system in Irish health care coding systems (Orphacodes). This will support the collation and reporting of rare disease data in the future.</p>  <p>  European Reference Networks (ERNs) are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.  The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks.  These links are emphasized in the report to address the care of patients with rare diseases at both national and European levels.</p>  <p>  ERNs facilitate discussion on complex and rare diseases that require highly specialised treatment and concentrated knowledge and resources. ERNs also create a clear governance structure for knowledge sharing and care coordination across the EU to improve access to diagnosis and treatment, as well as the provision of high-quality healthcare for patients.</p>  <p>  In November 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s 15 applications for entry to these ERNs were approved from 5 academic hospitals. Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.</p>  <p>  The implementation and integration of ERNs to the Irish health system is strategically aligned with the &lsquo;Programme for Government: Our Shared Future&rsquo;, which provided commitment to increase focus on rare diseases through the established of ERNs, in addition to Ireland&rsquo;s first &lsquo;National Plan for Rare Diseases (2014-2018)&rsquo; and the 2019 HSE &lsquo;Model of Care for Rare Diseases&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  The Department has a long track record in supporting rare disease research through the Health Research Board (HRB). In the last 10 years alone, the HRB has invested &euro;14m in rare disease research. Increased focus and investment in this research is making a difference to rare disease patients and their families. Great advances have been made in diagnosis, prognosis and prevention of rare diseases.</p>  <p>  The pipeline of new medicines coming to market remains strong and the Department is committed to funding access to new and innovative therapies, including those for rare diseases. I want to secure faster access to medicines for the most vulnerable of our patients and am committed to making sure all patients with rare diseases get the treatment they need.</p></reply>

The benefits of this model have been realised both during the response to Covid-19 and in preparations for Brexit and provides for supply chain resilience during periods of logistics disruption.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, medicine shortages can occur as they are a feature of modern health systems worldwide. There are a multitude of reasons why a medicine may not be available including: shortages of raw materials; manufacturing difficulties; or product recalls due to potential quality issues. Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicine shortage framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.</p></reply>

The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p><p>  This payment will be made to those eligible public sector frontline healthcare staff (inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE) who worked in clinical settings, noting this list is not exhaustive: those Doctors / Nurses / Health Care Assistants / Porters / Cleaners etc. that work in clinical settings. The measure encompasses Health Care Support Assistants (also known as Home Carers / Home Help) employed by or carrying out duties contracted to the HSE.</p><p>  The measure also encompasses those eligible working on site in long term residential care facilities for people with disabilities (inclusive of those facilities whether HSE or section 39). The measure further extends to those equivalent healthcare workers in private nursing homes and hospices. Arrangements for this sector encompassed by this measure are currently being progressed by the Department of Health.</p><p>  The Department of Health appreciates the levels of interest this announcement has generated. We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply. Additionally, the Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions on this matter. This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly.</p><p>  Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. Noting that the details will be finalised once this consultation has concluded, it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this point.</p></reply>

The report&rsquo;s recommendation led to the establishment of a Project Team to implement this recommendation. </p><p>In February 2019, HSE Community Operations convened a Project Team, chaired by Dr Cathal Morgan, comprised of representatives from Clinical, Counselling and Educational Psychology; Social Care, Disability, and Mental Health services; Community and Acute services; Operational and National HR; and the Health and Social Care Professions office.</p><p>The Project Team was tasked with, <i>inter alia</i>, considering the preparation of a workforce plan for psychological services in the HSE, including an examination of the current framework for training psychologists for the health service, and the type, and skill-mix, required for the future. The work of the Project Team was informed by a thorough stakeholder consultation process.</p><p>Clinical Psychology Trainees, on the doctoral programme, are HSE employees and are in receipt of partial funding (60%) of HEI fees each year. Traditionally the educational and counselling psychologists&rsquo; courses have not been funded by the HSE.  The HSE does not employ or contribute to HEI fees for Counselling and Educational Psychologists during their doctoral training.</p><p>The Report of the National Psychology Project Team, Establishment of a National Psychology Placement Office and Workforce Planning, was completed in January 2021.  The Report contains a plan to address a range of matters in relation to psychology through establishment of a placement office and workforce planning. Implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and the creation of a National Psychology Placement Office are a matter for the HSE in the context of available health resources. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the rates of pay for the grades of Clinical Psychologists and Educational Psychologists are as set out in the Department of Health&rsquo;s Consolidated Salary Scales which are available to view online here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/b556a-application-of-1-october-2021-pay-adjustments/.  As is evidenced within the pay scales document, no disparity exists between these two grades.</p></reply>

One of the central priorities for me as Minister for Health is that waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures are improved, and that children receive the care that they need and deserve in a timely and appropriate fashion. In particular, a special area of focus for me and my Department is that of paediatric orthopaedics.</p>  <p>  In January I asked the HSE to develop a dedicated plan to tackle scoliosis waiting lists this year. In February I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss the finalisation of the proposals to increase orthopaedic activity at CHI. The plan proposes ambitious additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end.</p>  <p>  This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address the issues facing these children. Both current and capital funding has been provided to a value of &euro;19 million in 2022 to support this initiative.</p>  <p>  More specifically, &euro;3.4 million has been committed to support additional activity at Cappagh Orthopaedic hospital. This is the full year requirement associated with the &euro;1.65 million that was provided from the Access to Care Fund in 2021 to support CHI paediatric orthopaedic activity at Cappagh. Furthermore, &euro;4.7 million has been provided on a recurring basis since 2021 to fund an additional 24 beds at Crumlin and Temple street, and 2 high dependency unit beds at Crumlin. These beds will facilitate the increase in activity needed to reduce paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. A further &euro;4 million has been committed for a theatre expansion programme across CHI sites to focus on paediatric orthopaedics.</p>  <p>  Capital funding of &euro;4 million has been designated to support this initiative, which is included within the 2022 Capital Plan due to be approved shortly. Finally, &euro;2 million has been provided for outsourcing initiatives for both inpatient and daycase procedures, as well as to meet radiology needs. Plans are currently being finalised by CHI in this regard.</p></reply>

The health service continues to be overseen by my Department in its current form. The HSE sets out the type and volume of services that will be provided within its financial allocation in its annual National Service Plan. Oversight of HSE performance in relation to the delivery of services and the implementation of initiatives under the Plan is maintained throughout the year by way of the DoH-HSE performance engagement model.</p>  <p>  Under the model, performance delivery is considered across the four equally important domains of access to services, quality and patient safety, finance and workforce. The model provides for monthly meetings at operational level between my Department and HSE counterparts, as well as high-level meetings between senior management in both organisations, to discuss on-going or emerging performance issues and determine actions to improve areas of concern. This model also provides me the opportunity to have quarterly meetings with the Board Chair and an annual meeting with the full HSE Board to review and discuss performance, reform and governance issues.</p>  <p>  However, we accept that aspects of the current model of healthcare delivery are in need of reform. Delivering Sl&aacute;intecare remains a priority for Government and my Department is actively progressing with its implantation in partnership with the HSE. The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023 was approved in May of last year and two subsequent progress reports have been published:</p>  <p>  - Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023 - www.gov.ie/en/publication/6996b-slaintecare-implementation-strategy-and-action-plan-2021-2023/</p>  <p>  - Sl&aacute;intecare Progress Report 2021 published on 15 February 2022 - www.gov.ie/en/publication/9652b-slaintecare-progress-report-2021/</p>  <p>  - Sl&aacute;intecare mid-year Progress Report for 2021 published on 10 September 2021 - www.gov.ie/en/publication/cce45-slaintecare-mid-year-progress-report-for-2021/</p>  <p>  My Department has strengthened the governance around Sl&aacute;intecare with responsibility for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare projects now devolved to a senior leadership team. To ensure that implementation is fully embedded across the Department and that the drive for universal healthcare across both the Department of Health and the HSE, a new Programme Board has been established and has met three times (15 December 2022, 14 February 2022 and 29 March 2022). Reporting to me, the Board is co-chaired by the Secretary-General of the Department and the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE and will also comprise senior members of the Department&rsquo;s Management Board and the HSE&rsquo;s Executive Management Teams.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to Omicron variants.</p><p>As a response to the recent surge in both ED attendance and COVID-19 cases the CEO of the HSE has written to the CEOs of all hospital groups advising them of the need to prioritise unscheduled COVID-19 care and urgent time sensitive work for a 14 day period. The resulting curtailment of elective care( and associated staff shortages) will negatively impact on achieving waiting list reduction targets.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan and to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on waiting list reduction targets.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>Information concerning  waiting lists for specialities for each major general hospital, including Planned Procedures and TCI&rsquo;s are available on the NTPF website at: <i>www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm.</i></p></reply>

NCRI data is used widely in the development of cancer services, service planning and in monitoring progress being made under the National Cancer Strategy. While the NCRI produces reports on the incidence of cancer by HSE region, this operates a number of years in arrears as diagnoses need to be validated to assure completeness and accuracy.</p><p>The NCRI has currently published information on incidence rates for invasive cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) as a whole, and for 25 major cancer types, for 1994-2017 at county scale. This data is provided on the NCRI website via maps for each county and cancer type, which provide the average numbers of cases diagnosed annually, and express this visually as a comparison between the number of cases observed and the number of cases that would be expected (based on average national rates) given the size and age/sex breakdown of the population in each county. </p><p>For invasive cancers as a whole (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) in the 2006-2017 period, the annual average number of cases observed was highest in Co. Dublin, while Co. Cork was highest against the Standardised Incidence Ratio.</p><p>The data on cancer incidence rates can be found on the NCRI's website at the following link: www.ncri.ie/data/maps and the breakdown of the total number of cases for each county from 2013-2017 is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Region</th>       <th>Cases 2013-2017</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Dublin </td>       <td>29,573</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Cork</td>       <td>13,463</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Galway</td>       <td>5,969</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Limerick</td>       <td>4,714</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Kildare</td>       <td>4,182</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Tipperary </td>       <td>4,107</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Kerry</td>       <td>3,938</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Donegal</td>       <td>3,930</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Mayo</td>       <td>3,802</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Meath</td>       <td>3,717</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Wexford</td>       <td>3,592</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Wicklow</td>       <td>3,368</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Waterford</td>       <td>2,972</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Louth</td>       <td>2,934</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Clare</td>       <td>2,819</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Kilkenny</td>       <td>2,072</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Westmeath</td>       <td>2,067</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Sligo</td>       <td>1,791</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Offaly</td>       <td>1,745</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Cavan</td>       <td>1,723</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Roscommon</td>       <td>1,699</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Laois</td>       <td>1,639</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Monaghan</td>       <td>1,334</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Carlow</td>       <td>1,329</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Longford</td>       <td>970</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Co Leitrim</td>       <td>901</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>110,350</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The new facility will accommodate up to 17,000 outpatient and 25,000 emergency care attendances per year.</p>  <p>  Together with the Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital, which opened in July 2019, these new facilities will improve access to urgent, emergency and outpatient care for a significant number of children. In 2021, there were over 13,300 outpatient attendances at Connolly and almost 11,400 patients presented for urgent care as per updated CHI figures.</p>  <p>  Work on the St James&rsquo;s site is ongoing and progressing well with major milestones reached in 2021, including the completion of the concrete frame with over 150,000 cubic metres of concrete poured, the topping out of the building (where the highest point on the building was completed- a significant milestone in any construction project), the infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame, the closing in of the concourse and approximately 17,000 square metres of glazing and 5,800 square metres of external fa&ccedil;ade installed.</p>  <p>  To date, 86,000 square metres of internal partitions have been installed, with the equivalent of over 26 kilometres installed in 2021, and the fit out of most internal areas is now underway, including the south fingers comprising Outpatients, Cardiology Wards, and Therapies spaces, and the &lsquo;Hot Block&rsquo; comprising Emergency Department, Critical Care and Theatres. Work in 2022 will be focused on the progression of the internal fit-out of the over 6,000 internal spaces. Internal fit out ranges from first fix in some areas, whereas others are much further progressed, with ceilings and joinery being fitted.</p>  <p>  The NCH was connected to a permanent supply of power from the ESB network recently, which is another important milestone in the project.</p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) has advised that the main contractor&rsquo;s current schedule outlines completion can be achieved by December 2023 which would mean the NCH at St James&rsquo;s could open in the second half of 2024, after the necessary commissioning period. The NPHDB is working to ensure that contractor will meet its own schedule.</p></reply>

This is key to delivering on the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of an integrated health and social care service where all patients can access high-quality services in a timely manner, as close to home as possible.</p><p>  The 2020 Programme for Government committed to bring forward detailed proposals on the six Regional Health Areas to enable delivery of local services for patients that are safe, of high-quality, and fairly distributed. </p><p>In partnership with the HSE and other key stakeholders, my Department is developing a work programme for their implementation. I intend to bring a memorandum on RHA implementation to Government for decision very shortly.</p><p>Senior Department and HSE officials are leading this work. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is also involved, given the transfer of disability policy to Minister O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s Department.</p><p>  This team of officials is on track to finalise a detailed implementation plan by the end of this year. This will cover how RHAs will impact on workforce and HR planning, funding allocation, capital infrastructure, and governance lines. The team reports on their progress to the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Board which reports directly to me. The work programme will provide for substantial levels of staff engagement and of public engagement in autumn of this year to ensure broad-ranging input to the design of our health and social care services.</p><p>Funding for regions will be determined by a population-based resource allocation formula which will take into account a variety of demographic and geographical factors. This will provide for equitable and transparent funding allocation throughout the country as well as providing greater clarity and oversight of expenditure.</p><p>The completion of population-based profiling and the design of the resource allocation model to determine how resources are allocated to each RHA will be key. The implementation plan will examine the current allocation of resources to each RHA including budget, staff, and infrastructure and will produce reports on these in the current year.</p><p>The implementation plan will review the current budgeting and financial management process and detail new processes to set up RHAs as operational delivery units to enable service planning and funding. In order to enable population-based approaches, new financial reporting structures are required as well as ensuring that financial management systems are fit for purpose. In this regard, the rollout of the Integrated Financial Management System is taking into account the move to RHAs. In addition to population-based funding, activity-based funding will also be progressed to facilitate services provided nationally and between regions.</p><p>The regions will have a &ldquo;one budget, one system&rdquo; approach to ensure equitable resource allocation based on local need, with a view to ensuring that every patient in every region can expect to receive a high level of service, no matter where in the country they live.</p></reply>

Individuals who are vulnerable to COVID-19 are further advised to be aware of the risk associated with activities they may choose to engage in and to take measures to optimally protect themselves. Vulnerable individuals are advised to consider wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, such as may relate, for example, to social gatherings or other activities and events. </p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, the number of the current public patient waiting lists for rheumatology, ophthalmology and neurology in CUH in tabular form including a breakdown of the number of months patients are waiting is outlined in the attached document.

The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p><p>  This payment will be made to those eligible public sector frontline healthcare staff (inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE) who worked in clinical settings, noting this list is not exhaustive: those Doctors / Nurses / Health Care Assistants / Porters / Cleaners etc. that work in clinical settings. The measure encompasses Health Care Support Assistants (also known as Home Carers / Home Help) employed by or carrying out duties contracted to the HSE.</p><p>  The measure also encompasses those eligible working on site in long term residential care facilities for people with disabilities (inclusive of those facilities whether HSE or section 39). The measure further extends to those equivalent healthcare workers in private nursing homes and hospices. Arrangements for this sector encompassed by this measure are currently being progressed by the Department of Health.</p><p>  The Department of Health appreciates the levels of interest this announcement has generated. We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply. Additionally, the Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions on this matter. This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly.</p><p>  Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. Noting that the details will be finalised once this consultation has concluded, it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this point.</p></reply>

Since their inception twenty years ago, these strategies have ensured that the sector has a coherent, stakeholder-led vision and strategy to underpin the sector&rsquo;s continued development. </p><p>The new stakeholder strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, Food Vision 2030, was launched by An Taoiseach Miche&aacute;l Martin TD, myself and Ministerial colleagues Ministers of State Hackett and Heydon on 3rd August 2021. </p><p>The vision of the new Strategy is that<i>&ldquo;Ireland will become a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems over the next decade. This should deliver significant benefits for the Irish agri-food sector itself, for Irish society and the environment. In demonstrating the Irish agri-food sector meets the highest standards of sustainability &ndash; economic, environmental, and social &ndash; this should also provide the basis for the future competitive advantage of the sector. By adopting an integrated food systems approach, Ireland will seek to become a global leader of innovation for sustainable food and agriculture systems, producing safe, nutritious, and high-value food that tastes great, while protecting and enhancing our natural and cultural resources and contributing to vibrant rural and coastal communities and the national economy&rdquo;.</i></p><p>I believe Food Vision is a landmark for the Irish agri-food sector with the potential to transform agriculture, food, forestry and marine in the period to 2030, with economic, environmental and social sustainability at its core.  Some 200 actions under 22 goals are proposed, guided by four high-level missions:</p><p>1. A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector</p><p>2. Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being</p><p>3. Food that is safe, nutritious and appealing: trusted and valued at home and abroad</p><p>4. An Innovative, Competitive  and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, driven by Technology and Talent. </p><p>There are seven Goals in Mission 1 &ldquo;A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-food Sector&rdquo;  which aim to deliver a climate-neutral food system by 2050, with verifiable progress achieved by 2030, encompassing emissions reductions, carbon sequestration, improvements in air quality, restoration and enhancement of biodiversity, improvements in water quality, development of diverse forests, enhanced seafood sustainability, exploring the bioeconomy and strengthening Origin Green. On 4 November Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2021 was launched - this is the most ambitious Climate Action Plan ever produced. The commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are challenging but I know the sector is committed to the challenge. Delivering real results will require collaboration, cooperation, and a sense of shared responsibility between citizens, industry and the State to deliver our environmental ambitions.</p><p>Food Vision 2030 acknowledges that in general, future environmental targets are likely to be set by legislation and commits to participating in the various target-setting processes with a view to the ultimate commitment to be climate neutral by 2050. </p><p>I believe that the success of this Strategy will depend on effective implementation and oversight. For this reason, a Monitoring and Implementation Framework is included in the Strategy. This highlights areas for collaboration and partnership within the sector but also with key external stakeholders. It also details oversight and monitoring mechanisms for implementation, including the establishment of a High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC).  Significant detail is also given on the critically important area of environmental monitoring, including the establishment of a dedicated environmental monitoring group. A detailed Implementation Plan will be published soon.</p><p>In line with one of the outcomes of that first implementation meeting, I established a Food Vision Dairy Group, whose first task will be to &ldquo;produce a detailed plan by Q2 2022 to manage the sustainable environmental footprint of the dairy sector&rdquo;.  Given the importance of providing certainty for the sector, I tasked the Group to provide an initial report to me by end March setting out how emissions associated with the dairy sector can be stabilised, and then reduced, with a final plan to be submitted by the end of quarter two.</p><p>A key priority for the Food Vision Dairy Group is ensuring that we continue to provide a platform of sustainability for our farmers and our sector, economically, environmentally and socially. The new Group includes representatives from the farming organisations, the dairy industry, my Department and relevant agencies.</p><p>I want to ensure the long-term viability of the sector because it is an exciting sector for our farm families. We will continue to be a global leader in the years and decades ahead.</p></reply>

The Ukrainian agriculture minister, Roman Leschenko, spoke via videoconference at the Agri-Fish Council about the impact of the Russian invasion on Ukraine's agriculture.</p>  <p>  My Department has also been engaged at a number of EU meetings in recent weeks to discuss food security issues, including a meeting of the European Food Security Crisis preparedness and Response Mechanism (EFSCM). </p>  <p>  I have outlined to my EU colleagues that Ireland has continued to strongly support the most extensive EU sanctions on Russia for its outrageous actions. We must also ensure that the actions we take in that wider context, together with the burden that must be borne, are sustainable, and this will only be the case if we do all we can to maintain food security, for our own citizens, for the Ukrainian people and in a wider international context.</p>  <p>  I underlined my particular concerns in relation to the impacts of the conflict on agri-food supply chains, and especially on inputs such as fertiliser and feed.  As the situation is obviously a volatile and evolving one, I stressed the need from an EU perspective to continually assess developments, and to be ready to take necessary responses to minimise the impact on our collective food security.</p>  <p>  Following discussions at these meetings the European Commission announced on Wednesday 23 March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs.</p>  <p>  These actions included Support through the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) EU countries' actions to provide food and/or basic material assistance to the most deprived. It also included &euro;500 million to support farmers most affected, including an allocation of &euro;15.8 million to Ireland;  and agreement to deploy market safety net measures, including private storage aid for pigmeat.</p>  <p>  Other actions approved included a new self-standing Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF) for state aid and allowing Member States to derogate from certain greening obligations in 2022 to bring additional agricultural land into production.</p>  <p>  On 22nd March, the Government approved my proposal for a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative, worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers. This package is aimed at producing more native crops while reducing dependency on imports and on crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my EU colleagues to monitor the situation closely and consider all appropriate measures.</p></reply>

At that meeting I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. This Group continues to meet and I continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on these significant challenges.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, I established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis, including in relation to the supply of fertiliser.</p>  <p>  I raised concerns in relation to the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on agri-food supply chains at the extraordinary informal meeting of European Union Agriculture Ministers held on 2nd March and at the AgriFish Council on 21st March.  At these meetings I underlined the need to maintain and keep a very close eye on supply chains and to ensure an effective and functioning Single Market and to be ready to consider any measures that may help to alleviate the difficulties caused.  </p>  <p>  The Commission has already announced a number of support measures, including the introduction of private storage aid for the pigmeat sector, a new exceptional aid support package making available a fund of &euro;500 million for affected sectors (which Member States can match by up to 200%), increased payment advances in 2022 and a new temporary State Aid framework.</p>  <p>  I announced a package of targeted interventions for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers on 22nd March. The package supports the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards lowering demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to actively engage with the fertiliser industry and to monitor supply chains. I'm taking a proactive approach to this situation in order to support our farm families and their businesses through this time of considerable challenge. </p></reply>

We will work with EU partners to consider, and implement, appropriate responses.  This includes ensuring that food security is maintained for EU citizens, for the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context.</p>  <p>  In addition to the immediate humanitarian crisis, which must take priority, there will be implications across all sectors. Considerable volumes of both global feed and fertiliser originate and are traded through Ukraine and Russia. In addition, the food industry largely relies on natural gas for its energy supply, so costs will escalate and increases in consumer prices are likely. However, specifically on food exports, it is not currently expected that the war in Ukraine will have a major impact, as exports to Russia and Ukraine constituted less than .5% of total agri-food exports in 2021.</p>  <p>  At farm level, across the dairy, beef, pig, sheep, poultry and tillage sectors, the crisis is likely to have serious impacts on the price and availability of animal feed and fertiliser, which are vital farm inputs.</p>  <p>  Fertiliser stocks nationally are estimated to be reduced year-to-date versus last year, however there is adequate supplies to meet farmers&rsquo; spring requirements although prices have risen considerably. There are sufficient supplies of animal feed at present and importers are actively competing on the global market to ensure that supply continues uninterrupted. Energy price inflation is obviously an issue across the whole economy and the Government has already taken action and will continue to consider additional measures in this regard.</p>  <p>  On 22nd March, the Government approved my proposal for a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative, worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers. This package is aimed at producing more native crops while reducing dependency on imports and on crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser, which is limited in supply as a result of the invasion.</p>  <p>  The new National Fodder and Food Security Committee, which I have established, will play an important role in discussing contingency plans and providing advice to farmers on how to manage with constrained fertiliser supplies if that proves necessary.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  Following recent discussions at EU level, the European Commission announced on Wednesday 23 March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs. The communication sets out actions in three areas:</p>  <p>  - First, it presents immediate actions to safeguard food security in Ukraine and around the world.</p>  <p>  - Second, it addresses the challenge of food stability in the EU's food system, with a range of measures to support our farmers and maintain affordability for our citizens.</p>  <p>  - Finally, it confirms the EU agenda to make our food system sustainable and resilient in the years to come.</p>  <p>  It includes &euro;500 million to support farmers most affected and agreement to deploy measures to support specific markets and allow for increased levels of advances of direct payments later this year. Other actions approved included a new self-standing Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF) for state aid and allowing Member States to derogate from certain greening obligations in 2022 to bring additional agricultural land into production. It includes an allocation of &euro;15.8 million for Ireland, which can be topped up by national funding.</p>  <p>  I will be examining ways to best mobilise this support as soon as possible, taking account of the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this exceptional aid provision. The EU package also includes plans to deploy market safety net measures to support specific markets including private storage aid for pigmeat.</p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with all our stakeholders and will continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal.</p></reply>

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. </p>  <p>  This scheme is a once off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 inclusive. This includes pigs sent to slaughter, exported or sold commercially from a breeding herd. </p>  <p>  The scheme was notified to the European Commission under the agriculture de minimis rules, which provide for a maximum payment per undertaking of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  Applications for the PEPS closed on 20th March 2022. The first tranche of payments was made last week, with the remaining applications due for processing as soon as possible. All information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  This scheme is part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.</p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the  options potentially available to them. </p>  <p>  There is also support for access to finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), particularly the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Both of these SBCI finance products, which are part-financed by my Department, can be used for working capital and include features which will assist the current financial needs of pig farmers.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department continues to engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, including through the European Food Security Crisis preparedness response Mechanism (EFSCM). Last week the Commission announced the adoption of exceptional support measures across the agriculture sector, along with a communication on Food Security. In addition, the Commission in view of the particularly difficult situation in the pig meat sector has opened a new private storage aid scheme to assist in stabilising the sector.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to the exceptional aid allocation to Ireland of &euro;15.8 million in EU funding. </p></reply>

The total package is projected to cost in the region of &euro;12.2 million.</p>  <p>  The package seeks to incentivise the planting of additional tillage crops for this coming planting season through the Tillage Incentive Scheme. It is proposed to encourage farmers to grow more tillage crops in 2022 versus 2021. Eligible crops include the cereal crops barley, wheat, oats, rye, oilseed rape, maize, beet and potatoes. A payment of &euro;400 per hectare is proposed. The proposed budget for the Scheme is &euro;10 million and is aimed at encouraging an additional 25,000 hectares of tillage crops, which would be a significant increase in tillage area. This level of increase will not achieve self-sufficiency in terms of animal feed due to the high protein requirements of our pig and poultry sector but the extra tonnage of grain will reduce our reliance on imports to some degree. </p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the extra tonnage likely to be generated from cereal growing in 2022 as we are some time away from harvest and weather coupled with growing conditions for the spring and summer as well as at harvest time will determine the harvest yields and quality. However, I do note that Teagasc has estimated the winter crop area in 2021 to be approximately 5% higher than in 2020 and crops have come through the winter period in good condition, which bodes well for the cereal harvest this year. </p>  <p>  In terms of extra incentives, I am committed to encouraging native grain production and both I and my Department will continue to assess and support this objective.</p></reply>

Some 200 actions under 22 goals are proposed to fulfil the vision of Ireland becoming a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems over the next decade, guided by four high-level missions: 1. A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector 2. Viable and  Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being 3. Food that is safe, nutritious and appealing: trusted and valued at home and abroad 4. An Innovative, Competitive  and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, driven by Technology and Talent.</p>  <p>  There are seven Goals in Mission 1 &ldquo;A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-food Sector&rdquo;  which aim to deliver a climate-neutral food system by 2050, with verifiable progress achieved by 2030, encompassing emissions reductions, carbon sequestration, improvements in air quality, restoration and enhancement of biodiversity, improvements in water quality, development of diverse forests, enhanced seafood sustainability, exploring the bioeconomy and strengthening Origin Green. On 4 November Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2021 was launched - this is the most ambitious Climate Action Plan ever produced. The commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are challenging but I know the sector is committed to the challenge. Delivering real results will require collaboration, cooperation, and a sense of shared responsibility between citizens, industry and the State to deliver our environmental ambitions. I recently chaired the second High-Level Implementation Committee meeting of Food Vision 2030, where we discussed progress on implementing key Food Vision priorities, including the work of a new Food Vision Environmental Group and a Food Vision Dairy Group.</p>  <p>  In the context of the current crisis following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it is important to recognise that Ireland is part of the EU single market and participates in the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), which is the key mechanism for ensuring food security throughout Europe. Significant implications are being seen across all sectors, including the agri-food sector. As well as the immediate humanitarian crisis, which must take priority, we need to take the necessary steps to ensure that food security is maintained, for EU citizens, for the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context. Following discussions at these meetings the European Commission announced on Wednesday 23 March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs.</p>  <p>  At farm level, the crisis is already impacting very significantly on the price of animal feed, fertiliser and fuel. Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis. I have tasked a National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. On 22nd March, the Government approved my proposal for a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative, worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers. This package is aimed at producing more native crops and reducing dependency on imports, and on producing crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with all our stakeholders and will continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis using all of the tools at our disposal.  </p></reply>

The funding covers the purchasing of processing equipment as well as the renovation and extension of production facilities and supports participants in the artisan food and beverage sector in areas such as market development, competitiveness, and innovation.</p>  <p>  Teagasc and other research institutions are developing innovation and pilot processing centres. For example, my Department has provided funding to establish the Prepared Consumer Food (PCF) Centre in Ashtown, which provides an important service to the Prepared Consumer Food sector through specialist expertise, state of the art facilities and innovative research by Teagasc and industry partners. The PCF Centre enables researchers and industry to collaborate in private and public research projects in the prepared consumer foods arena and to pilot and develop food products for placing on both the domestic and export market.</p>  <p>  As well as leading the marketing and promotion of Irish food and drink in our export markets, Bord Bia has an important role in promoting quality assured food and drink on the domestic market, through targeted marketing and communications campaigns, while respecting EU state aid rules.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the measures in place and the commitments in both the Programme for Government and Food Vision 2030 will provide a sound basis for the future development of the agri-food sector in Ireland, including further developing the domestic market. </p></reply>

In respect of Ireland, 22% of all fertiliser imports in 2021 came from Russia. </p>  <p>  The significant price rise for gas over the past six months means that it may not be economical for several European fertiliser plants to continue at full capacity, putting further pressure on supply. More than 40% of EU gas comes from Russia. The absence of these fertiliser supplies on the world market would have a further impact on commodity availability and price. </p>  <p>  Sourcing of alternative sources of fertiliser and fertiliser raw materials is challenging and expensive as the rest of the world is also seeking access. However, fertiliser importers are actively competing to ensure that supply continues uninterrupted. North Africa is seen as an alternative source for some fertiliser and raw materials but domestic quotas and longer shipping times are issues of concern.</p>  <p>  We continue to actively engage with the main importers of fertiliser and fertiliser raw materials on issues around supply and availability and will continue to monitor the current issues being faced by the sector. </p>  <p>  At a meeting of farm organisations on 8th March, I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee to explore all options to minimise the impact on farms and plan in the short to medium term.

The average 2021 R3 Steer price of 407.95c/kg was 12.5% above the 2020 average price of 362.71c/kg. Central Statistics Office (CSO) data shows an increase in value of beef exports of 3% to &euro;2.4 billion 2021 in spite of a reduction in volume of 14% in comparison to 2020. </p>  <p>  Teagasc forecasts that EU beef supply will decline in 2022 and that UK supply will remain unchanged.   The outlook for Irish beef exports to EU27 and the UK remains generally positive for 2022 according to Bord Bia. Global market demand seems set to remain good with tight global supplies.</p>  <p>  The Teagasc Sustainability Survey shows that the top performing third of farms emitted, on average, 9.6 kg CO2 equivalent per kg beef, compared with 14.9 kg for the bottom performing third of cattle farms. Reducing this variability is a real opportunity to make progress in reducing emissions from cattle production in Ireland with positive economic dividend on the farms concerned. </p>  <p>  Schemes such as the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) and Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme-Sucklers (BEEP-S) are focused on improving the carbon efficiency of the beef herd.</p>  <p>For sheep, total slaughtering for 2021 was 5% down on 2020 at 2,720,467 head.  The average 2021 price of 664.49c/kg was 28% above the 2020 average price of 519.27c/kg. Tighter global and EU supplies of sheepmeat, combined with firm demand, resulted in a positive market for Irish sheep­meat during 2021. According to CSO data, the value of sheepmeat exports increased strongly for the second consecutive year, rising by 8.3% to &euro;385 in 2021.  This was despite a drop of 9.9% in export volumes over the same period.</p>  <p>  Tighter global supplies of sheep­meat and the redistribution of global supplies have helped drive higher export values for Irish exporters and these trends seem set to continue in 2022.  </p>  <p>  Enhancing access for Irish sheep meat in third country markets remains a key component of my Department&rsquo;s market access goals. The Irish food industry is well positioned to gain from the opportunities presented by expanding global demand for high-quality Irish beef and lamb.</p></reply>

This strong focus on the environment, and on sustainable production, is consistent with EU and National obligations on climate change, biodiversity and water quality. </p><p>I consider that Ireland's draft Plan strikes an appropriate balance between the needs and demands of all stakeholders - of which there are many - and the need to secure approval from the European Commission, including in relation to the level of environmental and climate ambition to be attained.</p><p>I also recognise the crucial role that the CAP plays in underpinning our world class production systems. The indicative financial allocation for the Plan over its five years is more than &euro;9.8 billion, with a significant increase in the National co-funding rate from approximately 47% under the previous Rural Development Programme to almost 60% in the period from 2023 to 2027. Proposed rates of payment across the various measures are set out in the draft CSP, and attached in Table 1.</p><p>The CAP also provides for supports for food promotion, marketing and education programmes, as well as for measures to address market volatility.  These latter measures - for example in the form of private storage aid for the pigmeat sector and wider exceptional aid - are currently being activated to address the impacts arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine</p></reply>

There was encouraging signs in 2021 as TB levels were lower than in 2020, with fewer reactors and a lower herd incidence. </p><p>The 12 month rolling herd incidence at 26<sup>th</sup>December 2021 was 4.34% compared to 4.37% on 27<sup>th</sup>December 2020, while the overall number of reactors on 26<sup>th</sup>December 2021 was 20,875 compared to 23,055 on 27<sup>th</sup>December 2020. </p><p>If downward momentum can be maintained, it will reflect the progress achieved by the renewed TB Eradication Strategy launched in January 2021. Implementation of this strategy is overseen by the Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum with support from three working groups on science, implementation and finance to ensure that all aspects of the Strategy are addressed.  We now have the building blocks in place to lower disease incidence and reduce the challenges associated with a TB restriction.</p><p>The reasons for increase in disease over the last number of years are multifactorial and often relate to a combination of national and local factors. </p><p>The expansion of the dairy herd since 2015 has played a role in this, since dairy herds, larger herds, fragmented farms and herds which introduce more cattle are all more at risk of TB breakdowns. Wildlife is also a factor.</p><p>The causes of TB outbreaks are, as I said, multi-factorial, varying from county to county, and even within counties, and requiring a range of actions to address the problem. </p><p>Within each county, the TB programme focuses on testing compliance and frequency, isolation of reactors, wildlife, how disease is distributed in the area, contiguous programmes, forward and backward tracing of risk animals, gamma interferon testing and cleansing and disinfection. </p><p>Each TB outbreak is investigated by a Department Veterinary Inspector to identify the source of infection. In every outbreak involving two or more standard reactors, a veterinarian visits the farm, to advise the herdowner on how to eliminate infection and on the measures needed to help reduce the risk of recurrence.</p></reply>

This group works closely with all areas of my Department in driving gender balance, through focus on career opportunities and participation in promotion competitions for all staff, supporting staff with caring responsibilities and work-life balance initiatives.</p><p>My Department monitors its gender pay gap and has seen a narrowing of this pay gap from 20.5% in 2013 to 11.9% in 2021.  </p><p>My Department and its agencies regularly encourage their staff to participate in <i>Women in Agriculture</i>and <i>Women in STEM </i>events.  In addition, I am committed to achieving the Government target of 40% gender balance on the Boards of our 12 State Bodies.</p><p>The recently published agri-food strategy, <i>Food Vision 2030</i>, recognises the importance of gender balance to the long-term sustainable future for primary producers and includes actions to promote and improve gender balance at all levels, including at senior management and board level, as well as capturing and publishing gender data on policy implementation e.g. participation by women in schemes and measures. It also includes a commitment to hold a National Dialogue on Women in Agriculture.</p><p>I am proud to have put forward the following package of measures on gender equality in the CAP Strategic Plan were proposed by Ireland:</p><p>- Increased rate of grant aid to 60% for women aged 41-66 years under TAMS Investments</p><p>- Knowledge Transfer Programme - Women only KT Groups</p><p>- European Innovation Partnerships &ndash; potential for a call for proposals to incentivise women&rsquo;s participation in agriculture.</p><p>- Improved recording, collection and reporting on Gender data across all CAP schemes.</p><p>All CAP interventions will be developed with a gender aware perspective to ensure there are no inherent barriers to women&rsquo;s participation.  The National CAP Network established in the CAP Strategic Plan will be leveraged to increase the involvement of all women in the implementation of CAP. This will include events and support for women and a women&rsquo;s sub-committee to lead such activities.</p><p>The ACORNS programme is funded under the Rural Innovation and Development Fund through my Department.  Its objective is to encourage a stronger level of enterprise development in rural areas by seeking out and assisting start-up female entrepreneurs living in rural areas to grow and develop their businesses. </p><p>My Department is a core member of the <i>Agri-food Diversity and Inclusion Forum </i>(AgDif), led by Bord Bia and Aon, in partnership with the 30% Club.

Employees are encouraged to cycle to work where possible. To facilitate this, there are bike racks in each office, as well as showers available for staff who choose an active commute to work. My Department also promotes the tax incentivised Cycle to Work scheme, which aims to encourage staff to cycle to and from work, and the Tax Saver Commuter Ticket Scheme for use on public transport.</p><p>The Department also has a health and wellbeing programme whereby staff are encouraged to lead an active and healthy lifestyle. A range of initiatives have been rolled out, including walking challenges, which encourage staff to embrace physical activity as a means to contribute to the enjoyment of significant health and environmental benefits. As staff in my Department attend the office, the Human Resources unit is encouraging them to try to include an active element in their journey.  </p><p>The table below outlines how the Department's four agencies under its remit encourage and facilitate employees to use active travel to commute to work. <table>    <tr>       <th>Charities Regulator </th>       <th>The Charities Regulator takes part in the Cycle to Work Scheme and provides showers and bike racks for staff who choose an active commute. </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Western Development Commission (WDC) </td>       <td>The WDC actively encourages employees to walk or cycle to work where possible and has opened offices in Galway and Sligo, as well as Ballaghaderreen, to facilitate local access for employees and to improve delivery to the citizen.
