The number of people directly employed in multinational companies in Ireland grew to 275,384, this is the highest level of foreign direct investment employment ever reached. The creation of more than 29,000 new jobs during the year is a great achievement in what remains a challenging environment.</p><p>The strong flow of projects observed during 2021 were significantly ahead of target and in line with pre-pandemic averages. This increase was driven by the expansion of existing clients and better than anticipated new name performance.  The regions performed exceptionally well, winning 54% of total projects and the largest number on record at 133. </p><p>It was against a backdrop of predicted global falls in FDI levels that the IDA's <i>Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth</i>Strategy for 2021-2024 was launched.  The Strategy aims to ensure that FDI can make a significant contribution to the recovery and future growth of the economy.<b></b>The targets set to achieve this are to<b>: </b>win 800 total investments, to support job creation of 50,000 and economic activity; partner with clients for future growth through 170 Research, Development &amp;amp; Innovation and 130 training investments; win 400 investments to advance regional development; embrace a green recovery with 60 sustainability investments and to target a 20% increase in client expenditure in Ireland to maximise the impact of FDI.</p><p>Despite the challenges thrown up in the last two years, Ireland has proved to be a resilient and stable platform for companies choosing to invest here, 7% growth in IDA supported companies, compared to 3.6% in 2020, is notable given the global environment in which Ireland competes for foreign direct investment is constantly changing. The coming period will be characterised by an accelerated pace of change set against an exceptionally challenging economic backdrop, however, I remain confident that Ireland will continue to remain an attractive location for FDI in the future.</p></reply>

Last year, I formally requested that the Low Pay Commission examine this issue.</p>  <p>  To inform its considerations, the Low Pay Commission asked the ESRI to conduct background technical research on a universal basic income under the terms of the Low Pay Commission-ESRI research partnership agreement. The study will examine the universal basic income pilots that have taken place in other jurisdictions to identify what was learned and what might be relevant to a pilot in Ireland. It will also seek to identify which policy objectives a universal basic income pilot could address and its associated risks and financial implications. It will conclude with recommendations on how a pilot in Ireland might be designed and run.</p>  <p>  The ESRI is currently finalising its report and the Low Pay Commission intends to provide a report to me on this research and its recommendations in Q2 2022. I expect to be able to publish both the ESRI report and the LPC's report shortly after that.</p></reply>

The regime is designed to accommodate the arrival of non-EEA nationals to fill skills and labour gaps for the benefit of our economy, in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  The occupations lists are subject to twice yearly evidence-based review and take account of research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SOLAS) and the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), a public consultation process, input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.</p>  <p>  In support of supply chains and cognisant of the ongoing issues facing retail, transport and logistic operators, exacerbated by COVID-19 and Brexit, I announced on 27 October 2021, that any HGV drivers recruited from outside the EEA will be eligible for an employment permit without the limitation of a quota. The quota had been in existence since 2017 and was extended previously in 2019.</p>  <p>  Permits for HGV drivers may be granted to the holders of valid mutually recognised CE/C1E licences.  At present four countries are covered by mutual recognition agreements for CE/C1E licences &ndash; South Africa, Australia, Japan and South Korea.</p>  <p>Applications for employment permits are processed in date order.  Applicants can keep track of Employment Permit applications current processing dates at enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Current-Application-Processing-Dates.</p></reply>

We aim to foster strong, resilient businesses, that are successful and sustainable, while meeting our sector&rsquo;s climate targets.</p><p><i><i>Climate Toolkit for Business</i></i></p><p>My department, in conjunction with Minister Ryan's department, have launched the Climate Toolkit for Business, which aims to encourage all SMEs to start their zero-carbon journey. The Toolkit provides an estimate of the carbon footprint of the business based on some simple information input and generates a tailored action plan and highlights relevant state programmes and funding that can assist in implementing the recommended actions. These actions will be in the areas of energy use, water use, materials use and transport. By implementing them, businesses will be well on their way to a greener future.</p><p>Officials in my department and in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications engaged with a Steering Group which was made up of representatives of relevant state agencies and business representation organisations throughout the development of the Climate Toolkit 4 Business.</p><p><i><i>Local Enterprise Offices</i></i></p><p>In March 2021, I launched the Local Enterprise Office Green for Micro programme. This programme offers green transition advice and technical support to micro-enterprises. Qualifying SMEs receive two days of intensive mentoring, including a sustainability audit, and design an action plan to reduce their carbon footprint. Local Enterprise Offices approved 269 Green for Micro projects in 2021, helping to prepare micro-enterprises for the low carbon, more resource efficient economy of the future.</p><p><i><i>Enterprise Ireland Initiatives </i></i></p><p>In 2021, Enterprise Ireland launched the Climate Enterprise Action Fund. It consists of three initiatives designed to help SMEs on their sustainability journey:</p><p>- Climate Action Voucher &ndash; a &euro;1,800 grant to engage consultants to develop plans in areas such as resource efficiency and renewable energy.</p><p>- GreenStart grant &ndash; up to &euro;5,000 to measure carbon footprint and identify actions to reduce emissions and operate more sustainably.</p><p>- GreenPlus &ndash; grant funding of up to 50% to develop a multi-annual climate change plan aligned to international standards and frameworks.</p><p>Since the Climate Enterprise Action Fund was launched in 2021, 150 projects have been approved: 84 Climate Action Vouchers, 52 GreenStarts and 14 GreenPlus projects were grant aided.</p><p><i>Enterprise Forum</i></p><p>I will also shortly chair the Enterprise Forum where the Department will meet with Enterprise sector stakeholders, including representatives from ISME, SFA, RGData, the Retail sector, Chamber Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to discuss key issues including Climate Action.</p></reply>

In order to improve traceability of waste received and to counter the trade in stolen metal, an amendment to the Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) Regulations was introduced in 2014 to require the following at all permitted facilities receiving/purchasing waste:</p>  <p>  the production of proof of identity and current address for the person supplying the material;</p>  <p>  - records to be kept of the registration number and waste collection permit number of the delivery vehicle;</p>  <p>  - records to be kept describing the materials, time and date of sale, weight and amount paid; and</p>  <p>  - the provision of a signed statement by the person supplying the material indicating that they are the lawful owner.</p>  <p>  The Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) have issued guidance to all waste facility permit holders, including Authorised Treatment Facilities (ATFs) for end-of-life vehicles, advising them of their responsibilities and local authorities continue to undertake inspections to ensure compliance with the regulations. These inspections have been included in the National Waste Enforcement Priorities for 2022 and the WERLAs are working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating incidences of catalytic convertor theft in particular.My Department also participates in the National Metal Theft Forum, which was established in 2012 by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to bring together stakeholders, including local authorities, the Department of Justice, and industry representatives, in order to improve information sharing and to develop a metal theft prevention and crime reduction plan.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce any further measures around traceability requirements at this time, although enforcement of the existing regulations remains a priority for the WERLAs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-09a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900063#WRB02200"><p>The Question refers to a premises located in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map which is available on my Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie. The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living close to a fibre network, owned by a commercial operator, but cannot obtain a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 31 January, almost 296,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 154,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and over 54,500 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties.  In County Tipperary surveying is underway in the Deployment Area of Cahir, surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Nenagh and Mullinahone, pre works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Cashel and Roscrea and main works are ongoing in the Deployment Areas of Tipperary and Clonmel. To date over 17,000 premises in County Tipperary have been surveyed, with almost 8,000 premises under construction and over 2,700 premises now available to order or pre-order.  </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Tipperary through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract.

The map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high speed broadband through the State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed in November 2019 with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).  The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard. </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living close to a fibre network owned by commercial operator, but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic.

CRU, through their existing enforcement functions will be able to direct ESBN and suppliers to comply with their functions under the Bill. The scheme will be operated by the Distribution System Operator (ESB Networks) because of its existing interface with all electricity suppliers. ESB Networks will make payments to electricity suppliers, who in turn will credit all the domestic electricity accounts held with them with &euro;100.</p>  <p>  More generally, CRU have responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas retail markets as set out under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. CRU has in place a suite of protections against disconnection that are set out in the Supplier Handbook. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year while a CRU moratoria on disconnections for all customers comes into effect over the Christmas period. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on general energy regulatory matters to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  Since the beginning of the roll-out of energy poverty schemes, over 146,000 homes have received free upgrades.  The average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household in 2021 in the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme was &euro;17,100.  </p><p>For works completed in 2021, the latest data shows that the average waiting time from application date to works completed was approximately 26 months.  The SEAI has advised that wait times may vary, based on a number of issues. For instance, once the survey is completed and works are allocated to a contractor, the time to complete works is dependent on a number of factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials, weather and in recent years COVID-19 restrictions.  Waiting times have significantly increased as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions where contractors were unable to carry out works for approximately 12 months.  </p><p>There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme.

The Strategy includes 20 separate measures to safeguard public sector networks and essential services, to support the development of Ireland's cyber security industry and ensure we play our part in defending a free, open, secure and stable cyberspace.  </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Strategy, in 2021 external consultants were commissioned to conduct a Capacity Review and to benchmark the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) with similar agencies in Europe and internationally. On foot of the Review, in July the Government agreed a number of measures to support the continued development of the NCSC over the coming five years. The measures agreed include increasing the overall fulltime staffing complement of the NCSC to at least 70 over the next 5 years, with a first tranche of an additional 20 staff recruited by the end of the year bringing the serving complement to 45. A cyber security graduate training programme will also be introduced. In addition, the General Scheme of a Bill will be prepared for Government approval to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis and provide for related matters including clarity around its mandate. </p>  <p>  The NCSC also has an extremely strong relationship with both the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including in sharing information on trends, developments and incidents and in sharing capacity and best practice. The NCSC also works to support Government Departments and other public bodies to improve the resilience and security of their IT systems to better protect services that people rely upon, and their data, and the NCSC works very closely with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department has also recently published the baseline cyber security standard to be applied by all Government Departments and Agencies. The NCSC has worked with colleagues across Government to develop the standard which will support public bodies to identify cyber risks, deploy appropriate mitigation measures, and protect personal and other important data. In addition, the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) based within in the NCSC, has developed and deployed technology on the infrastructure of a Government Departments, to detect and warn of certain types of threat.  </p></reply>

It faces two imminent and important milestones in the coming months - Government approval of the Preliminary Business Case in line with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the submission of a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The MetroLink project has been subject to extensive non-statutory public consultation and comprises the 19km route from north of Swords to the southern edge of the city centre, as outlined in the Preferred Route published by Transport Infrastructure Ireland. </p><p>Secondly we have the statutory review of the <i>Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area</i>. The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 (as amended) stipulates that the <i>Strategy</i>must be reviewed every six years and this review provides an opportunity to re-examine and re-consider proposals for inclusion in the revised <i>Strategy</i>. The National Transport Authority (NTA), as part of its review, considered whether additional metro routes, above and beyond MetroLink, should be included in any revised <i>Strategy</i>.</p><p>As you are aware, the NTA published the draft <i>Strategy </i>in November 2021, along with a suite of background reports (including the <i>Metro to Knocklyon Feasibility Study</i>), to facilitate an informed public consultation process which has only just recently concluded. Submissions received as part of that consultation process are now under review by the NTA.</p><p>Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a direct reply.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-09a.86.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900064#WRC03300"><p>It is assumed that the Deputy's  question relates to the tax treatment of the lessor in a rental transaction involving a second home. </p><p>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  Ireland has a progressive income tax system which is structured such that the more income you have, the more tax you pay. As a person&rsquo;s income increases, they move up through the various rates and bands and, as a result, while the levels of take home pay increase overall, the amount of tax they pay also increases. </p><p>However, if the issue behind the Deputy's question is whether the current tax treatment of private landlords is a factor that is driving rent price increases, I would note that tax changes in this space in recent years have been aimed at encouraging supply through a relatively modest reduction in the burden of taxation on such persons.  Essentially, they involved the implementation of two of the short-term options presented in the <i>Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers</i>(2017).

The tax provisions are intended to create a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation and structured finance purposes.  The section 110 regime enables noteholders to invest through one structured vehicle, without giving rise to an additional layer of tax as compared to a direct investment in the underlying assets.</p><p>Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk and, by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing.  It is accepted that having the option for more diversified sources of financing is good for investment and business.  It is also important for financial stability in the economy, as the ability to securitise loan books plays an important role in allowing banks to meet their capital requirement obligations and to continue lending to businesses and individuals.</p><p>To come within the section 110 regime, a company must be a &ldquo;qualifying company&rdquo; and fulfil a number of conditions, including in relation to the type of assets that the company can hold and in turn the nature of activities that may be undertaken by the company. To be a qualifying company, section 110 TCA 1997 requires (among other things) that:</p><p>(1) The company is tax resident in Ireland and carries on the business of holding or managing &quot;<i>qualifying assets</i>&quot;.  Generally speaking, qualifying assets are assets in respect of which securitisation transactions are undertaken.  This includes a broad range of financial and other assets including shares, bonds, derivatives, loans, deposits, commodities, plant and machinery and invoices and other types of receivable. </p><p>(2) The value of qualifying assets is at least &euro;10 million at the time they were acquired by the section 110 company.</p><p>(3) Apart from the holding or managing of the qualifying assets, the company is not carrying on any other activities. </p><p>Department of Finance officials, together with officials in Revenue, monitor the sector and the operation of section 110 on an ongoing basis, with a view to taking action should it be deemed necessary. </p><p>For example, in 2019 Department officials prepared a report on Real Estate Investment Trusts, Irish Real Estate Funds and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market. This report was presented to the Tax Strategy Group in July 2019 and informed the amendments to the section 110 regime introduced in Finance Act 2019. These amendments strengthened the significant restrictions to the deductions which a section 110 company can claim for payment of profit participating notes to a specified person. The amendments also placed the section&rsquo;s main purpose test on an objective basis, which enables Revenue to more effectively challenge abuse of the legislation. </p></reply>

It included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme. Government approved the enhanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2Bn. The comprehensive changes include:</p>  <p>-  The current 90% maximum grant will be increased to a 100% grant  for all remediation options 1-5.</p>  <p>-  The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000. </p>  <p>-  The grant calculation methodology in respect of option 1 remediation will be based on a cost per square foot with grant costings to be set by my Department following receipt of information on up to date construction costs from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). An indicative rate of &euro;145 per square foot for the first 1,000 sq foot with a sliding scale thereafter has been announced by my Department and this will be subject to review as required in line with construction cost changes. In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate grant rate for blockwork removal and  replacement following receipt of advice from SCSI. The SCSI will  be completely independent in their engagement with my Department on construction costs.</p>  <p>-  A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over  testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and  local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option  and grant amount for each home. </p>  <p>-  Alternative  accommodation  and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>-  In  relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a second grant option, will be available for such a  home in the future if  blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work  subsequently proves  defective in accordance with the IS;465 standard.</p>  <p>-  A  new independent appeals process will be introduced.</p>  <p>-  &euro;5,000 will be available for essential immediate repair works recommended by a building professional as part of the Building Condition Assessment process.</p>  <p>-  The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered  rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on  the  remediation option used. Opportunities for the State to acquire such rental properties for social housing purposes  will  also be examined.</p>  <p>  Full details in relation to the changes announced are available at the following link;</p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e365e-minister-obrien-announces-enhancements-to-the-defective-concrete-block-scheme/  </p>  <p>  I aim to bring the required primary legislation to give effect to the enhanced scheme before the Oireachtas as soon as possible with Spring 2022 being the indicative target timeline. </p>  <p>  In the immediate term I am making amendments to the Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020 which will allow for the recoupment of Engineer fees to homeowners who have applied for entry into the scheme. Furthermore, as part of these amended regulations, up to &euro;5,000 will be recoupable as an allowable cost under the scheme for essential immediate repair works which are deemed necessary by a homeowners engineer under a Building Condition Assessment report. </p></reply>

The Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides for two new affordable purchase schemes, which will both be targeted at moderate-income households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will see local authorities make homes available for purchase on their own land.  Regulations to set out the detailed criteria for the Scheme are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The first affordable purchase homes will be made available on an administrative basis at Boherboy in Cork next month. Cork City Council has indicated these will cost &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom, and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling. These will be followed by a scheme at Dun Emer in Dublin, where Fingal County Council has indicated a 2-bed apartment will cost &euro;166,000, and a 3-bed dwelling will be between &euro;206,000 and &euro;258,000. </p>  <p>  Separately, the First Home affordable purchase scheme will operate for the period 2022 to 2026, deploying overall c. &euro;400m jointly funded by the State and retail banks. It will support eligible first-time buyers to buy a new-build home in private developments. A new First Home Designated Activity Company, incorporated in December, will operate this scheme. Significant work is continuing on the detailed design and parameters of the scheme, and full details will be confirmed upon completion of this work. It is anticipated that initial activity on key areas of work, including public communications, will be undertaken in Q1 in advance of First Home&rsquo;s first receipt of applications and deployment of equity support, scheduled for Q2 this year.</p></reply>

The Fund is providing part-funding for projects that will enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and large towns, while also ensuring that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit.</p>  <p>   In keeping with the aims of the National Planning Framework and Project Ireland 2040, the URDF demonstrates a new and more tailored approach to the provision of Government support.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-09a.157.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900066#WRE01200"><p>The Passport Service is currently processing 45% of adult online renewal application in one working day, while 99% of online child renewal passports are issued within the advertised processing time of 15 working days. The processing times for these standard online renewal passport applications compare very favourably to processing times internationally in countries such as the UK, United States, Canada and Australia.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications do take longer to process and there are a number of reasons for this: </p>  <p>- It is important to check the applicant&rsquo;s identity and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th   in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries. This is something we can all be proud of. However, in order to maintain this ranking and to protect the integrity of the Irish passport, the Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants</p>  <p>  - In the case of children, it is essential that the Passport Service verifies the consent of the child&rsquo;s guardians before a passport can issue. This ensures that the Passport Service protects the rights of the child and their guardians.</p>  <p>  - Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 40 working days to process. </p>  <p>  While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. Figures show that there are currently 76,000 (53%) applications that are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. There are also 67,000 applications (47%) in the system where the Passport Service is waiting for the customer to complete the application. In these cases, the onus is on the customer to submit the required documents to the Service. </p>  <p>  In the case of children's passports, recent Passport Service figures show that in the case of 77% of incomplete children's first time and renewal applications, parents have completed the online registration process but have not yet submitted the witnessed identity and consent form or important documents such as the child's birth certificate. In these cases, the Passport Service simply cannot move the application forward until the required documentation is received and the processing time will take longer. The Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances. However, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.</p>  <p>  The current turnaround time for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service is 8 weeks. Proposed turnaround times for 2022 aim to reduce this processing time. Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online Service is four times quicker than paper-based applications for adult and child renewal applications and is the fastest, easiest and safest way to apply for a passport. Over 90% of applicants now apply online compared to 47% of applications received online in 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022. The Passport Service is currently implementing a number of measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service including the allocation of additional staff, intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff and the prioritisation of first time applications. </p>  <p>  In addition, a new document management process is being put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. </p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p>  <p>  Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-09a.160.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020900066#WRE01500"><p>On an annual basis, the Defence Sector budget, comprising of Vote 35 (Army Pensions) and Vote 36 (Defence), is determined within the overarching budgetary framework and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, with multi-annual capital envelopes determined as part of the overarching National Development Plan.</p><p>The return of amounts to the Exchequer from the Defence Sector budget arises for two reasons. Appropriations in Aid are amounts received by the Department and include payments from the UN and other organisations. Government accounting rules require that any additional Appropriations in Aid received, above the estimate, must be surrendered to the Exchequer. In addition, any amount of the budget allocation not fully expended must also be surrendered.</p><p>Expenditure under the Army Pensions Vote is essentially demand-driven and non-discretionary. In any given year, it is very difficult to predict accurately the exact number of voluntary early retirements from the Defence Forces with entitlement to immediate payment of retirement benefits and as a result, there can be an underspend or a requirement for additional funding. Such additional funding is met through the Supplementary Estimate process. In 2018, an additional &euro;3.5 million was required and in 2019, an additional &euro;1.9 million was needed. These amounts were met from savings in the Defence Vote.</p><p>In relation to the Defence Vote, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, any savings arising in the Vote, when not utilised to meet requirements in the Army Pensions Vote, are normally reallocated to address spending pressures elsewhere in the Defence Vote.  However in 2021, similar to many other Public Service organisations, the impact of Covid-19 and supply chain difficulties limited the extent to which my Department was able to re-direct these savings.</p><p>The tables below show the Net Exchequer Surrender and its constituent elements, including the total underspend for both Votes.</p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Vote 35 Army Pensions</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Vote 35 Army Pensions </th>       <th>Net Exchequer Surrender (&euro;m)</th>       <th>Additional A-in-As Received (&euro;m)</th>       <th>Underspend (&euro;m)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>&euro;0.5</td>       <td>&euro;0.2</td>       <td>&euro;0.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;0.2</td>       <td>&euro;0.1</td>       <td>&euro;0.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;8.1</td>       <td>&euro;0 </td>       <td>&euro;8.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021* </td>       <td>&euro;2.7</td>       <td>&euro;0 </td>       <td>&euro;2.7</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*provisional figures</p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; Vote 36 Defence</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Vote 36 Defence </th>       <th>Net Exchequer Surrender (&euro;m)</th>       <th>Additional A-in-As Received (&euro;m)</th>       <th>Amount Reallocated for Vote 35 Supplementary Estimate (&euro;m)</th>       <th>Underspend (&euro;m)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>&euro;17.0</td>       <td>&euro;11.1</td>       <td>&euro;3.5</td>       <td>&euro;2.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;11.4</td>       <td>&euro;9.4</td>       <td>&euro;1.9</td>       <td>&euro;0.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;6.2</td>       <td>&euro;6.1</td>       <td>n/a</td>       <td>&euro;0.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021* </td>       <td>&euro;29.1</td>       <td>&euro;6.1</td>       <td>n/a</td>       <td>&euro;23.0 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*provisional figures</p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  There are 3,500 places available on the online programme over 4 years.  Each phase of the programme has been fully subscribed to date. 500 have completed the programme and a new cohort of 1,000 commenced the programme last September.</p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the entry requirements for SNAs. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.   My Department is prioritising the contract review and this will be followed by a review of the entry qualifications. </p>  <p>  II am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The SNA scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school based on the principle that those with the greatest needs receive the greatest level of support. Guidance is available to schools on the allocation of SNA support within the schools,   SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p>  <p>  Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year. Furthermore, provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year. Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website: www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education</p>  <p>  The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited in order to observe the current deployment of SNA support in the school setting.</p>  <p>  The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided. </p>  <p>  The NCSE have confirmed that following an application for a review the school visit took place on 29/11/2021 and that the outcome of the review will issue to the school shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. </p></reply>

The savings relate to reduced travel and subsistence costs, reduced venue hire and associated catering costs. </p><p>These overall CPD spend figures include expenditure on a range of leadership support programmes provided by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) for newly appointed principals, deputy principals and middle leaders. My Department also funds the Centre for School Leadership (CSL) established in 2015 which presents a unique opportunity for the development of a coherent continuum of professional development for school leaders.

My Department also supports the provision of professional learning through both IPPN and NAPD. </p><p>In addition to grant funding, my Department also funds the salary costs of just over 300 teachers seconded to work in the Teacher Education Support Services and local Education Centres.

Extensive supports, resources and advice for teachers and schools on the embedding of digital technologies  including advise on selection of individual devices and technical support are available through the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and its Technology in Education (PDST TiE) team at www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie/en/Technology/.</p>  <p>  Direct funding is provided to schools as they are best placed to determine the preferred approach for planning and embedding the use of digital technology in their school in accordance with their own particular context and requirements. The grant funding allocation can be used to provide devices for use by students and teachers, for learning platforms, software and overall digital technology infrastructure development in the school. To assist schools in this matter, the Department together with the Office of Government Procurement, have put in place single provider frameworks that meet technical and procurement requirements for schools for the provision of such devices, which include warranty supports of up to five years.</p>  <p>  Schools have autonomy in the expenditure of their ICT grant and while there is no specific ring-fenced allocation for the provision of technical support, schools can use their ICT funding for this purpose. Schools are also free to use their capitation allocation for the purpose of maintenance and upkeep of equipment including digital equipment. When purchasing equipment schools can also include maintenance and support from the provider as part of that purchase.</p>  <p>  The Schools Broadband programme provides internet connectivity and associated services including filtering to all recognised primary and post-primary schools, with at least 98% of schools availing this service. This programme is funded by the Department at an annual cost of some &euro;13m, with a dedicated Schools Broadband Service Desk for schools managed for the Department by the PDST TiE.</p>  <p>  A new Digital Strategy will be published shortly. This will build on the progress made under the previous strategy and continue to build capacity in schools to support teachers and learners to avail of the opportunities that the use of digital technologies in education can provide. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Digital Strategy for Schools is to ensure that our young people develop the skills they need to navigate effectively and safely in a digital world and transition successfully to further and higher education and to the world of work.</p></reply>

This spans the curriculum in schools, culture and environment, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development for teachers.   </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice which was first published in 2018 and refreshed in 2019 describes how schools can best promote wellbeing through the provision of a whole-school, multi-component and preventative approach.</p>  <p>  The approach in the Wellbeing Policy is founded on research and best international practice in relation to how schools can best support the wellbeing and mental health of children and young people.  The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include:</p>  <p>  -  Providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies</p>  <p>      -  Providing children and young people with opportunities to experience supportive relationships within the school setting and to learn through those relationships </p>  <p>  - Providing children and young people with opportunities to be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, an environment in which children and young people feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, in which they feel their voice is heard, and they feel supported.  </p>  <p>  - Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs. </p>  <p>  NEPS provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS recognise the importance of whole-school, compassionate and trauma-informed approaches in building safe and connected schools. </p>  <p>  NEPS provides a casework service to schools through the assigned NEPS psychologist, Individual casework service involves a high level of psychologist collaboration with teachers and parents, often also working directly with the child/young person.  NEPS may become involved with supporting individual students where the school&rsquo;s SET team or Student Support Team (in post-primary) feels that the involvement of the psychologist is needed. Psychologists may provide consultation in relation to therapeutic informed approaches to be delivered in the school setting and engage in direct work with an individual student as appropriate. In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist can identify the most appropriate referral pathway and supports school with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.</p>  <p>  NEPS&rsquo; Support and Development work involves the provision of applied psychology services for teachers and school communities to build and maximise their capacity to respond to the needs of all students and those with particular needs. This includes trauma informed education. </p>  <p>  As part of this support and development work NEPS has developed a series of Wellbeing and Resilience in schools webinars, exploring the use of whole-school, compassionate and trauma-informed approaches to build safe and connected schools. Part 1, is called &lsquo;The Stress factor - Getting the balance right&rsquo; a webinar for all school staff. This will be followed by a series of special interest modules using the Department&rsquo;s e- learning platform. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The focus of the workshops is on exploring and understanding the sources and impact of stress on children and young people including attachment, trauma and adverse experiences. The emphasis will be on creating environments to reduce stress and on developing skills all children and young people need to better manage in school. The training will also cover the influences of stress on school staff and how to best to manage this. It is intended that staff will find the content useful in supporting their own wellbeing. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings. The workshops are for all staff and all students including those with SEN or those children impacted by trauma and adverse experiences. NEPS psychologists will be available to support implementation in schools.</p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists have engaged in extensive national training in the area of trauma in recent years with Karen Treisman and Dr David Trickey to inform their practice and inform their development of CPD for school staff.  NEPS has been participating in the 5 Nations ACEs Network for a number of years. This Network includes delegates from government departments, public health bodies, social services and education from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the United Kingdom.</p></reply>

I also know that students had sought certainty and clarity regarding the approach to be taken in respect of this year&rsquo;s examinations. I hope that the measures I announced on 1 February, including further significant changes to examination papers, and confirmation that the overall set of Leaving Certificate results that the class of 2022 will attain will be at least the same level as the results attained by the class of 2021, will help address the concerns of students and provide the certainty and clarity sought by them.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks and in advance of my announcement of 1 February, I met with the Advisory Group on Planning for the State Examinations, which has representatives of students, parents, teachers, school managerial bodies, the further and higher education sector, and the State Examinations Commission. Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter.  I listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points.</p>  <p>  It was following this engagement, and after consideration of the matter by Government, that I announced the decision to operate an examinations approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022.</p>  <p>  The further significant changes to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, have just been communicated to schools. These changes will mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination.  </p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break.</p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been moved out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities they have regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework.</p>  <p>  Additionally, I have confirmed the waiving of the fees for the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations.</p>  <p>  As part of the adjustments for the 2022 examinations, an alternative set of Leaving Certificate examinations will be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations.  These  examinations will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID 19 illness and certain other categories of serious illness to be determined, with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, which govern all aspects of the examinations system.</p>  <p>  The most current information on all matters relating to the Leaving Certificate examinations is available on an ongoing basis at gov.ie - Leaving Certificate 2022 (www.gov.ie). This includes an updated set of wellbeing information and supports for students, parents/guardians and school staff, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) in my Department. In addition, NEPS, in collaboration with the Department of Health and the HSE, have collaborated to provide up-to-date information and links to supports available for Leaving Certificate students at this time in a Mental Health and Wellbeing Information Leaflet, copies of which have been sent to all post primary schools.</p>  <p>  Information regarding the examinations is also available from the State Examinations Commission at SEC Home - State Examination Commission (examinations.ie).</p></reply>

The continued availability of locally based Community Welfare Officers is a key feature of the service.   For this reason, consultations can be arranged via phone, at our Intreo Centres and Social Welfare Branch Offices which are open five days per week or, indeed, a direct home visit depending on the customer&rsquo;s need and public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, customers no longer have to meet in person with a Community Welfare Officer (CWO) to make a claim and access to Community Welfare Services is not limited to a face-to-face meeting with a CWO. </p>  <p>  To help our customers and support our CWOs where possible, the preparatory work on customer applications, for example the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim, will be carried out by a back office team.  However, the assessment and decision on claims and any further customer interactions or engagements with other agencies is then carried out by locally based Community Welfare Officers as it always has been.  There are no changes to the structure of the service by County.</p>  <p>  It is vital that the Community Welfare Service is easily accessible and responsive to customer needs and developing and enhancing access to the Service remains my priority.</p></reply>

I have been given Government approval to bring forward legislation on the basis of the agreed proposals for the Scheme and my officials are working on drafting a General Scheme of a Bill as a matter of a priority. As previously stated, I will seek priority drafting of the Bill when submitting the General Scheme to Government to ensure that the Bill can be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible thereafter, subject also to any pre-legislative scrutiny process which may take place. Once the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas and the administrative infrastructure required to deliver the Scheme has been established, the Scheme will be open for applications. I hope that this will be possible by the end of 2022.</p><p>The Deputy has asked about an interim payment scheme for older survivors.  My focus is on delivering the Scheme itself as quickly as possible. Once the Scheme is open for applications, it is intended that priority will be given to those who are elderly, and any other categories deemed appropriate for prioritisation.  As the design of the scheme is predicated on a single payment based on evidence of residency, it is not clear how any interim arrangement could be designed more quickly than the scheme itself.  This is because the same administrative infrastructure must be established to receive applications and make payments on this scale, regardless of whether this would be done by way of interim arrangement or through the scheme itself.  Similarly, a legislative basis is needed to govern access to records confirming residency and to provide for eligibility for an enhanced medical card, as well as to ensure that any payments received will be disregarded for the purposes of establishing social welfare entitlements or tax liabilities.  </p><p>The proposals for the Scheme are centred on a non-adversarial approach which will be as straightforward as possible for applicants. As the Deputy will be aware, it is intended that an Executive Office will be established in my Department to administer the Scheme. The staff of the Executive Office will be trained to support survivors in completing their applications. Applicants will also be entitled to financial support, subject to agreed limits, to avail of independent legal advice at the point of signing a waiver and should an affidavit be required to support their application.</p><p>In terms of eligibility, the Scheme will encompass the 14 Mother and Baby Institutions investigated by the Commission of Investigation and all County Home Institutions. The agreed proposals set out that a person will be eligible for a General Payment if they were either:</p><p>a) A pregnant or unmarried mother who was resident in a Mother and Baby or County Home Institution for any period of time, including when under 18 years of age at the time of being pregnant.</p><p>b) A person who was resident as a child in a Mother and Baby or County Home Institution for a period of six months or more (and who did not receive redress under the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme).</p><p>It is also important to note that the Government's comprehensive <i>Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions</i>will cater for the needs of all those who are affected by Ireland's complex legacy in this area. In particular, I would reiterate that the overwhelming priority need which has been expressed to me by people who, as children, were adopted or otherwise separated from their birth family, is access to records concerning their birth and early life information. Action 4 of the Action Plan provides for this through the Birth Information and Tracing Bill and the investment which has been made available to support implementation of this legislation, which has recently completed Second Stage in the Dail.</p><p>I trust this information in relation to the proposals for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme and the broader Action Plan is helpful. Further details concerning the Scheme and the Action Plan can be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/294f6-mother-and-baby-homes/. </p></reply>

Neither Minister McEntee nor I have a role in these independent functions. </p>  <p>  Minister McEntee is regularly kept appraised on matters under the Commissioner's remit by Commissioner Harris and his management team, including on matters related to violent crime.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB) last year. This forum is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at proposals for new ways forward, including whether new powers for Garda&iacute; and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders are needed. Members of the Forum, which I chair, include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Government Departments, community groups, business community members and NGOs. </p>  <p>  The Forum is examining a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counteract the negative impact of ASB on community morale and quality of life. This has included two subgroups established to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.</p>  <p>  The knife crime subgroup is assessing available evidence to inform policy on knife crime, with particular reference to effectiveness of proposals, to inform both legislation and community safety policies, programmes and practices. The work of this subgroup is ongoing and is expected to conclude in Q1 2022.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place in Ireland with respect to knife crime including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned. Indeed, the maximum penalty in the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years in an amendment introduced via the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</p>  <p>  Legislative responses alone will not provide a ready solution and evidence from other jurisdictions indicate that simply adopting harsher penalties will not lead to a reduction in the incidence of these crimes. Our existing five year sentence for knife possession is longer than in the UK, for example, where a four year penalty applies. It is important to note that there are no quick-fix solutions, based on international experience, and longer term, evidence-based strategies are needed.</p>  <p>  We will continue to examine all possible options as part of the work of the sub-group, including those undertaken in other jurisdictions, and do our utmost to ensure that our communities are, and feel, safe.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na run a number of proactive policing initiatives aimed at reducing assaults and improving feelings of community safety, including Operation Soteria (the national assault reduction strategy) and Operation Citizen in Dublin City Centre, which sees increased Garda visibility at peak times and focused on areas where ASB and violent crime incidents have arisen recently in the capital. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's 'Use Your Brain, Not Your Fists' campaign also highlights the impacts on both victim and perpetrator of an assault. </p>  <p>  I would therefore appeal to anyone who believes that carrying or using any form of weapon, be it a knife, or even a fist, to stop and think of the lasting damage and consequences of those decisions. Even if you believe that you are protecting yourself, the lasting impact of an assault is felt long after the blow is struck. </p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for treatment especially for time sensitive procedures. As Minister for Health, I am acutely aware of the impact this has on children and their families. Reducing paediatric waiting times remains a Ministerial priority and will be addressed as a key priority area in the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan. Officials in the Department of Health remain in regular contact with Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland in relation to developing plans to reduce waiting times, improve activity levels, and associated service planning.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p></reply>

The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are: </p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person </p>  <p>  - Bed and board </p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living </p>  <p>  - Laundry service</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers.</p></reply>

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients.</p>  <p>  Children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic service of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, for example children with Spina Bifida, hip deformity, and other orthopaedic needs. The complex patient needs of these children remains at the forefront of service provision.</p>  <p>  I remain acutely aware of the need to improve access to orthopaedic patients, particularly for those patients with acute medical needs.  On the 7th February 2022, I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss increased orthopaedic activity at CHI and additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures including Spina Bifida, by year end. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the HSE and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to deliver improved paediatric orthopaedic services. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively.</p>  <p>  More specifically, in order to tackle waiting lists for scoliosis, and orthopaedic paediatric surgery more broadly, an additional &euro;5 million has recently been committed to improve access, including through additional theatre and diagnostic capacity to be brought on stream this year.</p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland continue to examine new and innovative ways to improve access to orthopaedic services. &ldquo;Cappagh Kids&rdquo; at the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional theatre capacity for non-complex, age appropriate, orthopaedic procedures, freeing up much needed space at central CHI sites for children with complex, multi-disciplinary needs. Additional orthopaedic outpatient sessions are also now held at Cappagh, providing additional capacity to see and assess children on the outpatient waiting list.</p>  <p>  In addition, a new fast-track orthopaedic pathway has been developed as part of outpatient reduction plans. Paediatric Active Clinical Triage has already been introduced for the longest waiters (over 12 months) on the paediatric outpatient list.</p>  <p>  More broadly, improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The cost of providing a recognition payment of &euro;1,000 to all eligible public servants working in the health and ambulance services depends on the number of staff who are eligible for the payment. If there were 100,000 WTE deemed eligible, the estimated cost would be approximately &euro;100 million. This figure of 100,000 WTE represents approximately 75% of the HSE/Section 38 workforce and would be the minimum expected to be eligible for this recognition payment.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, the cost of providing an equivalent recognition payment to relevant staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19 depends on the number of staff deemed eligible for the payment. The estimated cost set out above does not include the cost in respect of nursing homes and Defence Forces staff. This measure, including costings, will be progressed by the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The cost of providing a recognition payment of &euro;1,000 to all eligible public servants working in the health and ambulance services depends on the number of staff who are eligible for the payment. If there were 100,000 WTE deemed eligible, the estimated cost would be approximately &euro;100 million. This figure of 100,000 WTE represents approximately 75% of the HSE/Section 38 workforce and would be the minimum expected to be eligible for this recognition payment.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, the cost of providing an equivalent recognition payment to relevant staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19 depends on the number of staff deemed eligible for the payment. The estimated cost set out above does not include the cost in respect of nursing homes and Defence Forces staff. This measure will exclude all private sector health workers except those working in nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19.  This measure, including costings, will be progressed by the Department of Health. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services but did not work in such exposed areas. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which frontline healthcare workers faced.</p></reply>

Booster certificates began issuing from the 6th of January 2022 and this saw a huge increase in demand on the service centre. </p>  <p>  Prior to the issuance of booster certificates, the Service Centre was receiving between 500 and 600 calls per day. This figure rose to a peak demand of around 4,500 calls and around 2,000 chats per day in mid-January. The increased demand and the average wait time being experienced by callers resulted in extra agents being trained and added to the service centre, increasing the number of agents from 38 to 56. Additional resources were also added to the HSE data quality team to support the resolution of complex cases. </p>  <p>  Since the end of January, call demand and wait times have decreased with approximately 2,000 calls per day and 1,800 chats at present and an average of between 50 minutes and 1 hour and 10 minutes wait time.  Other service channels outside of calls are also open to persons seeking assistance including a self-service portal and Live Chat. </p>  <p>  Given that the bulk of booster certificates have now been issued by email and post and that there is no longer a requirement to use the EU Digital Covid Certificate for domestic purposes, it is anticipated that wait times will be further reduced. </p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The cost of providing a recognition payment of &euro;1,000 to all eligible public servants working in the health and ambulance services depends on the number of staff who are eligible for the payment. If there were 100,000 WTE deemed eligible, the estimated cost would be approximately &euro;100 million. This figure of 100,000 WTE represents approximately 75% of the HSE/Section 38 workforce and would be the minimum expected to be eligible for this recognition payment.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, the cost of providing an equivalent recognition payment to relevant staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19 depends on the number of staff deemed eligible for the payment. The estimated cost set out above does not include the cost in respect of nursing homes and Defence Forces staff. This measure, including costings, will be progressed by the Department of Health. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services but did not work in such exposed areas. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which frontline healthcare workers faced.</p></reply>

There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of ex-gratia monthly payments from the Department of Health.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump-sum and monthly payments for life, the supports provided by the Irish State to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, which includes access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment and housing adaptations.  There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive who liaises with Irish thalidomide survivors and assists them to access supports towards their ongoing health and personal social service needs.</p>  <p>  Work is underway in the Department to bring forward Heads of a Bill to provide these health and personal social supports on a statutory basis to Irish thalidomide survivors. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the German Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013 it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.</p></reply>

In line with the &lsquo;mainstream first&rsquo; approach of the Disability Act 2005, over 90% of people with a disability are supported through general community health and social services.  Health Service Executive funded specialist community-based disability services are delivered to about 56,000 people or 9% of those with a disability. Policy functions and funding responsibility relating to specialist community-based disability services will transfer to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the responsibility for the delivery of these services will be retained within the Health Service Executive. The changed arrangements will not affect access to and delivery of specialist disability services on the ground. However, the assignment of policy and funding responsibility for disability services will enable a particular Ministerial focus on this area, in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, for which the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth co-ordinates the national response. </p><p>Specialist community-based disability services include the services provided by, or on behalf of, the HSE to children and adults with physical, sensory, intellectual disability and/or autism, including: </p><p>- Specialist children&rsquo;s and adults&rsquo; multi-disciplinary supports </p><p>- Day services </p><p>- Respite services </p><p>- Personal Assistant and Home Support Services and</p><p>- Residential services </p><p>Mental health services are remaining under the auspices of my Department. </p><p>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be published shortly. The transfer of functions will be provided for by way of secondary legislation under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939, and statutory instruments have been drafted to effect the transfer. The Bill is a technical Bill assigning appropriate governance and oversight powers to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of the policy areas transferring. </p><p>Where practicable and appropriate, under the Disability Act 2005 (Section 26) persons with a disability will continue to access mainstream services such as GP, dental services and acute hospital services, while people with complex needs who so require will continue to be supported through specialist community-based disability supports and services. Policy and political responsibility for mainstream health services (including those delivered to people with disabilities) and for mental health services, will continue to lie with my Department.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. </p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to make specific provision for Crohn&rsquo;s disease under any new or existing health scheme. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, is to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs. </p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;100 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. </p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

It is also available in single ingredient, non-prescription products, as a cough suppressant. These authorised products are available without a prescription through retail pharmacy businesses (pharmacies) only.</p>  <p>  The Pharmacy Act 2007 and the Regulation of Retail Pharmacy Businesses Regulations 2008 require that all medicines supplied through a pharmacy must be supplied by or under the personal supervision of a pharmacist and that all non-prescription medicines supplied must be the subject of appropriate counselling.</p>  <p>  The pharmacy regulator, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), issued guidance to pharmacists in 2010 on the safe supply of non-prescription products containing codeine. This guidance was updated in 2015, 2017 and most recently in October 2019. The Guidance covers the requirements set out above and, in addition, contains further restrictions which apply to the supply of codeine-based products. </p>  <p>  These restrictions include a requirement that codeine-based products are not available to the public for self-selection and should only be supplied when a pharmacist deems such a supply to be necessary and only when a non-opioid analgesic, e.g. paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen, has not proven sufficient to relieve the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. The guidance also states that codeine medicines should be used for the shortest time possible and for no longer than three days without medical supervision. Pharmacists must also ensure that patients are advised of the importance of adhering to the recommended dosage and duration of use, as well as the risks associated with overdose and/or prolonged use. Patients should also be counselled in respect of potential adverse reactions or side effects.</p>  <p>The full guidance document, along with information on current legislative requirements, is available on the PSI website: thepsi.ie/Libraries/Folder_Pharmacy_Practice_Guidance/01_3_Safe_supply_of_Codeine_to_patients.sflb.ashx.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended.  </p>  <p>  The cost of providing a recognition payment of &euro;1,000 to all eligible public servants working in the health and ambulance services depends on the number of staff who are eligible for the payment. If there were 100,000 WTE deemed eligible, the estimated cost would be approximately &euro;100 million. This figure of 100,000 WTE represents approximately 75% of the HSE/Section 38 workforce and would be the minimum expected to be eligible for this recognition payment.  </p>  <p>  Similarly, the cost of providing an equivalent recognition payment to relevant staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19 depends on the number of staff deemed eligible for the payment. The estimated cost set out above does not include the cost in respect of nursing homes and Defence Forces staff. This measure will exclude all private sector health workers except those working in nursing homes and hospices affected by Covid-19.  This measure, including costings, will be progressed by the Department of Health. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining our health service but did not work in such exposed areas. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which frontline healthcare workers faced.</p>  <p>  Finally I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter however you will understand that the Department of Health cannot comment on individual cases.</p></reply>

For this reason, the legislation will make provision for a scheme of compensation, that is fair and reasonable, to be made available to the three farm businesses affected by the prohibition.   </p>  <p>  The compensation scheme being brought forward will see that these businesses be paid for income losses, non-income losses and costs incurred as a direct result of the ban.  </p>  <p>  The regulations being prepared at the moment will specify and set out the framework for compensation regarding the income and non-income losses and other costs and provide the basis of valuation.  They will also provide detail on compensation for costs involved in disposing of breeding mink, demolition and clean-up costs, payments to redundant workers, and professional fees for professionals used in the process. </p>  <p>  A copy of the draft regulations containing this detail will be made available to the farmers and their representatives in the near future.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to ensure that the ban on Mink Farming is progressed in a fair and equitable manner with consideration being given to the concerns of all parties involved. </p></reply>

The existing Council sets its own priorities and has a number of working groups which provide advice on a wide range of areas including climate change, forest genetics resources, ecosystem services and timber forecasting.</p>  <p>  The COFORD Wood Mobilisation and Wood Forecasting Group during this Council term was tasked with projecting timber production from 2021 out to 2040. This forecast is now complete which projects that the annual potential roundwood supply will increase from 4.5 million cubic metres in 2022 to over 6 million cubic metres in 2030. This is a significant increase in timber production and will provide many opportunities for forest owners in the sale of timber.  </p>  <p>  The Central Statistic Office has started collecting information on the amount of wood harvested and removed from Irish forest and published figures for the first time in 2021. They will continue to collect statistics in relation timber harvested and will publish annual returns. </p>  <p>  My Department and the COFORD Council working group will monitor closely the potential volume of timber forecasted and compare it to the volume of timber actually removed from Irish forests. This tracking is important to ensure that the licences issued are at the required level to ensure timber is harvested in line with the forecast. The CSO estimated that in 2020 there were approximately 3.91 million cubic metres of timber removed from Irish forests which matches the COFORD projected forecast for the same year. Figures are not yet available for 2021. This demonstrates that timber is being harvested at a sustainable rate nationally. My Department will continue to track volumes removed against the projected forecast which is important for forest owners and the forest industry.</p></reply>
