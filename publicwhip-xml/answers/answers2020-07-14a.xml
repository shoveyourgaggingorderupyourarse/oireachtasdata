    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-14a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400065#WRA00800"><p>There has been a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in County Waterford in recent years. Since 2012, employment at overseas companies in Waterford has risen by 40%, with over 120 net new jobs created in 2019. There are now over 7,000 people employed across 36 IDA client companies in the County. I am determined, together with IDA Ireland, to increase these numbers further as best we can. </p>  <p>  An important strength for Waterford is its hard-earned reputation as a successful home to firms from the MedTech and Pharmaceuticals sectors. Companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi and EirGen Pharma are all located there and continue to perform well. There have also been promising new investments in the County in the last 12 months &ndash; from companies such as the Emerald Contact Centre and The Agora Companies &ndash; which reflect Waterford&rsquo;s wider potential across other FDI areas. This increasing diversity of profile of overseas companies there bodes well for future investment and reflects the potential of the County. </p>  <p>  County Waterford hosted 18 site visits in 2019 and 21 site visits in 2018. There have been three site visits to Waterford as of the first quarter of this year. Information is not available on the number of visits to Waterford City as the IDA compiles such data on a county-by-county basis only.</p>  <p>  The reduced number of site visits in 2020, as the Deputy will appreciate, is mainly attributable to the introduction of international travel restrictions related to Covid-19. Those restrictions have, amongst other things, led to the cancellation or postponement of scheduled IDA site visits and client meetings in every region of the country, including Waterford and the South-East. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the difficulties presented by the pandemic, site visits do remain an important means by which the IDA can showcase regional locations &ndash; including Waterford &ndash; to prospective investors. At the same time, we must recognise that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the overseas company concerned. It is also the case, no matter what efforts we make to underline the undoubted benefits of regional locations, that certain firms will only consider investing in large urban areas for various commercial or operational reasons. </p>  <p>  More broadly, it&rsquo;s clear the FDI will have an important role to play &ndash; both in Waterford and across Ireland &ndash; as we seek to recover from the damage caused by Covid-19. Ireland remains highly attractive to international investors and we need to continue securing new FDI projects that can create jobs and stimulate other economic activity. The IDA&rsquo;s positive mid-year results, which I announced last week, reflect the resilience of the FDI base here and I will be doing everything I can to support its further growth and development, including in the South-East. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-14a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400065#WRA01400"><p>My understanding is that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates primarily to the regulations in place for the hospitality sector and licensed premises with regard to the re-opening of those businesses.  These regulations are not within the remit of my Department but are, mainly, within the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport with most regulation of licensed premises resting with the Department of Justice.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy is also enquiring about the giving of refunds for flights and package holidays.  While legislation on these matters also falls within the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, I can provide the Deputy with the following information.</p>  <p>  In relation to airline refunds the legal position is that air passenger rights are protected by Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, which covers the rights of passenger in instances of cancellations.  However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under this EU law.  That said, I understand that the main Irish airlines are currently allowing customers who are booked to travel over the summer months to move their flights with zero change fee.  Where flights are cancelled by the airlines, people are entitled to a full cash refund.   </p>  <p>  Similarly, the Package Travel market is regulated at EU level &ndash; the Package Travel Directive provides important consumer protections including the right to cancel a package holiday and receive a refund. The COVID-19 crisis has severely disrupted the travel plans of many, with many opting to follow Government advice not to undertake non-essential travel. As a result, Irish licensed tour operators and travel agents have seen an unprecedented demand for refund of package holidays - the Directive obligates them to refund even if flights go ahead. </p>  <p>  Clearly the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions across the globe.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport has approved regulations to provide a State-guarantee for credit notes issued by Irish-licensed travel agents and tour operators, known as Refund Credit Notes. Where a customer agrees to accept a Refund Credit Note instead of cash, the cash value of the refund credit note is guaranteed, until such time as the customer decides to cash it or use it against a rebooked holiday. This will help support viable, Irish businesses through these unprecedented times.  </p>  <p>  My colleague Eamonn Ryan, Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and Transport, is also aware that the options put forward by airlines may not be fair or workable for customers in all instances, and he will be raising this with the industry at the first available opportunity.</p></reply>

I understand that there is no pending priority legislation in the area of employment rights at this time.</p>  <p>  I am concerned that there appears to be a mistaken belief out there that migrant workers &ndash; and by this term I mean workers who are from outside the European Economic Area who rely on employment permits to access the Irish Labour market &ndash; are somehow outside the protections that the State guarantees for all workers. Irish employment law does not discriminate. All workers in Ireland are entitled to refer employment rights complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Migrant workers enjoy the same protections under the Payment of Wages Act, Organisation of Working Time Act, Employment Equality Acts, and so on, as any Irish worker. </p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission provides information booklets on employment rights in 15 languages, including Irish. These are available on the WRC's website. </p>  <p>  I have clarified my position concerning the Sectoral Employment Orders already today. We will appeal the High Court decision. I am committed to the sectoral employment orders and will be taking any action necessary to ensure stability in the sectors concerned. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-14a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400065#WRA02000"><p>As the Deputy will know, many of the sectors referred to in the question relate to policy responsibilities of other Ministers but I am happy to outline my position on how best to assist enterprises in the current circumstances and into the future.</p><p>Firstly, I would remind the Deputy that much has already been done. Some of the supports already available include:</p><p>- the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme - under which the Government has invested almost &euro;2 billion in supporting the maintenance of employment across the enterprise sector;</p><p>- the &euro;250 million Restart Fund to help small businesses to reopen their doors and get back on their feet; </p><p>- a &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund which is making capital available to medium and large enterprises;</p><p>- the 'warehousing' of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue; </p><p>- relief on rates for three months for businesses that were closed;</p><p>- a &euro;450m Working Capital scheme from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI); and</p><p>- an additional &euro;200m Future Growth Loan Scheme (SBCI) to be released in tranches, providing longer-term loans to COVID-19 impacted businesses.</p><p>The full list of the business supports is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>My Department has developed a range of proposals which I have brought to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment for consideration. These proposals, along with others from Ministerial colleagues, will be developed further for the Government&rsquo;s consideration of an ambitious stimulus package which will be announced soon.</p><p>There are some welcome signs of improvement in business activity and the economy. However, sectors that employ a lot of people, such as tourism and hospitality, arts and entertainment and other services that rely on social interaction, remain in serious difficulty and their recovery prospects are highly uncertain.  While we can&rsquo;t keep every firm and job alive, our emphasis is to protect jobs insofar as we can.</p><p>It would be inappropriate to set out now the details of the proposals, but I can assure the Deputy that the Government will not be found wanting. Not only must we overcome the current challenges but we must also look ahead.</p><p>The July stimulus package to be announced shortly, will be radical, of scale and far-reaching. In considering the analyses, I see five areas in which we should focus on in helping our enterprises in the future.</p><p>1. Income supports for workers</p><p>2. Direct grants for businesses</p><p>3. Cheaper finance</p><p>4. New opportunities for future jobs</p><p>5. Support for the hardest hit sectors  </p><p>The July Stimulus needs to help firms meet the fixed, non-wage costs incurred during lockdown and in re-opening.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-14a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400066#WRB00400"><p>The new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme announced by Government forms a major component of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times.  It will provide critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment.  </p>  <p>  It is a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme and will initially be available through the current finance providers Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Scheme will provide an 80% State guarantee on lending until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years and will offer a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million including working capital and term loan facilities.  </p>  <p>  The key feature of the Scheme is that it will ensure the availability of liquidity to businesses by leveraging the strong relationship between banks and their customers all over the country.</p>  <p>  There are a number of steps  which need to be completed in relation to the Scheme, however, it is likely that the new Credit Guarantee Scheme will be available in September/October.  It will commence second stage debate in the Dail next week. </p>  <p>  The implementation of this Scheme requires amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 and following approval to publish the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020, the legislation will be considered by the Oireachtas in the coming week.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the legislative requirements, this ambitious COVID-19 CGS requires important engagement with the European Commission and the participating finance providers. </p>  <p>  The new Scheme will take advantage of the relaxation of State Aid rules under the European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary Framework which has provided the opportunity to widen the base of the current Credit Guarantee Scheme to now include primary producers.  My officials are currently engaged with the European Commission in seeking approval and ensuring the Scheme's adherence to the rules set out in its Temporary Framework.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and from the Department of Finance and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine along with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland are engaging with finance providers in relation to the specific terms and conditions of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  This engagement provides the opportunity to develop the Scheme with provisions that help its effective and efficient roll-out.  As the State is providing a significant support to banks to provide credit facilities to companies, it is expected that the banks will apply interest rates below current market rates.  It should also be noted that as required by the Temporary Framework, a premium will be charged in recognition of the State backed guarantee.   </p>  <p>  I expect  the participating finance providers to implement this Scheme in an efficient and effective manner to ensure that this badly needed finance is quickly made available to businesses.  </p></reply>

Therefore, helping our SMEs is central to my role as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware the Local Enterprise Offices operate in every county in Ireland including border counties and provide advice, information and support to businesses in starting up or growing their business.   </p>  <p>  The full range of Local Enterprise Office advisory supports continue to be available throughout the regions to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Border Enterprise Development Fund (BEDF) which was launched in January, and is administered by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of my Department provides support for collaborative, enterprise capability building projects, to advance entrepreneurship, productivity and innovation in the Border Region. The aim of the fund is to improve the international competitiveness of enterprise in the Border Region in the context of Brexit and other market challenges, which now also include COVID-19.  The Fund is part of a &euro;28 million economic stimulus package announced earlier this year for the six border counties of Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  </p>  <p>  On 22 June last, the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, named the 11 successful border county projects from the North East and North West of the country approved to share in the &euro;17m Border Enterprise Development Fund 2020, an initiative administered for my Department by Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  Nineteen applications were received from project groups in Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth with 11 projects selected for funding following a rigorous evaluation process. Four of the finalist projects will be based in Louth, two in Monaghan, two in Donegal, one in Cavan, one in Sligo and one in Leitrim.</p>  <p>  The successful projects are closely aligned with the Strategic Objectives for enterprise development set out in the Regional Enterprise Plans for the North-East and the North West, particularly in relation to strengthening SME resilience and innovation, growing entrepreneurship, and creating quality jobs across the Border region.</p>  <p>  Guided by the Regional Enterprise Plans, the border region is well positioned to continue to see the benefits and results of collaborative and innovative initiatives that can make a significant impact on enterprise development in the region. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are continuing their important work in assisting businesses in the region to sustain and grow employment and also in winning new investments for the border counties. </p>  <p>  In addition and as stated in the Programme for Government, we will bring forward a July Stimulus to support our economy and help restore employment. Our focus is to support the viability of the business and enterprise sector and to get people back to work as quickly as possible in all sectors and in all regions. </p>  <p>  While I have emphasised the importance of preserving existing firms and jobs, the July Stimulus package should also have an eye to exploiting emerging opportunities and attract high value projects with significant economic benefits. Importantly, the July Initiative must position our economy and firms in all our regions to meet future challenges. In the near-term, this includes helping companies further in overcoming the challenges of Brexit but we also need to include measures that build enterprise resilience.

Under the Companies Act 2014, I have no power to intervene in a court-supervised liquidation.</p>  <p>  The Duffy-Cahill report found in overall terms that &ldquo;the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 that are already available do not appear to be in need of amendment, but more in need of use.&rdquo;  A range of factors will be involved for liquidators or creditors in deciding whether to pursue litigation based on the provisions of the Companies Act 2014. Such statutory provisions and associated civil and criminal penalties also provide an important deterrent effect in terms of companies complying with their obligations under the Companies Act 2014.</p>  <p>  In 2017, in parallel with the Duffy-Cahill report, the Company Law Review Group undertook a root and branch review of the Companies Act to address concerns raised in respect of the protection of employees and unsecured creditors. The report which emanated from this review by the Company Law Review Group, also generally found that the current provisions of the Companies Act 2014 provide a comprehensive framework which strikes a balance between the interests of members of a company and other stakeholders, including employees.</p>  <p>  The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including official notification to the relevant Minister and a 30 day consultation period to allow employee representatives adequate opportunity to consider the employer&rsquo;s proposals and to make constructive proposals in response.  While responsibility for this legislation currently rests with my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, it will shortly transfer to my Department under a wider transfer of functions Order.</p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an office under the aegis of my Department which is available to any interested parties who may require it.

Pursuant to the Standing Orders of both Houses of the Oireachtas it will be for the Oireachtas to restore the Bill to the Order Paper.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed in the Programme for Government to review whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies effectively protect the rights of workers, and I intend to ensure that this is progressed in a timely manner.</p></reply>

When I become aware of serious issues of concern, I may invoke the powers under Section 10(4) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 to request that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) conducts relevant studies or analysis relating to consumer protection and welfare, reviews any practice or method on competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services, or any other matter relating to competition. </p><p>Since 2014, three requests have been made under Section 10(4) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 to the CCPC. The requests concern:</p><p><b>1. Options for Ireland&rsquo;s Mortgage Market</b></p><p>In June 2017, the CCPC published &lsquo;Options for Ireland&rsquo;s mortgage market&rsquo;, which reviewed how best to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and improve competition and consumer protection in the market.  The CCPC set out thirteen options for Government to address barriers to entry to the Irish market. The options were split into short, medium, and long term measures and focused on restoring trust in the banking sector, consumer switching and business friendly initiatives to attract entry into the market. The report was submitted to the Minister of Finance who had requested the study. The consideration and implementation of the options with the relevant Departments and Agencies is a matter for the Department of Finance. </p><p><b>2. The Operations of Ireland&rsquo;s Waste Collection Market</b></p><p>In September 2018, the CCPC published &lsquo;The Operation of the Household Waste Collection Market&rsquo; study, which was the first in-depth analysis of this market from a competition and consumer protection perspective. The CCPC reviewed the current structure and the evolution of the waste collection market, the economic theory behind utility markets and compared Ireland&rsquo;s market to those of other European countries. The CCPC identified a range of issues on the operation of the market and the CCPC&rsquo;s findings indicated that the market was moving towards a service provision model of unregulated monopoly operators, where the State in most cases did not have any means of incentivising or controlling the market. The report was submitted to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, who had requested the study.  It is my understanding that the recommendations are under consideration as part of the development of a new Waste Action Plan for Ireland.</p><p><b>3. The Operation of the Public Liability Insurance Market</b></p><p>On 15 August 2019, the former Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation requested that the CCPC examine how the public liability insurance market operates, how competition works in that market and whether any practice or method of competition affects the pricing levels of public liability insurance within that market. To fulfil the request, the CCPC has reported that it is currently completing an exercise that includes the following actions:</p><p>- A review of current issues and recent studies in the sector, including the reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and the Personal Injuries Commission.</p><p>- An overview of how the market operates and how public liability insurance is procured, including the extent to which insurance is intermediated by brokers or purchased directly from insurers.</p><p>- An analysis of the market structure and levels of competition.</p><p>- Determinants of costs, premia and profitability in the market.</p><p>- An assessment of barriers to entry and exit.</p><p>- A review of similar markets and studies internationally.</p><p>To develop the study, the CCPC is undertaking a wide range of activities where the majority are nearing completion:</p><p>Holding meetings with representative groups, public bodies, industry representatives and customers.</p><p>Conducting customer focussed market research among a representative sample of businesses, community groups and sports organisations.</p><p>Issuing a public consultation paper to obtain the views of key stakeholders.</p><p>Analysing data that is available on the market.</p><p>Undertaking desk-based research.</p><p>The CCPC is currently reviewing the type and range of information obtained to date to ensure that any potential issues that could impact on the level of competition in this market are identified. This will also help inform any potential recommendations which will be developed in the final stage of the study.  The CCPC is working to conclude the study as efficiently as possible as a key priority for the organisation.</p></reply>

Not only must we overcome the current challenges, but we must also look ahead and set our economy on the right course for the future.</p>  <p>  Already there are some welcome signs of improvement in business activity and the economy. However, sectors that employ a lot of people, such as tourism and hospitality, arts and entertainment and other services that rely on social interaction, continue to be in serious difficulty and their recovery prospects are highly uncertain. The emphasis of Government is to preserve as many jobs as possible within those sectors, and to enable new jobs to be created elsewhere within the economy.    </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also indicates that enabling our SMEs to return to capacity where possible and more broadly to strengthen SME resilience, productivity and innovation will be an important focus for the National Economic Plan. Increasing investment in RD&amp;I and promoting strong links between enterprise and the research community will assist in ensuring that Ireland keeps its relative advantage in technological adoption, increases the development of the green economy and assist in maximising our economic recovery.</p>  <p>  The Future Jobs Ireland framework will also be updated in light of the crisis and new priorities. The importance of RD&amp;I, and how we can drive developments in this area, was woven through the pillars of Future Jobs Ireland 2019, in particular Pillars 1 (Embracing Innovation and Technological Change), 2 (Improving SME Productivity), and 3 (Enhancing Skills and Developing and Attracting Talent) and must continue to be an integral part of the Future Jobs Ireland agenda. </p></reply>

The REDF, which is administered by Enterprise Ireland, has been an effective instrument of policy particularly as a complement to my Department's Regional Enterprise Plans where it has served as an enabler for projects emerging from that regional collaborative process.  There have been three calls under the Fund to date and just over &euro;100 million in funding has been approved across 68 projects, with projects approved in every region.</p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the first two Calls under the REDF, in March 2019, my officials and officials from Enterprise Ireland reviewed the format and process of the Scheme and this informed some technical changes to the subsequent Third Call in June 2019; for example a reduction of the number of streams from four to three, as well as associated adjustments to the funding ranges.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has not carried out an ex-post review of the Scheme as yet, owing to the fact that projects funded are currently in the various stages of implementation.

We are developing the July stimulus which will be ambitious and radical in deepening and widening the impact of the range of measures we have in place.  </p><p><b>Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme</b></p><p>The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI through participating finance providers. It makes available a fund of up to &euro;200 million in lending to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the impacts of the pandemic. Work is under way on a significant expansion to the scheme which will be brought to the market in the coming weeks.</p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) negatively impacted by Covid-19. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m and are for periods of up to three years. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured.</p><p><b>MFI Loan</b></p><p>The Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis.These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. Interest rates of between 4.5% and 5.5% are available.  Funding of &euro;15.65 million has been made available to MFI since March.</p><p><b>Credit Guarantee Scheme</b></p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme is available to Covid-19 impacted businesses, it supports loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years.  The Scheme offers a partial Government guarantee (currently 80%) to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  The scheme is designed to support a range of debt products appropriate to the borrowing needs of SMEs. Term loans and other products such stocking facilities, performance bonds will be covered by the Scheme.  There is no direct funding provided to the Scheme.  The Scheme give rise to a contingent liability with payments made on individual claims under the Scheme.</p><p><b>Business Continuity Support (IDA Ireland): </b>An initial application for &euro;2,500 support for training or advisory services related to the continued operation or re-start of businesses during the current pandemic. Further support can be applied for up to a maximum of &euro;29,700. This support is open to small, medium or large client companies of IDA Ireland.  </p><p><b>The Restart Grant</b>was launched on 22 May 2020 and is a critically important tool to support small businesses to reopen their doors and get back on their feet with supports of a minimum of &euro;2,000 up to &euro;10,000 available. The scheme was devised in recognition of the fact that micro and small businesses were and are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of Covid-19. </p><p>Using funding allocated by Enterprise Ireland for the Scheme, the Local Authorities are the granting authority in each of their respective areas in accordance with the criteria for the Scheme and the Local Authorities make grant payments to the bank account of qualifying businesses, in accordance with the scheme. The grants are available through the Local Authorities using a simple online application form. </p><p>The Restart Grant is just one part of a wider assistance package for business and for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs.  Within the funding available so far, the priority has been to assist those who have suffered most, including closure of the business, but whom will still have incurred ongoing costs.</p><p><b>Enterprise Ireland</b>is working with client companies to support the stabilisation of their business so that they can undertake a developmental programme focused on recovery and growth. To support companies the agency has: </p><p>- Developed and launched a suite of new funding supports utilising the additional flexibility permitted under Ireland&rsquo;s Sustaining Enterprise Scheme supporting undertakings affected by the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 outbreak under the Temporary Framework for State Aid Measure to Support the Economy in the Current COVID-19 Outbreak. </p><p>- Set up a Business Response Hub to provide information to companies on what supports are available to assist with their specific needs. To date the agency has supported 4,800 companies through the Hub. </p><p>As a first step, companies need to stabilise their business, with the two key elements of this being business planning and accessing liquidity.  To assist companies with this, the following COVID-19 supports have been introduced: </p><p><b>Lean Business Continuity Support:</b>This &euro;2.5k grant supports companies to access training or advisory services related to crisis management, sustaining operations, moving to e-business/online and planning for resilience post crisis. </p><p>Reflecting the practical and immediate nature of this support, company interest and demand has been strong.</p><p><b>COVID-19 Business Financial Planning Grant:</b>This grant of up to &euro;5k provides 100 per cent funding for companies to access a financial consultant to prepare a financial plan to assist companies: </p><p>- understand their immediate financial position, secure the finance required to survive and provide a framework to sustain the business; and </p><p>- ensure they have a framework to identify and manage costs and gaps in funding. </p><p>This is a critical support for a company to strengthen their position to identify funding needs and access required funding to implement their business plan. Since its launch in April, 669 applications for funding have been received by the agency. Currently 608 have been approved.  </p><p>Once a company has a financial and business continuity plan, Enterprise Ireland can provide funding for companies who have been impacted by COVID- 19, either through a reduction in turnover/profit or a significant increase in costs. The purpose of this funding is to enable the company to firstly, stabilise, and then, to implement a business sustainment plan, leading to a return to viability and contributing to the recovery of the Irish economy. The agency&rsquo;s liquidity and medium-term financial supports are being delivered under the <b>Sustaining Enterprise Fund</b>. Support of up to &euro;800,000 can be provided to companies, with different levels of support and funding instruments available, which are targeted at companies at different stages of development and growth (e.g. established companies, start-ups and small enterprises).</p><p><b>Supporting Retailers impacted by COVID-19:</b>Enterprise Ireland launched a COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme in April to assist retailers to enhance their online capability and to develop a more competitive online offer. On 2<sup>nd</sup>July 2020 I announced that 183 retailers had been approved for &euro;6.5m in funding as part of the scheme. The value of the scheme, which received 373 applications, was increased from &euro;2m to &euro;6.5m due to the high level of demand amongst retailers and the high quality of the proposals received.</p><p><b>The Business Continuity Voucher scheme</b>was launched on 26th March and was closed for new applications on 15th May.  It was designed for businesses across every sector that employ up to 50 people. The voucher, worth up to &euro;2,500 in third party consultancy costs, was used by companies and sole traders to develop short-term and long-term strategies to respond to the initial Covid-19 pandemic and to plan for the eventual recovery and reopening of the economy.</p><p><b>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme</b>was originally launched nationally by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in mid-2014. The Scheme offers financial assistance in the form of a Voucher of up to &euro;2,500 in order to procure expert consultancy advice on trading on-line including website management and is delivered along with training and advice to help business trade online. </p><p><b>E-Merge (IntertradeIreland)</b></p><p>The E-Merge programme provides consultancy support to assist companies develop online sales and eCommerce solutions to the value of &pound;2,500/&euro;2800. The scheme is open to cross-border enterprises, registered on the island of Ireland, and is involved in manufacturing or tradable services (other conditions also apply).

While no decision has yet been taken, I am informed that this review could lead to redundancies later this year. IDA Ireland are in close contact with the firm and are working to try avert, if possible, any potential job losses.   </p>  <p>  The uncertainty the situation has created is obviously an unwelcome development for the staff at the company and the region. My primary concern is for the workers and families who could be directly affected, many of whom have worked with the company for many years. In the regrettable event that redundancies do result, the Government will make every State support available to those impacted in order to help them transition and find new employment opportunities. </p>  <p>  I am asking the West Regional Enterprise Committee, on which the key agencies and local authorities are represented, to consider all scenarios in relation to this company. </p>  <p>  The situation at the company is particularly unfortunate given the wider economic difficulties that have been presented by COVID-19. My focus, since I became T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been on supporting businesses and protecting jobs. We have also been working hard on the forthcoming Jobs Stimulus Package, which will include far-reaching measures to set us on the right course for the next five years and beyond. Our aim is to create new employment opportunities all over the country, including in County Galway.  </p>  <p>  My Department and its Agencies have also been working hard, over a sustained period, to support job creation in the regions. This has included setting ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country. Last year, there were over 21,000 people employed in IDA-supported firms in Galway. This is almost double the number employed in 2010 (11,235). While the period ahead may prove more challenging, an important objective will remain securing new foreign direct investment for the County. </p>  <p>  Wider enterprise efforts are also underway to generate new growth in Galway and the surrounding area. For example, regional stakeholders &ndash; including Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and the Higher and Further Education Institutes &ndash; are working together on implementation of the Regional Enterprise Plan for the West. This is aimed at strengthening the environment for job creation in the region and Ballinasloe will also benefit from this. </p>  <p>  Another important initiative in this context is the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, through which over &euro;16.7m in funding for the West &ndash; over three competitive calls &ndash; has been approved for collaborative regional enterprise projects. The region has had particular recent success, with five Galway-based projects being awarded a total of &euro;9.6m. These projects are currently being developed and their completion will enhance the attractiveness of the area for further investment and job creation.</p></reply>

Grant payments available range from a minimum of &euro;2,000 up to &euro;10,000 available. The scheme was devised in recognition of the fact that micro and small businesses were and are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Using funding allocated by my Department through Enterprise Ireland for the Scheme, the Local Authorities are the granting authority in each of their respective areas in accordance with the criteria for the Scheme and the Local Authorities make grant payments to the bank account of qualifying businesses, in accordance with the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Restart Grant is just one part of a wider assistance package for business and for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs.  Within the funding available so far, the priority has been to assist those who have suffered most, including closure of the business, but whom will still have incurred ongoing costs.</p>  <p>  As of 10 July 2020, 40,506 businesses have applied for &euro;141.7 million  in grants. A total sum of &euro;94,795,163 in grants has been disbursed to businesses by local authorities to date, in respect of 23,326 applications.</p>  <p>  A further sum of &euro;15,044,550 is due to be paid in respect of applications which have recently been approved. </p>  <p>  The Restart grant scheme has been broadly welcomed by those businesses which have benefitted.  However, the July stimulus package, among other things, needs to help all firms meet the fixed, non-wage costs incurred during lockdown and in re-opening.  Our current Restart Grant is a significant help and I am keen to widen and deepen its impact.  That is why a review has commenced to identify the effectiveness of the Scheme and also, in line with an undertaking given in the Programme for Government, to carry out a general review of the Restart Grant which will be concluded shortly. </p></reply>

The Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. </p><p>These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see my Departments website on .</p><p>My Department has put in place a number of loan schemes to provide access to funding to meet working capital and investment needs of microenterprises and SMEs to meet the strong demand for cash availability.</p><p>The full range of Local Enterprise Office advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p><p>As stated in the Programme for Government, we will bring forward a July Stimulus to support our economy and help restore employment. Our focus is to support the viability of the business and enterprise sector and to get people back to work as quickly as possible in all sectors including the tourism sector. Helping our SMEs is central to this, given their pivotal role in the economy and employment. The July Stimulus will extend, enhance and add to the existing measures totalling &euro;12bn in supports for Covid-19 impacted businesses already announced.</p><p>Currently, any business (Sole Trader, Partnership or Limited Company) with less than 10 full time employees and annual turnover of up to &euro;2m may apply to Microfinance Ireland for funding from &euro;5,000 &ndash; &euro;50,000 where the business is not in a position to avail of finance from Banks and other commercial lending providers.The loan incurs 0% interest for the first six months and Zero repayments.  Thereafter a reduced interest rate of 4.5% APR applies to loans applied for through the Local Enterprise Office.</p><p>The Restart Grant, for example, is just one part of a wider assistance package for business and for firms of all sizes.  Businesses in this particular segment of the tourism sector are eligible to apply for the Restart grant if they operate from rateable premises; for example, an office location and rented storage space for equipment.  Under the current rules of the scheme, if an entrepreneur operates such a service from their home, they are not eligible for the grant. </p><p>Regarding any further targeted measures specifically aimed at the tourism and hospitality sectors, in March 2020 a dedicated Tourism Recovery Taskforce was established made up of leaders from various sectors of the industry, who will work together to deal with the many challenges ahead.  It has been specifically tasked with identifying measures required to enable Irish tourism to recover from the devastating effects of COVID19.</p><p>Local enterprise offices also offer a Trading Online Voucher Scheme, this scheme is funded by the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment and delivered nationwide in partnership with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the 31 Local Enterprise Offices. There has been a tremendous demand for the scheme from enterprises across the country since its expansion. </p><p>On the 8th of June the Government announced additional funding of &euro;14.2m to continue the Scheme bringing the total funding allocation in 2020 to &euro;19.8m. This additional funding will allow LEOs to approve additional vouchers to successful applicants. The Scheme offers skills training, mentoring and financial support of up to &euro;2,500 to help small and micro-businesses to develop their ecommerce capability. New flexibilities to the Scheme were introduced in April including reducing the requirement for co-funding from 50% to 10% and allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one. As you may be aware the Schemes outlined above offer specific, experienced mentoring for their clients. </p><p>All LEOs also offer a number of &lsquo;soft&rsquo; supports in the form of training or mentoring such as:</p><p><b>The Mentor Programme</b>which is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance.</p><p><b>The LEO Management Development programmes</b>which provide the owner-manager with the management, leadership, business skills and knowledge to achieve sustainability and growth in their business. </p><p><b>LEAN for Micro</b>which is a targeted programme for Local Enterprise Office clients to help small businesses boost competitiveness, increase performance and profitability as well as building resilience within their companies.</p><p>Further to this, if a potential business is not eligible for direct grant aid, an entrepreneur with a viable business proposal can also use their LEO to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI of 6.8% if they make their application through the LEOs.</p><p>My former colleague, the then Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty announced on 25 June that the Department&rsquo;s Enterprise Support Grant will be made available to assist self-employed recipients who are exiting the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) scheme with a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 to re-start their business. The grant will be payable to self-employed micro enterprises which employ fewer than 10 people, have an annual turnover of less than &euro;1 million and are not eligible for support from the COVID19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants. </p><p>All COVID19 business Schemes are under constant review in terms of the evolving situation and will be adapted as circumstances dictate. In that regard, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government and all stakeholders to examine further assistance to businesses impacted by Covid-19.  </p><p>My former colleagues, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross and the then Minister of State for Tourism and Sport, Brendan Griffin, recently established a special Tourism Recovery Taskforce with an Independent Chair, dedicated to spearheading economic recovery for the tourism sector and ancillary activities to prepare recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover and to identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023. </p></reply>

My Department, IDA Ireland and the other enterprise agencies under my remit are doing everything possible to support businesses and get people safely back to work, whether in Mayo or elsewhere. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland's results for the first six months of this year have demonstrated the particular resilience of our foreign direct investment (FDI) base. Despite the challenges we have faced this year - over 130 investments to date in 2020, which have the potential to create almost 10,000 jobs. Almost half of these new projects were secured for locations outside Dublin, with 53 investments from companies investing in Ireland for the first time.</p>  <p>  Mayo has experienced year-on-year increases in employment by IDA client companies since 2013, with 108 net new jobs created in 2019. There are now 17 IDA client companies in the county employing nearly 5,000 people. Mayo is home to a number of particularly prominent multinationals - such as Allergan, Baxter Healthcare and Coca Cola - that continue to perform well. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes in his question, the IDA's Business and Technology Park in Castlebar has also helped to attract FDI to the County. Last September, I had the honour of visiting this Business Park to attend the official opening of Fort Wayne Metals' new manufacturing facility, which will create more than 80 new jobs over the next five years. Whilst there are currently no plans in place to establish a new science and technology park in Castlebar, the IDA continues to review its property and land portfolio on an ongoing basis, in line with the strong emphasis it places on FDI in regional Ireland. Regional development, including for the West, will also again be at the heart of the forthcoming new IDA strategy and I will bring the Deputy's proposal to their attention.</p></reply>

Last December my department published the Remote Work in Ireland report. This outlined the prevalence and types of remote working in existence in Ireland. It also identified influencing factors on the part of both employers and employees.</p>  <p>  One of the findings of the report was the need for further guidance for employers and employees. My department is now working to deliver guidance that will fill that need. An Interdepartmental Group, consisting of relevant departments and agencies, has been formed to steer the delivery of this guidance. </p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Guidance for Working Remotely during COVID-19' webpage is a central access point for all of the Government guidance currently available on remote working. The allows employers and employees to navigate the existing guidance easily and helps to inform those working from home during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Last week we launched a public consultation on remote working guidance. This consultation will help us to understand what remote working issues are most pressing for employers and employees. The submissions that we receive will allow us to identify areas where further guidance can be provided and will also shape future remote working policy. I encourage all interested parties to take part in this consultation, the full details of which can be found on my department&rsquo;s website. It is open until August 7th.</p>  <p>  Following the results of the consultation, we will work to further refine the current remote working guidance. This work will be completed later this year.</p>  <p>  Remote working is also an important part of the work of the enterprise agencies. For example, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional plan, &lsquo;Powering the Regions&rsquo; emphasises the importance of smart working and commits to the creation of co-working spaces. To date, Enterprise Ireland has invested over &euro;180 million in Enterprise Centres, Incubator Hubs and shared office space.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland are also aware of the potential business benefits of remote working. In collaboration with Laois Offaly Education and Training Board (ETB), SOLAS and Grow Remote, the IDA have recently launched two new online national training programmes in response to COVID-19. These courses aim to develop the capability and capacity of current remote workers, future remote workers and line managers nationally. </p>  <p>  Through all of these initiatives, my department aims to facilitate the further development of remote working in our country.</p></reply>

As part of this service, ITI has run a series of awareness-raising events to help improve knowledge of customs processes and procedures, as well as identifying actions businesses cant take in areas like logistics and supply chain management. </p>  <p>   ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Planning Voucher enables eligible businesses to seek professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for Brexit. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, and regulatory and customs issues. Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. </p>  <p>  ITI has also launched a further financial support in the form of the Brexit Implementation Voucher, which offers financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50% towards implementing critical changes in relation to Brexit matters. </p>  <p>  The network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) around the country is the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business, including businesses in the border counties. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. The LEOs also offer customs training workshops to support businesses trading with third countries in advance of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p>  <p>  The LEOs also engage in a number of other schemes to help businesses prepare for Brexit. The Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export is offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. </p>  <p>  The six LEOs in the Border region are also working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully.  </p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short-term working capital, for up to three years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties. Dublin aside, the most recent quarterly report shows that the border region is the most active region in terms of eligibility applications for the scheme. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme provides a longer-term facility, for 8-10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment at competitive rates. This scheme has been jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make available loans of &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for primary agriculture) to &euro;3 million, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis.  The scheme is open to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  As of 3 July, there have been 4,200 eligibility applications received, of which 3,960 have been approved and 1,126 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;244.34 million. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland [EI] has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s Customs Insights course helps businesses looking at customs for the first time to understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes. The course advises on the key actions companies can take to prepare for Brexit and highlights the various supports available. </p>  <p>  While we have seen strong uptake of the Brexit supports available to businesses, I am conscious that the prolonged uncertainty around the Brexit process may have led businesses to have deferred their preparations, and that this has likely been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is important to understand that the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU will bring change for Irish businesses and I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help.</p></reply>

These proposals, along with others from Ministerial colleagues, will be developed and adjusted further for the Government&rsquo;s consideration of an ambitious stimulus package which will be announced soon.</p>  <p>  There are some welcome signs of improvement in business activity and the economy. However, sectors that employ a lot of people, such as tourism and hospitality, arts and entertainment and other services that rely on social interaction, remain in serious difficulty and their recovery prospects are highly uncertain.  </p>  <p>  The July Stimulus needs to help all firms meet the fixed, non-wage costs incurred during lockdown and in re-opening.  Our current Restart Grant is a help, but I recognise it has limitations which are preventing it from having a deeper and wider impact. </p>  <p>  In improving access to finance, there is a need to not only guarantee credit but do so in a way which does not add costs to businesses unduly. As well as this, and looking to the long-term, the important area of seed and venture capital needs strengthening.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices are the &lsquo;First Stop Shop&rsquo; for anyone seeking information about supports available for businesses. Located in the 31 Local Authorities Offices nationwide, the LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p>  <p>  I would urge seasonal businesses to talk to their Local Enterprise Offices regarding the supports available as they offer advice, training and mentoring which could be extremely beneficial to a business.</p>  <p>  The full range of Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant supports will be available to firms to help with strategies to innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness.  For seasonal businesses wishing to have an on-line presence, the Local Enterprise Office trading on-line voucher is designed to assist small businesses with up to 10 employees. It offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 along with training and advice to help your business trade online. It should however be noted that it is a requirement of the scheme that a business be operational for 6 months to be eligible to apply for this scheme.</p></reply>

These are loans and must be repaid with interest. It is therefore advantageous for businesses with sufficient cash reserves to continue to operate from those reserves, rather than to avail of these supports and incur additional costs. </p>  <p>  In relation to Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices, there are specific criteria laid down for each scheme of support and companies must meet these criteria to be successful in their applications.</p>  <p>  These supports are part of the overall package of Government support measures for enterprise, and are designed to meet funding needs that cannot be met elsewhere (whether from the company itself or other funding providers).</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland financial supports for COVID-19 have the objective of supporting companies impacted by COVID-19 to access liquidity and to underpin their long-term viability.</p>  <p>  The Sustaining Enterprise Fund of up to &euro;800k, for example, is structured to support a co-financed business stabilisation plan.  There is a robust due diligence process in place.  In that regard, specific criteria are examined during the application and decision-making process which include the impact that COVID-19 has had on the company and the company&rsquo;s liquidity or funding need.  Included are considerations as to how individual firms might respond to that impact and to rebuild the company&rsquo;s financial position including the ability of the company to access funding from other sources.  The proposal for funding is submitted to Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Investment Committee which is composed of both internal members from Enterprise Ireland, external private sector members and Departmental Officials which ultimately approves the funding to the company.</p>  <p>  For LEO grant applications, the applicants have to provide certified accounts if already in business. Their financial health, including cash reserves, is evaluated by the Local Enterprise Office Evaluation and Approvals Committee (EVAC) when considering a grant proposal. Under the assessment criteria, evaluation committees&rsquo; pay due regard to the general principle of need for necessary funding to ensure the establishment or development of the enterprise including whether there is sufficient cash available that would support a project without state support.</p>  <p>  As stated in the Programme for Government, we will bring forward a July stimulus to assist businesses to remain open, to encourage economic growth and to help restore employment. Our focus is to support the viability of the business and enterprise sector and to get people back to work as quickly as possible in all sectors.</p>  <p>  Helping our SMEs is central to this, given their pivotal role in the economy and employment growth. The July Stimulus will extend, enhance and add to the existing measures totalling &euro;12bn in supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses already announced.</p></reply>

Data centres are an increasingly important part of the digital and communications sectors, and are core infrastructure in the remote working and digital services economy. The 2018 Government Statement on Data Centres sets out the strategic importance of data centres to Ireland&rsquo;s overarching enterprise policy and their role in attracting employment and investment to Ireland within the technology sector. </p>  <p>  Data centres are also considerable energy demand loads on our electricity grid. Ireland has an ambitious target for decarbonising our electricity supply, with  the Climate Action Plan 2019 setting a target of 70% renewable electricity by 2030. The Department for Climate Action is progressing the Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) and a series of capacity auctions designed to help us reach that target.</p>  <p>  As significant electricity purchasers, data centres in Ireland can help drive the transition to renewable electricity, ensuring that the digital services they provide for society are delivered in an efficient and environmentally sustainable way. Indeed, many of the large technology multinationals with data centres in Ireland have made commitments to achieve 100% renewable energy. </p>  <p>  Under the 2019 Climate Action Plan and the Government Statement, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are leading a working group to encourage investment in renewable electricity generation using Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPA). The use of these contracts, which facilitate large energy users such as data centres to procure renewable energy directly from generators, has already begun in Ireland. The Working Group is examining what policy actions can be taken to facilitate this market and my Department is participating on this group, with engagement from the enterprise agencies. Through direct procurement of additional renewable electricity, large energy users would be contributing to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s renewable electricity target. </p></reply>

Judge Brian Cregan is the Commission&rsquo;s Sole Member.  </p>  <p>  As required under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, at the time of the Commission&rsquo;s establishment my Department published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il a Statement of Costs and Timeframe in relation to the Commission.  The Statement of Costs and Timeframe indicated that it was expected the Commission would report by the end of 2015, subject to section 6 (6) of the Act, and that the estimated salary costs, legal fees and administrative costs for the Commission in 2015 was &euro;4 million.</p>  <p>  The Statement of Costs and Timeframe also made it clear that third party costs might arise and that guidelines concerning third party costs would be prepared.  In this regard the Commission&rsquo;s Legal Costs Guidelines were subsequently agreed and have also been published.  </p>  <p>  Since the Commission was established, Judge Cregan has requested multiple  extensions to its deadline for reporting on the Siteserv transaction in the Interim Reports he has provided my predecessors as Taoiseach under section 33 (3) of the Act. </p>  <p>  On each of these occasions, consultations took place between my predecessors and Opposition representatives to discuss the issues arising in the Commission&rsquo;s Interim Reports, including the request for extensions by the Commission and the estimated increase in costs, before such extensions were granted.</p>  <p>  Most recently, in February 2020 Judge Cregan requested a further extension of the Commission&rsquo;s deadline for reporting in relation to the Siteserv transaction until the end of 2020.  In view of the pressures arising in relation to Covid-19 and talks on the formation of a new Government, the Commission&rsquo;s timeframe for reporting was extended until end-June and then end-September 2020 pending consultation with Oireachtas representatives, which I hope to arrange shortly. </p>  <p>  From the date of its establishment to 8th July 2020, the IBRC Commission spent a total of &euro;7,990,162, excluding third party legal costs that have been incurred but not yet paid.  The Commission has estimated that the final cost of the completion of the first module of its investigation, will be from &euro;11 - &euro;14 million.  However, this estimate assumes the investigation is completed in accordance with the timetable stated by the Commission and excludes costs or delays associated with judicial review hearings.  The Commission also acknowledges that it involves a substantial degree of uncertainty regarding the amount of costs actually recoverable by parties before the Commission, and it assumes the Commission&rsquo;s Legal Costs Guidelines are not successfully challenged.  My Department has given its view on many occasions, including in briefings with Oireachtas representatives, that the final cost is likely to significantly exceed the Commission&rsquo;s estimate, and could exceed &euro;30m.</p></reply>

So far this year, of the twenty-nine workplace fatalities reported to the Health and Safety Authority fourteen have been in that sector and tragically, three of these involved young children. </p>  <p>  The agriculture sector is different to other sectors in a number of aspects. Farms as well as being workplaces are usually homes with children and the elderly also living on the farm. Many farmers are part time or have employment off the farm.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority has an extensive agriculture health and safety programme which focusses on the provision of advice, guidance, e-tools and educational supports as well as inspections and investigations. This programme is completed in a collaborative manner with key farming stakeholder groups and relevant Government Departments and State Agencies. The focus of these efforts is to put measures in place that can prevent the high levels of injuries and fatalities in the agriculture sector. </p>  <p>  In the past few weeks, the Health and Safety Authority ran a Farm Safety Media Campaign, designed to promote the farm safety message, particularly regarding tractor safety, through TV, Radio, Farming Press and social media platforms. The Health and Safety Authority also participated in TV interviews focusing firstly on child safety on farms during the COVID lockdown and, secondly, in response to examples of poor behaviour by young farmers featuring on social media. It also conducted a specific Livestock Safety Campaign in the first quarter 2020 during which 340 Livestock Safety inspections were carried out in addition to routine inspections.</p>  <p>  With the announcement of Government restrictions due to COVID-19, the Health and Safety Authority continued to investigate farm fatalities, but proactive farm safety inspections were suspended. In recent weeks, the inspectors of the Health and Safety Authority have focussed inspections on sectors and businesses reopening post-lockdown with a particular emphasis on compliance issues relating to the Return to Work Safely Protocol. </p>  <p>  However, the Health and Safety Authority are now resuming routine inspections across all sectors, including agriculture, and in that regard, are running a farm safety campaign from 13 July for two weeks focusing on tractor and machinery safety. Many other major stakeholders are also involved in Farm Safety Week which is industry led and will run from Monday 20 July. This 2-week campaign will be supported by media advertising including social media. </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will co-fund a farm safety media campaign involving TV, Radio and print media on farm safety later this year. In addition, the Health and Safety Authority will work in close co-operation with Minister Heydon and colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in order to continue efforts to improve safety on farms.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is also finalising a New Farm Safety Strategy (2021-2023). This strategy will focus on developing a &ldquo;safety culture&rdquo; within the agriculture sector by establishing safety norms through education and awareness raising.</p></reply>

The Health and Safety Authority inspectorate has been supplemented by approximately 500 other inspectors from across the system to monitor the application of the Return to Work Safely Protocol. These additional inspectors are drawn from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Environmental Health Officers employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and they are checking compliance with the Protocol as part of their normal inspection duties.</p><p>Since the start of Phase 3, which included the reopening of the hospitality and tourism sectors, the Environment Health Officers have been particularly active checking businesses in these sectors.  I am pleased that a high level of compliance has been reported.  In total up to the 8<sup>th</sup>of July, which is the latest information available, over 6,500 Return to Work Safely inspections were completed by the combined inspectorate. Over 1,400 of these were completed between 29<sup>th</sup>of June and the 8<sup>th</sup>of July and many of these inspections focused on the food and tourism sector.  Inspection figures are provided at aggregate level on a weekly basis.</p><p>In terms of the HSA specifically, overall since the economy reopened to the 8<sup>th</sup>of July the Authority has carried out 2,236 Return to Work Safely inspections.

The EU-Mercosur Agreement is the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date.  The Agreement covers a population of over 770 million with trade in goods and services valued at &euro;122 billion.  It aims to reduce and, in some areas, eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.  In 2019, Ireland exported approximately &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region.  In 2018 &ndash; the latest year for which data is available &ndash; services exports to Mercosur totalled almost &euro;1.3 billion.  Irish goods exports to Mercosur have grown on average by 2% annually and Mercosur accounts for 0.3% of total Irish goods exports in 2019.  </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the EU-Mercosur Agreement will allow Irish exporters to expand faster and will open opportunities across a wide range of sectors &ndash; in business services, chemicals, machinery, medical devices and processed food and dairy.  The Agreement once ratified, will see a significant reduction or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade that will allow a cross flow of trading and investment between Ireland and the rest of the EU, and the Mercosur region.  The EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement will make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase the demand for Irish products.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government Our Shared Future committed the Government to an Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment of the EU-Mercosur trade deal.  That Impact Assessment will produce both a robust analysis of the potential economic impacts as well as the social, human rights and environmental impacts that the trade agreement offers.  It will also include a wide-ranging consultation process and engagement with relevant stakeholders and is being produced by an independent economic consultancy firm with the aim of helping to inform future decisions by Government on the Agreement.</p>  <p>  I might add that European Trade Commissioner, Phil Hogan, recently reported to the European Parliament's "INTA" International Trade Committee that the final legal texts of the Agreement have been reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;, and that the final document will now be translated into the various EU and Mercosur languages, a process that is estimated will be completed by October. After this, the Agreement will be submitted by the Commission to the EU Council for the approval of EU Member States and to the European Parliament. My Department's intention, working in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, is for Government to have the aforementioned Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment available to us to assist our decision-making on the Agreement in the Autumn.</p></reply>

Last December my Department published the Remote Work in Ireland report. This outlined the prevalence and types of remote working in existence in Ireland. It also identified influencing factors on the part of both employers and employees.</p>  <p>  One of the findings of the report was the need for further guidance for employers and employees. My Department is now working to deliver guidance that will fill that need. An Interdepartmental Group, consisting of relevant departments and agencies, has been formed to steer the delivery of this guidance. </p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Guidance for Working Remotely during COVID-19' webpage is a central access point for all of the Government guidance currently available on remote working. It allows employers and employees to navigate the existing guidance easily and helps to inform those working from home during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Last week we launched a public consultation on remote working guidance. This consultation will help us to understand what remote working issues are most pressing for employers and employees. The submissions that we receive will allow us to identify areas where further guidance can be provided and will also shape future remote working policy. I encourage all interested parties to take part in this consultation, the full details of which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website. It is open until August 7th.</p>  <p>  Following the results of the consultation, we will work to further refine the current remote working guidance. This work will be completed later this year.</p>  <p>  Remote working is also an important part of the work of the enterprise agencies. For example, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional plan, &lsquo;Powering the Regions&rsquo; emphasises the importance of smart working and commits to the creation of co-working spaces. To date, Enterprise Ireland has invested over &euro;180 million in Enterprise Centres, Incubator Hubs and shared office space.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland are also aware of the potential business benefits of remote working. In collaboration with Laois Offaly Education and Training Board (ETB), SOLAS and Grow Remote, the IDA have recently launched two new online national training programmes in response to COVID-19. These courses aim to develop the capability and capacity of current remote workers, future remote workers and line managers nationally. </p>  <p>  Through all of these initiatives, my Department aims to facilitate the further development of remote working in our country.</p></reply>

These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. </p><p>Horizontal supports that are applicable to the Retail Sector include the Working Capital scheme, Future Growth Loan Scheme, COVID-19 Loan from MicroFinance Ireland and the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme.  For a full list of supports for business please see </p><p>The growth in demand for shopping online domestically and globally is driving the retail sector more broadly to develop its online capability in order to enhance its competitiveness. Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term. </p><p>The objective of the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme - a competitive scheme, administered on my Department's behalf by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector who have already started an online journey, to further enhance and strengthen their online presence, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. </p><p>My Department proposed this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must be an indigenous retailer, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. </p><p>Under the first call of this scheme I recently announced that 183 retailers will receive funding of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;40,000 under the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme competitive call totalling &euro;6.5 million.  The second call is due to open in the coming weeks.  </p><p>This Scheme is not about taking the first steps; it is about raising the bar, in an informed, planned and strategic way. Further details on this Scheme available at </p><p>In addition, there was a major expansion of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme to help small and micro enterprises, with up to 10 employees, including those in the retail sector, to get online quickly.</p><p>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme is being expanded by &euro;14.2m after the Local Enterprise Offices received 3 years&rsquo; worth of applications in 3 months following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland. Following a previous expansion of the Scheme in early April, total additional funding for the Scheme is now almost &euro;20m in 2020.</p><p>Under the Scheme, small businesses can claim up to &euro;5,000 in two vouchers worth &euro;2,500 each.

Apart from some exceptions, the reopening of most sectors was brought forward to Phase 3, which began on Monday 29th June.  This includes theatres, concert halls, music venues and other culture outlets. Gatherings of up to 50 people indoors or 200 people outdoors are currently permissible when conducted in line with public health advice. However, specific recommendations apply in relation to singing, choirs and the playing of musical instruments in groups. These are available for review at </p><p>Phase 4 of Roadmap is due to commence on 20 July, subject to public health advice and Government approval. Gatherings of up to 100 people indoors and 500 people outdoors will be permissible in this phase provided social distancing and relevant public health advice is adhered to. </p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and employees the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at  .</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace. If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie.</p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see .</p><p>I understand the impact that the pandemic is having on the social and cultural life of citizens right across the country. I know that employers, employees and the self-employed in the live music and entertainment sector want to get back to organising events for larger audiences than are currently permitted due to the public health risks associated with COVID-19. I wish to assure all in this sector that I will work with my Government colleagues to secure further details and clarity as we progress through the final phase of the Roadmap and beyond. It is important to note, however, that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions will be informed by the public health advice at the time.</p></reply>

It operates in parallel with existing statutory workplace health and safety requirements. The Protocol clearly sets out for employers and employees the steps that they must take both before a workplace reopens and on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is the lead agency in monitoring compliance with the Protocol. In this regard, any  employee who has concerns about compliance can contact the Health and Safety Authority Workplace Contact Unit (WCU) on a confidential basis at 1890 289  389 or by sending an email to wcu@hsa.ie. If following such a complaint, there are serious concerns about a particular workplace, the Health and Safety Authority, or another agency or tasked with inspecting workplace compliance with the Protocol, will follow-up as appropriate.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve compliance with the Protocol the Health and Safety Authority can use its powers under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005. Under this Act there is a suite of enforcement powers ranging from Improvement Directions, up to and including, Prohibition Notices, which an inspector can serve where there is evidence of breaches of legislation. However, any initial engagement with an employer is carried out with the aim of achieving required outcomes through consensus and collaboration e.g. advice, Reports of Inspections (ROI). However a failure to comply with a ROI is an offence.</p>  <p>  As part of the whole of Government approach, 500 inspectors from across the public service system are now monitoring adherence to the Protocol as part of their own normal inspection duties and are supplementing the work of the Health and Safety Authority. These resources are drawn from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the cohort of Environmental Health Officers. </p>  <p>  In addition to inspections, the Health and Safety Authority continues to provide advice and support to employers and employees on how they are implementing the COVID-19 measures in the workplace through its helpline and website and it has developed checklists and templates for use by employers, workers and worker representatives, and further material is being developed. </p>  <p>  Separately, I would add that, overall, the Health and Safety Authority has noted a high level of compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol, to date, across all sectors which is a positive indication that the majority of employers and employees are taking a responsible approach to compliance with the Protocol.</p></reply>

The July package will also seek to ensure we are best placed to exploit emerging opportunities and attract high value projects with significant economic benefits and to position our economy and firms to meet future challenges. In the near-term, this includes helping companies further in overcoming the challenges of Brexit, but we also need to include measures that build enterprise resilience and help them transition to a low carbon future.  </p><p>My colleague, Minister Eamon Ryan T.D., Minister for Transport may be able to provide more specific guidance on supports suitable for the travel sector, including the consumer related measure in the COVID-19 Refund Credit Note which was introduced under consumer related legislation, the package travel and travel trade licensing legislation, for which he has lead responsibility.</p></reply>

Our focus is to support the viability of the business and to get people back to work as quickly as possible in all sectors including the hospitality sector.</p><p>Helping our SMEs is central to this, given their pivotal role in the economy and employment. The July Stimulus will extend, enhance and add to the existing measures totalling &euro;12bn in supports for Covid-19 impacted businesses already announced.</p><p>These measures include direct grants and supports such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the &euro;250m Restart Grant Fund, liquidity supports such as 0% finance for 6 months from MicroFinance Ireland, rates waivers from local authorities and warehousing of tax liabilities of SMEs by Revenue. </p><p>These supports are predominately focused on our SMEs, who have been hardest hit by the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p><p>We are reviewing the future of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).  As the public health restrictions are eased, the challenge for the economy, SMEs and all businesses is evolving.  Work is currently on-going around how best to continue to support employers into the more medium term, including consideration of support for temporary seasonal workers and new hires.</p><p>The launch of the &euro;250m Restart Grant on the 22 May last is an example of how we are providing support for the costs of restarting a business, including to meet the costs of refitting of premises to meet health and safety requirements. The Restart Grant provide a direct payment to local businesses of between &euro;2,000 to &euro;10,000 to help them meet the costs of reopening. </p><p>The range of supports available from my Department and across Government are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see .</p><p>The full range of Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p><p>In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises including micro-enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p><p>The Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis and is working successfully.  In under three months, MFI has approved Covid-19 loans of over &euro;14.3 million, which is more than double the value of total loans approved for the entire year in 2019.</p><p>These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. </p><p>An interest rate to 4.5% applies on the Covid-19 loans provided by MFI.  This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%.As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan. </p><p>The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI.</p><p>It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200 million to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following a further announcement, work is now under way on a significant expansion to this Scheme.</p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) negatively impacted by Covid-19. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m and are for periods of up to three years. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured.</p><p>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme is funded by the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment and delivered nationwide in partnership with my Department, Enterprise Ireland and the 31 Local Enterprise Offices. There has been a tremendous demand for the scheme from enterprises across the country since its expansion and I am pleased that it provides a grant of up to &euro;2,500 to cover up to 90% of the cost for a business going online. </p><p>My colleague and former Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys T.D., announced on the 8th of June an additional funding of &euro;14.2m for the Scheme bringing the total funding allocation in 2020 to &euro;19.8m. This additional funding will allow LEOs to approve additional vouchers to successful applicants. The Scheme offers skills training, mentoring and financial support of up to &euro;2,500 to help small and micro-businesses to develop their ecommerce capability. New flexibilities to the Scheme were introduced in April including reducing the requirement for co-funding from 50% to 10% and allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one. There has been a positive response to these changes and significant uptake of the Scheme.  </p><p>Continued support for high-potential start-ups and the wider entrepreneurship base remains critically important to underpinning the growth and recovery of Irish enterprise. Through my agency&rsquo;s support for High Potential Start-Ups, Seed and Venture Capital funding, the Competitive Start Fund and New Frontiers Programme, Enterprise Ireland continues to deliver strong support for entrepreneurs and early stage companies. </p><p>My former colleague, the then Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty announced on 25 June that the Department&rsquo;s Enterprise Support Grant will be made available to assist self-employed recipients who are exiting the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) scheme with a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 to re-start their business. The grant will be payable to self-employed micro enterprises which employ fewer than 10 people, have an annual turnover of less than &euro;1 million and are not eligible for support from the COVID19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government and with all stakeholders, to examine all such appropriate business supports to assist microbusinesses impacted by Covid-19.</p></reply>

Where such window restrictions are an integral part of the window operating gear they come under the remit of the Construction Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 305/2011) and fall under the responsibility of my colleague&rsquo;s Department.</p>  <p>  In relation to window restrictors that are sold as separate items, which are not covered by EU harmonised standards, these products fall under the remit of the General Product Safety Directive (Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on General Product Safety). This Directive was transposed into Irish law by S.I. No. 199 of 2004 and thus come within the responsibility of my Department. </p>  <p>  Directive 2001/95/EC places the onus on all economic operators &ndash; manufacturers, distributors, importers &ndash; to ensure that only safe products are placed on the market. If economic operators become aware that products on the market present a potential hazard they must take appropriate measures, up to and including recall of the items, to ensure that the risk is removed. </p>  <p>  Any action taken by an operator must be notified to the relevant Market Surveillance Authority: in Ireland this is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which is statutorily independent in the carrying out of its functions.</p>  <p>  Where the CCPC finds unsafe products on the Irish market, it will act to ensure economic operators remove the product from the market until it is in compliance with the legislation. The CCPC is part of an EU wide network (known as Safety Gate) that allows for the rapid exchange of information between national market surveillance authorities on dangerous products found on the EU market. </p>  <p>  Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of unsafe products. As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, I, as the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation have no direct function in the matter.</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy have any information in relation to unsafe window restrictors on the Irish market, he should make contact with the CCPC directly to provide any relevant information on these matters.</p></reply>

Of the approximately 3,000 eligibility applications to date, only 15 have so far been deemed ineligible.  This scheme is subject to the participating banks&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures.</p>  <p>  Both myself and my predecessor, Heather Humphreys, have had regular meetings with representatives of the banks to ensure that issues raised by businesses as they apply for lending under these schemes are addressed. At these meetings, the banks have given assurance that they are working through large pipelines of applications for the Government Schemes, and I urged them to prioritise these essential supports for businesses. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the COVID-19 crisis.   These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to COVID-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. Interest rates of between 4.5% and 5.5% are available.  </p>  <p>  Loans of &euro;17.1 million have been approved since the commencement of the Scheme, compared to a total loan value approved in 2019 of &euro;6 million, and a pipeline of applications is being worked through.  Due to this unprecedented demand, lending to new applications through this scheme has currently been paused as legislation is required to increase the funding of MFI which is currently at capacity.  This legislation recently passed through the Oireachtas.  Microfinance Ireland and officials from my Department will work together to reopen this Loan Fund as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the announcement by the European Commission on 29th June 2020 of its adoption of the 3rd amendment to the Temporary Framework.  This amendment allows for support to be granted under the Temporary Framework to micro and small enterprises (up to 50 employees with less than EUR 10M annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet), even if they fall under the category of an undertaking in difficulty on 31 December 2019 provided that they are not subject to collective insolvency procedure under national law and have not received rescue or restructuring aid which has not yet been repaid).  Such aid is also intended to increase support possibilities to innovative start-ups in the high growth phase which are micro or small in size.</p>  <p>  This amendment will apply retrospectively to schemes already developed under the Temporary Framework, including the EI Sustaining Enterprise Fund.</p></reply>

The IDA has been working hard with its client base to help address and mitigate any risks faced by overseas companies already located here. </p>  <p>  The Agency has also, ever since the EU-UK referendum in June 2016, been seeking to realise opportunities to attract further Brexit-related FDI to Ireland. The significant efforts that the IDA has invested into these efforts have yielded impressive results. The Agency has won 92 Brexit-related investments with an associated jobs potential of 5,900, numbers which could yet increase further. </p>  <p>  The IDA has also taken steps to diversify its FDI source markets and to prepare for a potentially significantly changed post-Brexit economic and geopolitical landscape. This has included an international campaign in key markets and a restructuring of its European operations to treat the UK as a separate territory. The Agency has also deployed additional resources in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, as well as opening a new office in Toronto. </p>  <p>  More generally, I am confident that Ireland will remain attractive in the long-term to international investors. Our traditional strengths &ndash; including our talented workforce and pro-enterprise policy environment &ndash; remain very much intact and valued by overseas firms. I look forward to working, together with the IDA, to increase FDI here in the years ahead. </p></reply>

The Department of Finance&rsquo;s Stability Programme Update (SPU) published in April indicated that employment is projected to fall substantially with approximately 220,000 jobs being lost this year.  The Government's aim is to create 200,000 new jobs by 2025 as well as helping people currently unemployed due to COVID-19 back to work.</p>  <p>  Since I took up the role of Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my focus has been on preparing the July Stimulus Package which will save jobs, create new ones and get our people back to work as quickly as possible.  Not only must we overcome the current challenges, but we must also look ahead and set our economy on the right course for the future.  </p>  <p>  Already there are some welcome signs of improvement in business activity and the economy. However, sectors that employ a lot of people, such as tourism and hospitality, arts and entertainment and other services that rely on social interaction, continue to be in serious difficulty and their recovery prospects are highly uncertain. </p>  <p>  My officials and I have been engaging with colleagues across Government to ensure that the needs of business are to the forefront in the preparation of the July Stimulus package.  We know that many viable businesses will need additional support to help see them through the re-opening period and to help them adapt and refocus their business models. </p>  <p>  While immediate focus is on preserving existing firms and jobs, the July package should also have an eye to exploiting emerging opportunities and attract high value projects with significant economic benefits. Importantly, the July Initiative must position our economy and firms to meet future challenges. In the near-term, this includes helping companies further in overcoming the challenges of Brexit but we also need to include measures that build enterprise resilience and help them transition to a low carbon future.  </p></reply>

Under the German Presidency we will debate a wide variety of topics at each Council aimed at supporting Member employment policies and enterprises, particularly SMEs, encouraging economic growth and improving the EU's competitiveness, all of which I believe will impact on job creation. </p>  <p>  At the Employment and Social Affairs Council, I will engage with my fellow Ministers on key employment  challenges facing us, guidelines on employment policies and strengthening minimum income protection. There may also be an opportunity to discuss a new youth employment guarantee. At the Competitiveness Council we will consider how best to strengthen the Single Market for a strong recovery and a competitive, sustainable Europe, and how to develop our enterprises for growth and employment.

The Department&rsquo;s leadership across a number of Government strategies, including Future Jobs Ireland, will be to the fore in this regard. The focus will not only be on measures which address the current challenges facing the enterprise sector but also on ensuring the long-term viability of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base. This will require the transformation of our enterprises to seize strategic opportunities in fast developing sectors and adapt to technological and climate changes under way.</p>  <p>  My Department is actively participating in EU Commission considerations of the appropriate trade policy measures that best marry the needs of our response to the pandemic with our strong support for open, rules-based, multilateral trade that supports wealth creation and good jobs. Two key elements include short-term transparent, targeted, temporary and proportionate measures as well as revisions to the EU&rsquo;s guiding trade policy, the review of which opened last month and on which Trade Ministers, including myself, will input to in the autumn.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of a National SME Growth Plan that will map out an ambitious long-term strategic blueprint beyond COVID-19. The National SME Growth Plan will be largely informed by the comprehensive OECD Report on &ldquo;SME &amp;amp; Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland&rdquo;, which was published last year. It will include detailed proposals to help SMEs to start up, scale up and access foreign markets. It will look at ways to make SMEs more productive and ready for the transition to a digital, green economy. It will also make improvements to areas such as local entrepreneurship ecosystems and local industry clusters to drive regional development. This Plan will be brought to Government for approval as part of the National Economic Plan in October. The Growth Plan will align with and build on existing SME policy initiatives, such as those set out in Future Jobs Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government identifies a number of groups which will be led by Government in shaping the engagement of enterprise and SMEs in the formulation of the policy responses at the different stages of the recovery:</p>  <p>  - Sectoral taskforces to focus on the specific needs of sectors, and to bring forward plans in the context of the National Economic Plan;</p>  <p>  - An SME and State Bodies Group, to be chaired jointly by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Business, to co-ordinate the ongoing response to COVID-19 for SMEs;</p>  <p>  - An SME Growth Taskforce, to design a National SME Growth Plan that will map out an ambitious long-term strategic blueprint beyond COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The first meeting of the SME and State Bodies Group took place on Friday last. Both myself and the Minister for Finance, along with Ministers of State Damien English and Robert Troy met with business representative groups and State Bodies to discuss SME financing challenges and how to solve these.</p></reply>

Not only must we overcome the current challenges, but we must also look ahead and set our economy on the right course for the future.</p>  <p>  Already there are some welcome signs of improvement in business activity and the economy. However, sectors that employ a lot of people, such as tourism and hospitality, arts and entertainment and other services that rely on social interaction, continue to be in serious difficulty and their recovery prospects are highly uncertain. While we can&rsquo;t keep every firm and job alive, I believe our emphasis should still be to preserve these insofar as we can.</p>  <p>  The July package will be followed in October by the National Economic Plan to be published on the same day as the Budget. The National Economic Plan will chart out our longer-term, jobs-led recovery.</p>  <p>  I expect the Economic Plan will include a major reskilling programme, policies to promote balanced regional development and it will emphasise the importance of attracting and sustaining Foreign Direct Investment.</p>  <p>  Before this crisis the Irish economy was performing stronger than ever. Last year, the Government launched Future Jobs Ireland to help make our economy more resilient and innovative and to facilitate enterprises and workers transition in light of technological development and climate change imperatives. The need to ensure the economy is green, digital and resilient hasn&rsquo;t gone way. Therefore, the Future Jobs Ireland framework will be updated in light of these, the crisis, and new priorities.</p>  <p>  Additionally, a new SME Growth Taskforce shortly will be formed with representation from a wide range of business representative bodies and enterprise agencies.</p></reply>

In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified. </p>  <p>  The Irish exporting landscape has been strong and companies in Ireland have been succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services.  Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved record levels of exports in 2018 (latest year for which figures are available) of &euro;23.8bn, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. In 2018, the Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 7.6% to &euro;4.8bn, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1bn in exports.  Exports to North America increased from &euro;3.87bn in 2017 to &euro;4.08bn in 2018, an increase of 5.5%.  Our Enterprise agencies are now opening new offices around the world to support our companies in competing and thriving in global markets.  </p>  <p>  Ministerial-led Trade Missions have supported the Government's major drive towards market diversification.  The majority of trade missions in recent years have taken place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represented the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies.  These Trade Missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences.  Trade Missions will resume as soon as is practicable.  In the meantime, promotion of our companies abroad will continue through the work of our State agencies, and in particular their offices located on the ground internationally.  </p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more. The existing suite of EU Free Trade Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p></reply>

The agency had delivered a range of new supports to mitigate market shocks associated with Brexit and a contingency plan was in place for activation if required.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, Enterprise Ireland supported 2,000 Brexit exposed companies and administered &euro;125 million in supports to companies over a 2-year period. These preparations will stand to Irish enterprise as they seek to stabilise their businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic period and then position their companies to recover and grow once markets re-open.</p>  <p>  To assist businesses to address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, my Department with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports addressing stabilisation of business and access to finance to implement a business sustainment plan. In addition to this Enterprise Ireland remains committed to supporting companies build scale, innovate and expand reach. For example:</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland continues to engage with clients on a one-to-one basis to establish company need and will tailor a support package utilising the full suite of supports offered by the agency to address this need.</p>  <p>  - The agency&rsquo;s global network of 40 offices continues to support this activity via providing market intelligence to inform companies&rsquo; internationalisation strategies. </p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client management development programmes, including the delivery of mentoring services to companies, are now being delivered online to companies to support leadership and strategy development in client companies. </p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland is delivering trade events between Irish companies and overseas buyers online. This are key events for winning business overseas.</p>  <p>  - Funding to support regions build increased enterprise capability continues to be delivered. In June, &euro;17 million was awarded under the Border Enterprise Development Fund by the agency to 11 projects in the region.</p>  <p>  - In July an &lsquo;All Sectors&rsquo; and &lsquo;Women Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Competitive Start Fund was opened. The purpose of this fund is to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capacity to succeed in global markets.</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland continues to provide equity investment of up to &euro;800,000 on a co-funded basis, to innovation-led high potential start-ups that are developing and commercialising new or substantially improved technologies, products or services. </p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland is currently engaged in the second call of its Seed and Venture Capital Scheme (2019-2024), targeting funds investing into companies emerging from the third-level research organisations (Spin Outs).</p>  <p>  The impact of COVID-19 on Enterprise Ireland clients is unprecedented.  How and when the economies of domestic and international markets recover remains unclear. In addition, challenges such as Brexit and changes to the global trading outlook will challenge Irish enterprise in the months ahead. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will monitor the needs of sectors and companies as the situation evolves and provide new supports to meet changing company needs, as required. Indigenous Irish companies are the backbone of the economy and the agency is committed to helping these companies sustain their businesses.  </p></reply>

In that regard, I will soon be announcing the membership of an SME Growth Taskforce, which will have the capacity and expertise to progress work on thematic areas arising from recommendations by the OECD and to respond to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will cover themes including as entrepreneurship, productivity, digitalisation, competitiveness, internationalisation, clustering and networks.   The Growth Plan will align with and build on existing national SME policy initiatives. It will also be informed by the European Commission&rsquo;s very recent SME Strategy for a Sustainable and Digital Europe.</p>  <p>  At programmatic level, my Department officials and our agencies are continually working towards driving the creation of new enterprises in the indigenous sector. Last week, for example, Enterprise Ireland launched a &euro;2m Competitive Start Fund open to applicants for two competitions in the &lsquo;All Sectors&rsquo; and &lsquo;Women Entrepreneurs&rsquo; category. Each of the two &euro;1,000,000 funds will provide up to &euro;50,000 in equity funding to successful projects and may deliver the boost needed to scale up and bring their business to the next level.</p>  <p>  These competitive funds are part of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for increasing the number of diverse High Potential Start-Up companies (HPSUs) that have the qualities to achieve key commercial and technical milestones, including evaluating overseas market opportunities, building prototypes, developing market entry plans and securing third party investment.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) provide advice, information and support to businesses in starting up or growing their business. With 31 dedicated teams across the Local Authority network in Ireland, the LEOs offer a wide range of experience, skills and services. The full range of LEO advisory supports continue to be available throughout the regions to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p>  <p>  My Department has developed a range of proposals which I have brought to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment for consideration. These proposals, along with others from Ministerial colleagues, will be developed and adjusted further for the Government&rsquo;s consideration of an ambitious stimulus package which will be announced soon.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the July Initiative will aim to strategically position our economy and firms to meet future challenges. </p>  <p>  I look forward to announcing the details shortly.</p></reply>

The introduction of travel restrictions around the world is already, for example, disrupting the typical way in which the IDA engages with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, which are also faced by our competitor countries, IDA Ireland's results for the first six months of this year have demonstrated the resilience of our FDI base. The Agency has secured over 130 investments to date in 2020, which have the potential to create almost 10,000 jobs. Almost half of these new projects were secured for locations outside Dublin, with 53 investments from companies investing in Ireland for the first time. </p>  <p>  I believe that these 2020 investments reflect our continuing attractiveness to overseas firms. Overseas companies continue, the evidence would suggest, to value our FDI strengths. These include our talented and flexible work-force, a track record as a successful home to global businesses and a hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction. Our continued commitment to the European Union, the single market and Eurozone, as well as to free trade and multilateralism, are other key selling points that help us convince multinational companies to establish operations and create jobs here. </p>  <p>  At the same time, we do recognise that the global competition for FDI is intensifying and we are under no illusions that the time ahead will prove more challenging. We will have to fight, harder than ever before, for new investment projects and the jobs that go with them.  I look forward, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to taking on that challenge. This will include working with the IDA on the formulation of a new strategy that will guide the Agency's work in the time ahead.</p></reply>

If implemented correctly, it can stimulate regional growth, support the transition to a greener economy, reduce business costs and improve employees&rsquo; work-life balance.   </p>  <p>  However, for this to be possible, the necessary supports must be in place for business and employees to reap its benefits.  This is reflected in research undertaken by my Department on Remote Work in Ireland in December 2019. This report outlined the prevalence and types of remote working in Ireland. It also identified the influencing factors for both employers and employees. </p>  <p>  A key outcome identified in the Remote Work in Ireland report was the need for official guidance for employers and employees on a variety of different topics, such as equality, health and safety, employment conditions and the right to disconnect, data protection and training.  My Department is now working to deliver this guidance with a dedicated Interdepartmental Group comprising of all relevant Departments and Agencies. </p>  <p>  While this work is under way, my Department has a webpage which allows employers and employees to easily navigate the existing guidance on remote working. This webpage is a central access point for all of the Government guidance currently available on remote working. </p>  <p>  Amid the COVID19 pandemic, many of us have had to adjust to working remotely with minimal preparation. To gain insights from employers and employees on their key areas of concern, my Department has launched a public consultation on remote working guidance. The submissions will allow us to identify areas where further guidance can be provided and will also shape future remote working policy. I encourage all interested parties to take part in this consultation, the full details of which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Following the results of this consultation, my Department will use the insights and feedback arising from the submissions to further refine the current remote working guidance. This work will be completed before the end of 2020. </p></reply>

In that context, my colleague, Minister Eamonn Ryan, Minister for Communications has responsibility for policy matters related to the scheme including the eligibility criteria and funding.  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, in recognition of the increased demand for the scheme as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, my Department  has recently contributed &euro;7 million towards the Scheme to ensure that the scheme is adequately capitalised to meet the surge in demand from eligible applicant companies. </p>  <p>  The TOV scheme assists small business owners to move to an online trading platform where they could potentially increase domestic sales and their export capability. The Scheme offers skills training, mentoring and financial support of up to &euro;2,500 to help small and micro-businesses to develop their ecommerce capability.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the increased demand for the scheme and as a further assistance to microenterprises, the scope of the TOVs scheme was expanded to offer financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 with a reduced co-funding contribution from businesses from 90% to 10%.  The Scheme also contains a training and advice module for potential applicants.  </p>  <p>  On the 8th of June the Government announced additional funding of &euro;14.2m for the Scheme bringing the total funding allocation in 2020 to &euro;19.8m. This additional funding allowed LEOs to meet current demands for the Scheme. In addition, new flexibilities to the Scheme were introduced in April including allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one. To date over 7,000 applications have been received for the vouchers.  </p>  <p>  For enterprises with over 10 employees, Enterprise Ireland administers the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme.  The objective of the scheme is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector which have started an online journey which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both the domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. </p>  <p>  On 2nd July, I announced the successful applicants approved for funding through the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme. 183 retailers have been approved for &euro;6.5 million in funding as part of the scheme, almost three quarters of the successful applicants are located outside Dublin with 130 retailers from the regions approved for funding.</p>  <p>  The value of the scheme, which received 373 applications, was increased from &euro;2 million to &euro;6.5 million due to the high level of demand amongst retailers and the high quality of the proposals received.  The Scheme helps Irish-owned retailers to strategically enhance their online sales capabilities, so they can be more competitive, sustain jobs and subsequently scale their businesses in international markets.</p>  <p>  Under this COVID-19 competitive call, the successful applicants will receive funding ranging from &euro;16,000 to &euro;40,000 to strengthen their online offering. The average grant value is &euro;35,500. Enterprise Ireland will be opening a 2nd Call under the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

These proposals, along with others from Ministerial colleagues, will be developed and adjusted further for the Government&rsquo;s consideration, which will be announced soon.   </p>  <p>  The range of supports available from my Department and across Government are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for the weeks and months ahead. </p>  <p>  There are some welcome signs of improvement in business activity and the economy. However, sectors that employ a lot of people, such as tourism and hospitality, arts and entertainment and other services that rely on social interaction, remain in serious difficulty and their recovery prospects are highly uncertain.  While we can&rsquo;t keep every firm and job alive, I believe our emphasis should still be to preserve these insofar as we can.</p>  <p>  The July stimulus package to be announced shortly, will be radical, of scale and far-reaching. In considering the analyses, I see five areas in which we should focus on in helping our enterprises in the future.</p>  <p>  1. Income supports for workers</p>  <p>  2. Direct grants for businesses</p>  <p>  3. Cheaper finance</p>  <p>  4. New opportunities for future jobs</p>  <p>  5. Support for the hardest hit sectors  </p>  <p>  The July Stimulus is aimed at helping firms meet the fixed, non-wage costs incurred during lockdown and in re-opening.  Our current Restart Grant is a significant help but it could be improved to widen and deepen the impact for businesses that are reopening and taking back employees. That is why we are examining all dimensions of the Restart Grant as set out in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  In improving access to finance, there is a need to not only guarantee credit but do so in a way which does not add costs to businesses unduly. As well as this, and looking to the long-term, the important area of seed and venture capital needs strengthening.</p>  <p>  While I have emphasised the importance of preserving existing firms and jobs, the July package should also have an eye to exploiting emerging opportunities and attract high value projects with significant economic benefits. Importantly, the July Initiative must position our economy and firms to meet future challenges. In the near-term, this includes helping companies further in overcoming the challenges of Brexit, but we also need to include measures that build enterprise resilience and help them transition to a low carbon future.  </p>  <p>  The full range of Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is also working with client companies to support the stabilisation of their business  such as the Lean Business Continuity Support and the Business Financial Planning Grant so that they can undertake a developmental programme focused on recovery and growth. </p>  <p>  In addition to the immediate COVID-19 response, Enterprise Ireland continues to strongly focus on supporting companies to invest in innovation, competitiveness and market diversification. This will be vital for recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), which is administered by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of my Department, was introduced to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at county, regional and national level.  The REDF has been an effective instrument of policy particularly as a complement to the Regional Enterprise Plans where it has served as an enabler for projects emerging from that regional collaborative process.  </p>  <p>   My Department&rsquo;s Border Enterprise Development Fund (BEDF), which is administered by Enterprise Ireland, was launched earlier this year and will provide support for collaborative, enterprise capability building projects, to advance entrepreneurship, productivity and innovation in the Border Region.  The aim of the fund is to improve the international competitiveness of enterprise in the Border Region in the context of Brexit and other market challenges, which now also include COVID-19. </p>  <p>   I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government and with all stakeholders, to examine all such appropriate business supports to assist  all businesses impacted by COVID-19 and a possible no deal Brexit.</p></reply>

The findings suggest a reduction in Irish GDP of between 3.2% and 3.9% by 2030 compared with a baseline where the UK remains a member of the EU. This compares with a negative impact of 7% in the no deal (WTO basis) modelled in the 2018 study.</p>  <p>  Of course, both Brexit studies predated COVID-19 which has had a severe impact on Irish GDP with recent forecasts for negative GDP growth in 2020 of around 10%.</p>  <p>  Government has taken extensive action to mitigate the worst effects of Brexit and in each of the last three budgets provision was made to assist businesses to prepare for Brexit. This includes a wide variety of soft and harder enterprise and financial interventions delivered mainly through the enterprise agencies. At entry level, training, mentoring and consultancy advice has been provided leading to financial assistance by means of vouchers, grants, short term liquidity loans and longer-term loans to assist businesses restructure and diversify into new markets outside the UK. </p>  <p>  Customs is another area that we have been actively working on putting in place training programmes as well as the Clear Customs Initiative designed to build sufficient capacity to deal with the new checks, controls and documentation that businesses will need post Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, earlier this year my Department brought forward a &euro;28 million economic stimulus package for the border region since border counties are heavily exposed to Brexit. </p>  <p>  My Department, through the regulatory agencies under my remit, also has ongoing engagement in important regulatory areas such as product certification and standardisation, market surveillance and on consumer and competition issues.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 recognised the potentially disastrous effects of a No Deal Brexit. While we hope the ongoing discussions will be successful, the possibility of no trade deal cannot be ruled out. Budget 2020 made provision for a Contingency Fund to be made available in the event of a No Deal Brexit to help enterprises and sectors most affected. This contingency may well be required in the event that no deal is possible between the EU and the UK and further consideration will need to be given to this in the remaining months of this year.</p>  <p>  While Brexit presents an economy wide challenge, several exporting sectors are highly exposed to Brexit, including the Food &amp;amp; Drinks sector. In 2019, approximately 200 Food &amp;amp; Drinks client companies reported exports into the UK. Of this, approximately 50% are highly exposed to Brexit. Enterprise Ireland is working intensively with this group to ensure that sustainability and growth plans are in place as we approach end of the transition period on 31st December.</p>  <p>  Over the past four years, Enterprise Ireland has rolled out a range of supports to help companies to prepare for Brexit including the Brexit Scorecard, Be Prepared Grant, Advisory Clinics, Online Customs Training, and Act On Consultancy. These supports have been effective in ensuring our Food &amp;amp; Drinks clients have access to all the available information and expertise in order to develop robust Brexit plans. </p>  <p>  The momentous structural shift that Brexit represents will bring additional challenges for our Food and Drink companies around competitiveness, innovation and market diversification.  </p>  <p>  Cost competitiveness is key and Irish companies will face increased competition not only in the UK market but also in the domestic market.  </p>  <p>  Closely related to staying competitive is the real need for companies to invest more in innovation which is a critical component of competitiveness and is also an enabler for companies to diversify into new products and in turn, new markets.</p>  <p>  Working closely with Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland continues to support all Food &amp;amp; Drinks client companies to innovate, compete and diversify their exports in order to support companies to navigate the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit specific supports will continue to be utilised alongside supports focused on innovation and competitiveness such as their Agile Innovation Fund, R&amp;D Fund, Lean Transform Fund and Operational Excellence grants to position companies to diversify their product offering and to reach new markets.  </p>  <p>  It is intended also that the LEOs will continue to offer Brexit measures focused on winning export customers and improving competitiveness through existing measures such as the Technical Assistance for Micro Exporter Grants, the Lean4Micro and Productivity Challenges initiatives.</p>  <p>  The July Stimulus Package will also aid our economy to recovery from the shock of the pandemic and restore confidence and prosperity. I have already said that the Package will be radical, far-reaching aimed at setting our economy on the right course for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the actions we take now, followed by those outlined in the national recovery plan and Budget 2021 in October, will put our economy on the right track to deal with Brexit regardless of the nature of the future trading relationship between the EU and the UK.</p></reply>

The CLRG recommended that amendments be temporary in nature and operational until 31 December 2020, with the potential for extension.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendments to the Companies Act that I am bringing forward on this basis are to: </p>  <p>  - Provide for virtual general and creditors&rsquo; meetings. This is to allow companies to comply with their obligations under the Companies Act while also ensuring they act in accordance with the latest Government health advice. </p>  <p>  - Allow companies to postpone an AGM until 31 December 2020.</p>  <p>  - Allow documents which are required to be executed under seal to be signed in separate counterparts. This is to address the situation where a company seal and its directors and secretary are in separate locations due to remote working. It is a small amendment but one with a practical impact that will reduce the administrative burden on companies;</p>  <p>  - Increase the amount at which a creditor can issue a statutory demand from &euro;10,000 for a single creditor and &euro;20,000 in the aggregate to &euro;50,000. This amendment is intended to support viable businesses and ensure they are not wound up by the Court for relatively low levels of debt.</p>  <p>  - Extend the examinership process to a total of 150 days. The amendment seeks to provide businesses in examinership with additional breathing space as they attempt to restructure and trade through the pandemic. This extension is subject to court approval and in making its determination the court will consider the impact of Covid-19 and the impact any extension will have to the survival of the company and preservation of employment. </p>  <p>  - Codify a directors&rsquo; duty to creditors as a company approaches insolvency. This amendment is based on a recommendation of the Company Law Review Group in its 2017 Report on the Protection of Employees and Unsecured Creditors. It would put the duty owed to creditors on a statutory footing, in line with other fiduciary duties. </p>  <p>  These amendments are considered necessary in the immediate term to address the instant impacts of the crisis. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of a Bill to provide for these proposed amendments to the Companies Act 2014 is being published on my Department&rsquo;s website today.</p>  <p>  As the country moves forward from the immediate impacts of the Covid-19 crisis, it will also be essential that we consider stabilisation measures required in the medium term. In this regard, I have requested the Company Law Review Group examine as a priority the issue of corporate rescue for SMEs and micro-enterprise, given the vital part that such businesses will play in our country&rsquo;s economic recovery.</p></reply>

Helping our SMEs is central to this, given their pivotal role in the economy and employment. This July Stimulus will extend, enhance and add to the existing measures totalling &euro;12 billion in supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses already announced.</p>  <p>  The Restart Grant was launched on 22 May 2020 and is a critically important tool to support small businesses to reopen their doors and get back on their feet. Grant payments available range from a minimum of &euro;2,000 up to &euro;10,000 available. The scheme was devised in recognition of the fact that micro and small businesses were and are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Using funding allocated by my Department to Enterprise Ireland for the Scheme, the Local Authorities are the granting authority in each of their respective areas. The Local Authorities make grant payments to the bank account of qualifying businesses, in accordance with the scheme.</p>  <p>  As of 10 July 2020, 40,506 businesses have applied for &euro;141.7m in grants. A total sum of &euro;94,795,136 in grants has been disbursed to businesses by local authorities to date, in respect of 23,326 applications.  </p>  <p>  A further sum of &euro;15,044,550 is due to be paid in respect of applications which have recently been approved.</p>  <p>  The Restart Grant is, however, just one part of a wider assistance package for business and for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs.  Within the funding available so far, the priority has been to assist those who have suffered most, including closure of the business, but whom will still have incurred ongoing costs.</p>  <p>  Although the Restart grant scheme has been broadly welcomed by those businesses which have benefitted, I am examining how it can be improved to widen and deepen the impact for businesses that are reopening and taking back employees. My officials are examining all dimensions of the Restart Grant as set out in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

The targets are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal equivalent and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.  Retrofitting has the ability to contribute to a number of important goals including - decarbonisation; warmer, more comfortable homes; and job creation and retention.    </p>  <p>  A cross-Departmental Retrofit Taskforce has been established to develop a new retrofit delivery model capable of achieving these targets. This process has been informed by experience from existing schemes in Ireland such as the Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme referred to by the Deputy, consultation with stakeholders and an analysis of relevant international experience. The model is designed to address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas: customer proposition and demand generation, financing and affordability, supplier capacity, and delivery structure. The Climate Action Plan, as part of this process, commits to reviewing and redesigning the existing grant schemes to ensure alignment with Government climate objectives and value for money.</p>  <p>The Retrofit Taskforce report is to be published in Q3 2020 which will inform the future design or retrofit schemes to deliver the ambitious targets as set out in the program for government.  </p></reply>

The technical conditions aim to provide consumers with better indoor coverage while protecting Mobile Network Operators from unwanted interference.</p>  <p>  The price of repeaters can vary depending on the number of services to be covered e.g. call &amp;amp; texts only, data only or calls, texts and data. ComReg advises consumers to consider their needs before making a purchase. A list of manufacturers and installers of these devices is available on the ComReg website, www.comreg.ie . </p>  <p>  However, there is no grant scheme in operation to assist with the purchase of this equipment. </p></reply>

The targets are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal equivalent and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.  Retrofitting has the ability to contribute to a number of important goals including - decarbonisation; warmer, more comfortable homes; and  job creation and retention.    </p>  <p>  A cross-Departmental Retrofit Taskforce has been established to develop a new retrofit delivery model capable of achieving these targets.  This process has been informed by consultation with stakeholders and an analysis of relevant national and international experience. The model is designed to address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas: customer proposition and demand generation, financing and affordability, supplier capacity, and delivery structure. Development of the plan will be underpinned by principles including quality and fairness. The Taskforce is also working to determine the estimated cost of achieving the retrofit targets.  The Retrofit Taskforce report is to be published in Q3 2020. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan also commits to reviewing ways to better target current energy poverty schemes, such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, to those most in need.  Recommendations in relation to the implementation of changes to the scheme will be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  At &euro;146 million, the 2020 budget allocation for energy efficiency in homes and businesses is the highest ever.  This represents a &euro;29 million increase over the 2019 budget. The allocation for schemes exclusively available to lower income households is approximately &euro;60 million. These schemes are available to people in receipt of certain payments including the Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government funds the Housing Adaptation grant for Older People and People with a Disability.

The purpose of the Regulation is to implement measures for the supervision and control of shipments of waste in order to ensure that the movement, recovery, or disposal of waste, is managed in an environmentally sound manner, for the protection of the environment and human health. </p>  <p>  The objective of this system of control on waste shipments is to ensure that not only is waste moved to another country with that country&rsquo;s advance knowledge, but that wastes from the EU are not dumped in less developed countries. It should be noted that 83% of plastic packaging waste funded under Extended Producer Responsibility arrangements is recycled in Europe, predominantly in the UK, Germany, and Poland  with 15% recycled in Ireland and the balance, 2%, outside Europe. </p>  <p>  I am committed to tackling the problems associated with single use plastics and my Department is working to transpose and implement EU Directive 2019/904, commonly referred to as the Single Use Plastics Directive, at the earliest possible date.  This Directive will enable the prohibition of certain single use items being placed on the market including polystyrene food and beverage containers, plastic cutlery and plates, straws and balloon sticks. I am currently exploring what measures, including the possible introduction of levies, will best deliver on this ambition. </p>  <p>  Waste management practices are evolving and changing in response to the Circular Economy Package and the EU Plastics Strategy and I will soon be bringing forward an ambitious new waste policy which will reflect and exceed the level of ambition in the waste and climate areas at EU level. This will help drive innovation to improve plastic recycling quality and standards and to increase domestic waste treatment capacity overall, thereby reducing our reliance and dependence on markets outside of the EU.  </p></reply>

The targets are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal equivalent and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.  Retrofitting has the ability to contribute to a number of important goals including - decarbonisation; warmer, more comfortable homes; and  job creation and retention.</p><p>The administration of energy efficiency schemes funded by my Department is a matter for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  I have however asked for some enquiries to be made on this matter.Unfortunately the information provided in the Deputy&rsquo;s question did not identify definitively which scheme the applicant applied under.  However, based on the information provided, SEAI have advised it would most likely be the Better Energy Communities Scheme as it operates a contract end date of 15 October.</p><p>SEAI are being as flexible as possible given the unusual circumstances we find ourselves in currently, with the goal of a full delivery of the 2020 programme and allocated budget. The team in SEAI are aware of a number of logistical difficulties with some products and are open to discuss options with project coordinators responsible for delivery of contracts. </p><p>The job of the project coordinators under the Communities scheme is to ensure delivery within the terms and conditions and they get a fee for this service. The project coordinators therefore have full responsibility for logistical arrangements.  To date the Energy Agency through which the applicant applied has not indicated to SEAI that they have any difficulty with delivery of the project.  SEAI have advised that the applicant should contact their project coordinator regarding this matter.  Should they have an issue in this regard they should raise it with SEAI.  <font color="#1F497D"> </font></p></reply>

On Monday 29 June, driving tests resumed on a gradual basis for trucks, buses and motorcycles. Fourteen driving test centres reopened initially, but as the number of tests and categories of vehicles being tested increases in the coming weeks, the remaining 38 test centres will reopen. The RSA will update its website, rsa.ie to advise on each centre as they re-open. </p>  <p>  Following the publication by Government of a revised Phase 3 roadmap for reopening Ireland, driving tests for cars, vans and minibuses are now expected to resume on 16 July on a phased basis. The RSA will prioritise tests for those who are in the emergency services and who contacted them during the suspension of the service. Initially, only those who are frontline healthcare workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot. </p>  <p>  It should be understood that there will be pressure on the available capacity when driver testing resumes. It must also be borne in mind that for all categories, at least for the initial resumption, it is almost certain that fewer daily tests will be conducted by each driver tester. Therefore, while there will be some availability for urgent tests, the RSA&rsquo;s capacity to make these available to all cases will be limited. The RSA will keep the position under review as they move through the service resumption. The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time. </p></reply>

Formal meetings took place between the Department and the CTTC on: 20/05, 27/05, 03/06, 10/06 and 26/06 and a further meeting is scheduled for 17 July. There has also been extensive informal engagement with the commercial bus sector both by the Department and by the National Transport Authority (NTA).</p>  <p>  From my Department's engagement with their representatives, and indeed from the NTA's regular engagement with them throughout the crisis, I understand the very difficult business environment that the commercial bus operators are now dealing with.  Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.</p>  <p>  It is critical for the sector to be functioning so that it can carry the passengers that we need to return to work and to other activities as they re-open. Many of these operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. </p>  <p>  For that reason, I am pleased to advise the Deputies that on 25 June the Government approved temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector.  These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering funding support through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators. </p>  <p>  This is, of course, additional to the wider programme of Government supports for impacted businesses were introduced, including new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example. Consideration of projects to be included in the July Stimulus Plan will be taken by Government shortly.</p>  <p>  With the commencement of Phase 3 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of fleet. This will help to underpin public transport services provided by both public and commercial licensed operators during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  </p>  <p>  Alongside this change, the wearing of a face covering when using public transport is now mandatory, with the exception of those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to young age.</p></reply>

It is not the role of the NPHET to provide guidance in relation to specific sectors, as a rule. </p>  <p>  A National Return to Work Safely Protocol has been produced under the aegis of the Labour Employer Economic Forum and is the result of a collaborative effort by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The HSA has in turn produced COVID-19 checklists and templates, based on the Protocol, to help employers, business owners and managers to get their business up and running again and to inform workers about what they need to do to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.</p>  <p>  The RSA has developed protocols, as any employer must, to apply the overall protocols to its particular needs, including in relation to driver testing.  In doing so, it was assisted by the overall national protocol and also by the additional templates and checklists from the HSA.  I understand that the National Office of Traffic Medicine was also available to the RSA to assist in its task.</p>  <p>  In anticipation of the resumption of driver testing on 29 June, the RSA wrote to each Approved Driving Instructor on 22 June, advising them of the planned phased return of driver testing.  The Authority included a series of Frequently Asked Questions, which provided details of the protocols being applied to driver testing in order to comply with health requirements in line with Government's Protocol on Returning to Work Safely.  These protocols may assist driving instructors in taking the necessary measures resuming their business safely.</p>  <p>  However, the RSA cannot dictate to driving schools on how they should run their business, or issue medical advice.  It is up to each driving instructor or driving school to protect themselves, their families and communities by adhering to the official Government guidelines on hygiene and social distancing.</p>  <p>  However, I have noted the specific point and concerns raised in this correspondence and I have forwarded the Deputy's question and the relevant correspondence to the RSA for a comprehensive response.  Please notify my office if you have not received a response from the RSA within 10 days. </p>  <p>  I understand that any business which reopens is subject to inspection by Health and Safety Authority, and may face serious sanctions, including closure, if found to be not in compliance with Covid-19 requirements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-14a.431.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400072#WRH05300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166, 173, 183, 184 and 272 together.</p><p>Following the commencement of Phase 3 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of public transport fleet.  This will help to underpin public transport services during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business. </p><p>Alongside this change, it was also decided that the wearing of a face covering when using public transport would be made mandatory.  The Regulations for the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport were introduced under Health legislation on 10 July and came into effect on Monday 13 July.</p><p>Public health advice tells us that face coverings are an important safety measure, especially in interior spaces, but that they not suitable for every individual.  Recognising this, the new Regulations do not apply to children under the age of 13. Reflecting public health advice, the Regulations also allow that wearing a face covering is not required where a person has a &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo;, and this includes where a person</p><p>- cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress, </p><p>- needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating, </p><p>- removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, or </p><p>- removes the face covering to take medication.</p><p>The NTA is engaging with public transport operators regarding implementation of the Regulations. The NTA is also making arrangements for an easy and discreet way for vulnerable people who have a reasonable excuse for not wearing a face covering to communicate this with relevant public transport staff.  It will be a voluntary arrangement for passengers who wish to use it, and will be similar to the recently-introduced JAM (just a minute) card. </p><p>The Regulations are implementable by a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; who is defined as any officer, employee or agent of a public transport operator or of the NTA.  A relevant person implementing the Regulations can seek the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where needed.</p><p>Where a passenger is not wearing a face covering, a relevant person under the Regulations may:</p><p>- request the passenger to wear a face covering,</p><p>- refuse the passenger entry to the public transport vehicle, or</p><p>- request the passenger to alight from the vehicle. Failure to comply is an offence and there are penalties (on summary conviction) for non-compliance.</p><p>Operators are already reporting high levels of compliance by passengers. I expect this to grow in the coming days as people understand the importance of protecting their fellow passengers and staff.  It is not intended that enforcement or penalties will be needed often; but they are now available if necessary. </p></reply>

The NTA also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) which now operates under the Local Link brand.  </p>  <p>  My Department provides aggregate funding for Local Link services to the NTA, which in turn allocates the funding to the individual TCUs.

My Department does not provide any Local Link funding directly to individual TCUs.</p>  <p>  I understand that the NTA replied to the Deputy on 29 June explaining that it allocates funding to individual TCUs, rather than on a county by county basis.

However, there are no flight restrictions in place in Ireland, and there have not been any at any stage since the Government first responded to the threat from Covid-19.  This means that the operation of flights remains a commercial decision for airlines. People can still travel if they consider that it is essential to do so and so long as they comply with self-isolation requirements on their return.  </p>  <p>  As things stand in law, air passenger rights are protected by Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, which covers the rights of passenger in instances of cancellations.  For information on the process for escalating complaints regarding refunds for cancellations to the Commission for Aviation Regulation visit www.flightrights.ie. If a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law.  That said, I understand that the main Irish airlines are currently allowing customers who are booked to travel over the summer months to move their flights with zero change fee.  Where flights are cancelled by the airlines, people are entitled to a full cash refund.   </p>  <p>  Under the EU Package Travel Directive, consumers have the right to a refund of all payments where a package holiday is cancelled by the customer or the organiser due to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances. The Government's travel restrictions constitute such circumstances, and advice on this is available on the Department of Transport web site.  </p>  <p>  Whilst consumers are entitled to a full cash refund, they can also agree to accept a Refund Credit Note instead of cash.  If they do, then the State will stand over the cash value of that Note in the event that the issuer goes out of business. If customers are having problems receiving their refunds from travel agents/tour operators they have recourse to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, who can be contacted at www.ccpc.ie or on their helpline 01 402 5555.</p>  <p>  Clearly the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions across the Globe.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.  I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be fair or workable for customers in all instances, and it is something that I will be raising with the industry at the first available opportunity.  </p></reply>

If a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be broken at any time simply by taxing the vehicle.</p><p>Where a declaration is not made in advance, arrears of motor tax must be paid in full and motor tax paid for a minimum of 3 months before a declaration of non-use can then be made in the final month of the tax disc.  </p><p>There are no plans to re-introduce retrospective declarations of non-use.</p></reply>

The NVDF does not hold information on licences issued by other countries. EU driving licences are recognised in Ireland for the duration of the validity of the licence. When the licence expiries, a person resident in Ireland will be issued with an Irish driving licence on application.</p>  <p>  All EU driving licences are exchangeable when a person moves from one Member State to another.  In the case of non-EU jurisdictions, we may make bilateral agreements on licence exchange when the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the two licensing regimes, so that each side can be satisfied that they are compatible and that licences can be exchanged without an adverse impact on road safety on one or other country, due to differing standards.  On the Irish side, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).  As the Deputy will recognise, it is essential that a country with whom we agree to exchange licences have a robust system in place.</p>  <p>  In the absence of a bilateral agreement - which means that there is no recognised standard of testing which people have met - we require people to go through the national driver learning process in order to obtain an Irish driving licence.</p>  <p>  The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland may be able to provide the Deputy with information on the number of persons that are ordinarily resident here but driving on licences from another country, as it is usual to give details of a licence when applying for motor insurance.</p></reply>

Details of the provisional review of fatal collisions for 2019 and contributory factors for fatal collisions 2008-2012 can be found here.</p>  <p>  The road collision database in Ireland is created using a form called a C(T)68 forwarded to the Road Safety Authority (RSA) from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The information provided in this form is based on preliminary information collected at the scene of a collision and does not constitute the findings of the final investigation. The RSA issues reports regularly using the data contained in this database as the best available representation of fatal and injury collisions.  </p>  <p>  The report "Fatal Collisions 2008-2012: Alcohol" is based on an analysis of the completed Garda investigation file where the full circumstances of the collisions are available. Access was granted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the completed Investigation File produced for each collision.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that detailed technical reviews of fatal deaths on the roads can only take place once any other investigation or inquest has concluded and hence there is necessarily a lag between the occurrence of an incident and the publication of detailed statistics.</p></reply>

This is a decision for the National Governing Bodies (NGBs) concerned to consider. I wish to inform the Deputy that an information circular on testing is currently being prepared for the purposes of educating Ireland's NGBs on what these tests are, the role they can potentially play and also to facilitate NGBs in making  an informed decision as to whether they wish to employ testing as a tool. The Expert Advisory Group on the Return to Sport, established by my predecessor and which includes medical personnel from the sports sector, intends to distribute this information circular in the near future.  </p>  <p>  The question of a Government-funded scheme for COVID-19 testing is a matter for the public health authorities and my colleague the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  The Expert Advisory Group has advised - in line with public health advice - that the basic principles of good hygiene practice, hand washing, cough etiquette and social distancing are the most important tools available for the management of this virus. It is recognised that certain sports inherently have social distancing constraints. A sport stratification has been developed to identify low risk and high risk sports in terms of contact. However, the Expert Advisory Group considers that a key message remains that what is done off the field of play is as important as on the field of play. </p>  <p>  The Government is strongly supporting the resumption of sport. A funding package of up to &euro;70 million has been announced to support the sport sector, which has been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The funding package will be administered by Sport Ireland. </p></reply>

However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law.  That said, I understand that the main Irish airlines are currently allowing customers who are booked to travel over the summer months to move their flights with zero change fee.  Where flights are cancelled by the airlines, people are entitled to a full cash refund.   </p>  <p>  Clearly the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions across the Globe.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.  I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be fair or workable for customers in all instances, and it is something that I will be raising with the industry at the first available opportunity.  Clearly, if the industry is seeking to secure State financial support to help it through the current period - which is on of the recommendations from the Aviation Taskforce - then a commitment to fairness and clarity on consumer rights will have to be offered in return, at the very least.</p></reply>

The aim of the fund is to provide Exchequer support for larger sports capital  projects where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount available under the Sports Capital Programme. </p>  <p>  The first call for applications under the LSSIF was confined to National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) and Local Authorities. The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) submitted an application for funding the stadium development project referred to by the Deputy. In January of this year, provisional allocations totalling &euro;77.4m for 25 projects under Stream 2 (construction) of the LSSIF were announced. In view of the limited funding available, the project referred to by the Deputy did not score sufficiently highly to warrant a provisional allocation in this first set of allocations.  </p>  <p>  The evaluation procedures and guidelines for the LSSIF provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the projects being suggested for funding undergo a further process of due diligence. This process includes a further review of projects including economic appraisals and feasibility studies as appropriate to comply with the Public Spending Code and EU State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  In view of the fact that the proposed development had received previous government support, it was agreed that the application in question should also be subject to the due diligence process and the question of funding could then be further considered. This process has been advancing in consultation with the FAI. On 7th May, the Department of Transport , Tourism and Sport wrote to the FAI to confirm that it was satisfied that the multi-criteria analysis was compliant with the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport subsequently wrote to the FAI on 15th June 2020 seeking further information in respect of the financial projections for the project. A response was received from the FAI on the 1st July and is currently being examined. A decision on any possible funding for the project is expected after this material has been fully reviewed.</p></reply>

The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023.

In this context, the NTA has been engaging directly with both public service obligation (PSO) and commercial transport operators.  My Department has also been also engaging directly with commercial bus operators to help inform policy decisions in relation to the public transport sector as we progress through the various phases of the Roadmap.  In relation to taxis and hackneys, there has also been direct engagement with the Taxi Advisory Committee who have since been reviewing the situation in relation to the small public service vehicles (SPSV) sector and I expect to consider the output of their work shortly.  In connection with all this, my Department has engaged intensively across Government in relation to progressing a wide range of relevant issues in relation to public transport, particularly focussed on safety, capacity, and financial challenges.</p>  <p>  From my Department's engagement with their representatives, and indeed from the NTA's regular engagement with them throughout the crisis, I understand the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing.  Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.</p>  <p>  It is critical for the public transport sector to be functioning so that it can carry the passengers that we need to return to work and to other activities as they re-open.  Many of these operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery.</p>  <p>  For that reason, the Deputies will be pleased to know that on 25 June the Government approved temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector.  These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering funding support through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.</p>  <p>  This is, of course, additional to the wider programme of Government supports for impacted businesses were introduced, including new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example.  In relation to SPSVs specifically, the NTA has also introduced a range of measures to facilitate their operation, and engaged with the insurance industry also on their behalf. Consideration of measures to be included in the July Stimulus Plan will be taken by Government shortly.</p>  <p>  With the commencement of Phase 3 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of bus and rail fleet. This will help to underpin public transport services provided by both public and commercial licensed operators during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.</p>  <p>  In view of all the existing necessary engagements to address the Covid challenges I have no plans, at this time, to establish an additional administrative structure in relation to Covid matters.         </p></reply>

It is recognised that certain sports inherently have social distancing constraints. A sport stratification has been developed to identify low risk and high risk sports in terms of contact. However, the Expert Advisory Group considers that a key message remains that what is done off the field of play is as important as on the field of play. </p>  <p>  I am aware that some sports, both domestically and internationally, are using testing as a means to aid return to sport.  I wish to inform the Deputy that for the purposes of educating Ireland's National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) on what these tests are, the role they can potentially play and also to facilitate NGBs in making an informed decision as to whether they wish to employ testing as a tool, the Expert Advisory Group is in the process of completing an information circular for NGBs. It is planned to distribute this information circular in the near future. </p>  <p>  The Government is strongly supporting the resumption of sport. A funding package of up to &euro;70 million has been announced to support the sport sector, which has been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Under the EU Package Travel Directive, travel agents and tour operators are required to provide their customers with a full cash refund when a holiday is cancelled due to exceptional circumstances, which of course Covid is.  However, the travel agents and tour operators are having difficulties securing refunds themselves from their suppliers to pass onto their customers, and indeed where flights take place - irrespective whether a travel agent's customer has cancelled - the airlines are not obligated to provide a refund at all.  This is causing considerable financial strain in the sector.</p>  <p>  The State is providing financial backing for a Refund Credit Note scheme, under which travel agents and tour operators can issue credit notes to their customers instead of cash - if the customer agrees - and the financial value of that credit note is guaranteed by the State.  This is a measure designed to give assurance to consumers about the safety of accepting a credit note, and help the industry alleviate the cash flow drain it is experiencing.   The challenge is to ensure that consumer rights are protected and at the same time that viable business and their workers are kept going.</p>  <p>  My Department is maintaining an open engagement with the industry body, the Irish Travel Agents Association, with a view to seeing what else can be done to support the businesses and protect the jobs.</p></reply>

The resumption is dependent on strict protocols being in place for staff and test candidates in order to comply with public health guidelines.  People wishing to take the theory test should check the service through <i></i>, where they can book a test and learn about the protocols which will apply during their visit to the centre.</p><p>On 29 June, driving tests resumed on a gradual basis for trucks, buses and motorcycles.  Fourteen  driving test centres reopened initially, but as the number of tests and categories of vehicles being tested increases in the coming weeks, the remaining test centres will reopen. Driving tests for cars, vans and minibuses will resume this week on a phased basis with tests for essential workers being prioritised by the RSA in the first instance. There are over 52 driving test centres and each centre must be risk assessed before it is reopened. The RSA will update its website, <i>rsa.ie</i>to advise on each centre as it re-opens.</p><p>Inevitably, there is a backlog of both theory tests and driving tests due to Covid 19 and the suspension of services. Due to the social distancing requirements, normal daily capacity will be considerably reduced. This will mean that customers will experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended and the public&rsquo;s patience and understanding in this regard is requested. </p><p>The RSA have assured my Department it is working hard to deal with this backlog &ndash; the Driver Theory Test provider for example will be opening on additional days including Saturdays, (at some centres) and extended hours will also be provided to allow additional capacity for appointments.</p><p>Given that there will be longer waiting times on the resumption of the driver testing service, it is planned that there will be a prioritisation of appointments.

It is important to remember that driver licensing law exists to ensure that people licensed to drive on our roads meet high standards of safety.  The standards for testing drivers are set at EU level.</p>  <p>  As such, all EU driving licences are exchangeable when a person moves from one Member State to another.  In the case of non-EU jurisdictions, we may make bilateral agreements on licence exchange when the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the two licensing regimes, so that each side can be satisfied that they are compatible and that licences can be exchanged without an adverse impact on road safety on one or other country, due to differing standards.  On the Irish side, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).  As the Deputy will recognise, it is essential that a country with whom we agree to exchange licences has a robust system in place. On the Irish side, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).</p>  <p>  The RSA has previously explored reaching an agreement on exchange with the USA.  However, US driver licensing operates at State rather than federal level, meaning that there are 50 licensing systems with widely varying standards.  Agreement with any one State would mean taking into account the exchange relations between that State and the other 49 States. In that regard, it is important to note that not only do systems and standards vary across states, but road safety records vary accordingly and indeed in many cases are more comparable to developing countries than, for example, other EU member states.  The RSA  therefore determined that agreement would not be possible, without undermining the safety of road users in Ireland and indeed across the EU.</p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchange licence, we have no option but to require them to go through the process of obtaining an Irish licence.  This is a matter of public safety.  While many may have a safe driving record, we have no way of measuring this.  </p>  <p>  At present, people with a full but non-exchange licence go through the normal driver learning process, but they can avail of the shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons instead of the usual 12. Some lessons would be useful in helping people to adjust to Irish driving rules and conditions. They also do not have to wait the minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test.  </p></reply>

It is recognised that certain sports inherently have social distancing constraints. A sport stratification has been developed to identify low risk and high risk sports in terms of contact. However, the Expert Advisory Group considers that a key message remains that what is done off the field of play is as important as on the field of play. </p>  <p>  I am aware that some sports, both domestically and internationally, are using testing as a means to aid return to sport.  I wish to inform the Deputy that for the purposes of educating Ireland's National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) on what these tests are, the role they can potentially play and also to facilitate NGBs in making an informed decision as to whether they wish to employ testing as a tool, the Expert Advisory Group is in the process of completing an information circular for NGBs. It is planned to distribute this information circular in the near future. </p>  <p>  The Government is strongly supporting the resumption of sport. A funding package of up to &euro;70 million has been announced to support the sport sector, which has been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Over 500,000 jobs have been directly supported over the period and many more indirectly.  This is considerable coverage and it is noted that the value of payments made to date is over &euro;2 billion.  </p>  <p>  As the public health restrictions are eased, the challenge for the economy and enterprises is evolving. Having regard to the novel circumstances surrounding the re-opening of the economy as well as the need to avoid the risk of forcing otherwise viable firms to close, in July it was announced that the TWSS will remain until the end of August. Work is currently ongoing around how best to support employers into the more medium term. The position of various sectors, including the businesses and workers mentioned by the Deputies, will be taken into account in this process. As stated in the Programme for Government, it is planned that the July Jobs Initiative will set out a pathway for the future of the TWSS. </p></reply>

The scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector.

The incentive applies for the period from 19 July 2016 to 31 December 2021 (having recently been extended by a further two year period in Finance Act 2019). The legislative provisions for the Help to Buy incentive are set out in Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. </p><p>Currently, in order to avail of the Help To Buy incentive, the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) for a property must be 70% or more. In the case of a self build residence, the lender will apply a valuation using the Central Bank macro prudential mortgage rules, which consists of the aggregate of the market value of the land and the estimated costs of construction.</p><p>The scheme as announced in Budget 2017 was limited to persons who had mortgages with a minimum LTV of 80%. However, Central Bank data indicated that a sizeable number of first-time buyers take out a mortgage with a LTV of less than 80%. It was decided to amend the scheme in the Finance Bill to set the minimum LTV at 70% so as to ensure that first-time buyers did not feel compelled to borrow larger amounts than they would have otherwise in order to qualify for the scheme. </p><p>I do not believe that it would be fair or equitable to allow for different eligibility criteria with regard to loan-to-value ratios in respect of self-build properties <i>vis a vis</i>that which applies to all other new build homes.

The scheme was introduced in advance of the EBA guidelines of 2 April 2020.  </p>  <p>  The guidelines stated the following in paragraph 24:</p>  <p>   "The moratorium changes only the schedule of payments. This condition is consistent with the objective of the moratorium to address the systemic short-term liquidity shortages. In order to achieve this objective, the moratoria suspend, postpone or reduce the payments (principal, interest or both) within a limited period of time. This clearly affects the whole schedule of payment and may lead to increased payments after the period of the moratorium or an extended duration of the loan. However, the moratorium should not affect other conditions of the loan, in particular the interest rate, unless such change only serves for compensation to avoid losses which an institution otherwise would have due to the delayed payment schedule under the moratorium, which would allow the impact on the net present value to be neutralised." </p>  <p>  Banks across Europe interpreted the above paragraph in different ways with the results that different schemes were introduced.  Some countries provided for the accrual and capitalisation of the interest.  Others provided for the non-accrual of interest and a number of countries provided for accrual of the interest but not its capitalisation.  As the Deputy is aware, the payment break introduced by the BPFI does provide for the accrual of interest. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, in its letter to Deputy Doherty on 22 June last, the Central Bank stated that the EBA was expected to provide further clarity on the specific issue of interest accrual and it outlined that both net present value (NPV) neutral and NPV negative solutions are possible. The Central Bank also informed Deputy Doherty that the scheme introduced by the BPFI is acceptable within the context of the EBA guidelines. </p>  <p>  In its implementation report published on 7 July, the EBA stated that the report "provides clarification on questions raised in the context of the EBA's monitoring of the implementation of Covid-19 policies".  </p>  <p>  A key clarification is that:</p>  <p>  " There may be a decline in the NPV if the obligor makes use of the moratorium and postpones one or several payments and no interest is charged for the time covered by the moratorium. Alternatively, the moratorium may be NPV-neutral (i.e. no change in the NPV) if subsequently at least one of the instalments is adjusted upwards or added."   </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should note that the Central Bank instructed lenders that customers applying for a payment break must be fully informed about the implications.  This means that lenders should outline if the repayment term of the mortgage will be extended due to the payment break, if monthly payments will increase following the resumption of the mortgage repayments, if interest will continue to accrue during the payment break and the implications this will have for the total cost of the credit, and any other significant matter for the customer when availing of a Covid-19 payment break.  This was done to ensure that borrowers could make fully informed decisions about whether or not to proceed with a payment break.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation. </p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme is one of the main tools with which we are protecting the income of employees who otherwise would not be working. However, whilst I acknowledge the seriousness of the issue you have raised and its impact on those affected, what I cannot do is mandate how temporary payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme are treated in lending sustainability evaluations by regulators and lenders. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Furthermore the banking crisis we faced over ten years ago was fuelled by unsustainable lending. There are now thankfully far firmer regulatory controls and restrictions on lenders. Speaking on this particular issue, on 7 May the Governor of the Central Bank publicly noted that if an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed such that doubt is cast over the sustainability of potential borrowing, it is in the best interests of the borrower and the bank if the situation is reviewed.  </p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) apply here. These mandate that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness. That assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement. The CMCAR also provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement. The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders. Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.</p>  <p>  This overall regulatory framework means a decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Where a formal loan offer is made by a lender, the loan offer may contain a condition that may allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the loan offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  These overlapping and complimentary regulations are designed to protect consumers, prevent risky unsustainable lending, protect the integrity of the financial system and preserve competition in the market. </p></reply>

It builds on data returned to Revenue through the PAYE real-time system and as such is a fully automated solution. The automated solution, which was developed in a very short timeframe in response to the pandemic, is designed around the dates specified in the legislation. These timelines require that employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020 and that employers had fulfilled their PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before 15 March 2020. The 15 March deadline was subsequently revised to before 1 April 2020 by Revenue under its care and management provisions. These requirements are critical safeguards against abuse and exploitation of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the business in question is unable to access the TWSS because it did not file its January, February and March payroll submissions until 24 June, which was outside of the concessionary April deadline. Consequently, the TWSS system, which operates around the legislative dates, cannot calculate the &lsquo;average net weekly pay&rsquo; (ARNWP) amount for the relevant employees, which is the key requirement on which the subsidy payments are based. It is not possible for Revenue to design a solution that facilitate access to the TWSS where statutory filing requirements are not adhered to. </p></reply>

I also acknowledge the need to continue with the reform agenda and this is recognised in the Programme for Government's cross-Departmental insurance agenda. </p><p>In terms of insurance regulatory reform, I believe much progress has been made through the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group. Key legislative reforms include: </p><p>-  The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 to increase transparency</p><p>- Amendments to sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses to challenge fraudulent claims</p><p>- The Personal Injuries Amendment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 to strengthen the role of PIAB </p><p>- The Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 74 of 2007) with regard to new requirements on insurance renewal</p><p>- The Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 to address issues relating to the liquidation of Setanta Insurance</p><p>In terms of reform, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council in December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council by 28 October. The aim is that such guidelines can result in the lowering of award levels and a more consistent application of making awards in courts. I would expect the insurance industry to reflect lower award levels in lower premiums.</p><p>Another important reform is the Consumer Insurance Contract Act 2019 which is due to be commenced on a phased basis shortly. The commencing of the majority of the provisions of this Act will, amongst other things, place an onus on insurers to handle claims promptly and fairly, and reform other aspects of insurance law such as the practice of warranties and replacing the principle of insurable interest.</p><p>However, it is also important to recognise that there is no single policy or legislative measure that will remedy the cost and availability of insurance. There are also many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address matters in this policy space, in particular the fact that Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied or direct insurance companies as to their pricing levels.</p><p>In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that insurance reform is a key priority for this Government and as noted above this is reflected in the programme for Government. This is an issue that I, as Minister for Finance, Minister of State Chambers in my Department and other Ministerial colleagues<b></b>will focus our energies and cooperate on as part of our collective contribution to the Government's commitment to deliver further insurance reforms. </p></reply>

To date, the scheme has provided in excess of &euro;1.9 billion in support to almost 59,000 employers in respect of some 568,000 employees. There are approximately 410,000 employees currently receiving support through the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 places the administration of the TWSS under the care and management of Revenue, which includes ensuring that this significant investment of public funds is properly allocated to eligible employers and employees. In the exercise of this important role, Revenue is conducting a programme of compliance checks on all employers availing of the scheme to confirm that they meet the eligibility criteria, and crucially that employees are receiving the correct amount of subsidy due to them.</p>  <p>  In order to verify eligibility, Revenue is asking employers to summarise the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on their business, the basis on which they reasonably anticipated a reduction of 25% or more in their turnover in Quarter 2 of this year, and whether the expected level of reduction actually occurred. I assume that the questionnaire referred to by the Deputy relates to this information request.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, where a business had a reasonable basis for projecting a minimum 25% decrease in turnover, but ultimately suffered a lesser reduction in trade, it will require that employer to exit the scheme on a prospective basis, but will not seek retrospective repayment. However, where a business was clearly not eligible for the scheme or failed to pay the correct level of subsidy to its employees, or abused the scheme in any other way, there will be a requirement to repay the funds received.  Revenue has also advised me that any identified abuse of the TWSS will also lead to a more in-depth examination of the employer&rsquo;s overall tax position.</p>  <p>  TWSS payments to employees are liable to both income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) by the employee. These amounts are not being collected in real-time through the PAYE system but will instead become liable by the employee at year end and will be calculated by Revenue as part of the &lsquo;End of Year Review&rsquo; process. However, the level of tax and USC due by any employee may be reduced or eliminated by the amount of unused tax credits available. Any liability due may also be further reduced if the employee has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset. Revenue has also very recently placed all recipients of the TWSS (and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment) on the &lsquo;week 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of 2020 to &lsquo;preserve&rsquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any tax or USC liabilities that arise. </p>  <p>  Revenue has also assured me that if any tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with the employees impacted upon to collect the outstanding liabilities over an extended period. This will be achieved by reducing their tax credits for future years, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible. </p></reply>

The launch was held in Iveagh House, and it was attended by a large number of executives and financial sector leaders from across the industry. A number of guests travelled from many different locations abroad for the launch. It attracted extensive media coverage, both domestically and internationally.</p>  <p>  During the following months, the Minister of State undertook a number of visits to key global markets to launch the Strategy and to further promote Ireland as a top-tier location of choice for specialist international financial services. His itinerary included Brussels, London, New York, Hong Kong and Tokyo. It included engagements with senior executives in firms across a range of financial services sectors in each city. </p>  <p>  Since the launch of Ireland for Finance last year, there have been a number of significant financial services investments secured such as: </p>  <p>  -  Fundrock&rsquo;s regional second site in Limerick was opened where it intends to employ 45 people</p>  <p>  -  Rimes decided to establish its first office in Ireland in Cork</p>  <p>  -  Japanese company JRI America Inc. announced that it will further expand its Technology Centre in Tralee, Co. Kerry, creating 100 new jobs over 5 years</p>  <p>  -  Australian company, EML Payments Limited decided to establish a Technology &amp;amp; Innovation Hub in Galway, employing 20 people</p>  <p>  -  Carne, an Irish founded global provider of fund management company solutions to the asset management industry, announced a significant expansion in its Irish operations, creating an additional 250 regional jobs over the next three years in the South East</p>  <p>  -  Opus Fund Services announced its decision to establish a regional second site in Wexford, creating 100 jobs</p>  <p>  -  DMS announced that it is to create 50 further jobs in Cashel and locate several global centres of excellence there</p>  <p>  -  Boston-based Liberty Mutual Group announced that it will create 120 new jobs in Cavan town over the next 3 years</p>  <p>  -  Mastercard announced its plans to create 1,500 jobs in the next three to five years as it significantly grows its new European Technology Hub in Dublin </p>  <p>  -  there were also openings of new or renovated offices by Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group in Cork and Elavon in Arklow</p>  <p>  Other highlights since the launch of the Ireland for Finance strategy include the establishment of a steering committee to oversee the development of the Fintech Foresight Group. This steering committee will be chaired by Brian Hayes, CEO of the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation of Ireland. Fintech is a growth area for international financial services and we were pleased to submit our response to the European Commission&rsquo;s recent consultation on Digital Finance. </p>  <p>  Considerable work has also been done by the Industry Advisory Committee on establishing a Women in Finance Charter and I look forward to further developments on this initiative throughout the year. Research shows that diverse teams can improve the quality of decision-making, reduce groupthink and allow assumptions to be challenged more effectively, and this is why Diversity was included as a horizontal priority of the Ireland for Finance strategy. </p>  <p>  Sustainable Finance was also highlighted as a horizontal priority of the Ireland for Finance strategy and there have been a number of developments in this space also.  Ireland&rsquo;s second Climate Finance Week was held in November 2019 with some 2,000 delegates attending 18 events over the week. All relevant industry representative associations supported Climate Finance Week, including the signing of a statement of intent to support the sustainable finance agenda within their organisations. As part of Climate Finance Week we also saw the launch of a deep dive review of future ESG skills report and the publication of the second Irish ESG State of Play report.</p>  <p>  The fifth edition of the European Financial Forum was held on 12 February 2020 in Dublin Castle. The European Financial Forum is an annual event that showcases Ireland's international financial services environment to an international audience, and highlights the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the development of the international financial services sector. This year&rsquo;s event was another great success where attendees heard from Mary Daly, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Norihiro Takahashi, President of the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan; Francisco Aristeguieta, CEO of International Business for State Street Corporation; and Steven Maijoor, Chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). </p>  <p>  You may recall that under the previous strategy for the development of international financial services, 'IFS2020' launched in 2015, there was an ambitious target of 10,000 net new jobs in the five year period to end 2019. The jobs figures as reported by the agencies, IDA and Enterprise Ireland, indicate an increase of approximately 11,500 net new jobs over the lifetime of the IFS2020 strategy to end-2019 meaning the strategy achieved additional 1,500 new jobs over the estimate. I am also pleased to report that one-third of these jobs are located in the regions outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  A draft Ireland for Finance Action Plan for 2020 was compiled in December 2019 but was not published before the General Election was called. As you will know, the Ireland for Finance strategy was included in the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for 2020 will also be considered by the recently appointed Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Jack Chambers TD, in light of developments such as Covid-19. We expect to bring the Ireland for Finance Action Plan for 2020 to Government for a decision in the near future.</p>  <p>  We expect that Action Plan 2020, and those that follow, will be informed by the important work that the Ireland for Finance team have been carrying out with the European Commission and DG FISMA on FinTech and Sustainable Finance. The Commission is due to publish new strategies for both areas before the end of 2020 and as part of the consultation process, the Department of Finance has carried out a comprehensive engagement with all of the relevant stakeholders for these sectors in Ireland. The aim of this work has been to ensure that the international financial services sector in Ireland is best placed to respond to the job creation opportunities that the transition to a more digital and climate resilient future will present. By aligning the work of Ireland for Finance with the work of the Commission, the Department of Finance is positioning the sector to play an important role in the recovery of the economy, as a source of resilient and growing employment. </p></reply>

In general, the reduced rate of VAT (13.5%) currently applies to accommodation, certain recreational activities and supplies of food and drink in restaurants, excluding alcohol and soft drinks.  </p>  <p>  Under EU VAT law, Member States may only have two reduced rates which cannot be higher than 15% and no lower than 5%. These lower rates can only be applied to a prescribed list of services in Annex III of the VAT Directive 2006/112/EC. Ireland currently has two reduced rates, 9% and 13.5%. In order to introduce a new reduced rate, one of the current reduced rates would have to be removed. In general, the VAT rate on accommodation, certain recreational services, such as amusement parks, fairgrounds, cinemas, etc., can be reduced to a rate no lower than 5%. The provision of food and drink in restaurants can also be reduced to a rate no lower than 5%, with the possibility to excluding alcohol and soft drinks.</p>  <p>  Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive, also maintains several standstill provisions and derogations that allows it to maintain reduced rates, zero rates and exemptions to certain supplies for historical reasons.

Such relief is permitted where the goods are imported by or on behalf of State bodies, public bodies and other bodies governed by public law, disaster relief agencies and organisations approved by Revenue including organisations regulated by the State and involved in the care, support and treatment of people at risk of COVID-19 and there is no scope to extend this. The goods must be distributed or made available free of charge to the persons affected by or at risk from or involved in combating the COVID-19 outbreak by the bodies and organisations referred to above. The relief is scheduled to end on 31 July 2020 but there is provision for an extension if this is required following a review and consultation with Member States. An extension of 3 months is currently being considered.</p>  <p>  Following a request from my Department, Revenue has also implemented, on an administrative basis, the application of the zero rate of VAT to the domestic supply of certain goods as necessary to combat COVID-19 (including personal protective equipment)  when supplied to hospitals, nursing homes, GP practices and the like, for use in the delivery of COVID-19 related health care services to their patients.  This concessionary treatment will apply until 31 July, subject to review. The scope of the relief corresponds with the relief on the importation of these goods by the bodies specified in the Commission Decision.  </p>  <p>  Any further extension of zero rating to cover supplies of personal protection equipment would require a change in legislation at EU level; the VAT Directive would not permit a legislative measure for the application of the zero rate of VAT to such supplies and there are no grounds in the Commission Decision that would support the adoption of such a measure, even on a temporary basis. </p></reply>

The ambition of the scheme is to ensure the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once the crisis has passed. </p>  <p>  The TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, eligible employers can participate in the scheme in respect of any eligible employees on their payroll, including rehired staff who were temporarily laid off.  Eligibility for the scheme can be satisfied by an employer once they meet the relevant criteria, which can be at any point in time during the scheme&rsquo;s duration. </p>  <p>  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay of the employee as reported to Revenue for January and February 2020. With regard to the subsidy amount, there is no distinction made between businesses who closed due to the restrictions and businesses who continued to trade, with employees continuing to work full time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I cannot comment on any specific employer that may have been mentioned in information supplied with his question. I can say, however, that the TWSS has no role in relation to the employer / employee relationship in so far as terms, conditions, entitlements and rights of the employment are concerned. Consequently, the operation and management of redundancy is a matter between the employer and employee concerned and is outside the remit of the TWSS.</p></reply>

Credit unions account for approximately one third of the consumer credit market and are well positioned to provide access to credit to support the recovery from the current crisis.  </p>  <p>  The economic outlook arising by virtue of COVID-19, including reduced demand for new lending, has increased the challenges the sector is already facing. As a result it was agreed that the CUAC would report to me on challenges and opportunities for the sector, incorporating implications of COVID-19, the role credit unions could play in the economic recovery and any relevant recommendations. I understand that this report is almost complete and will be submitted to me in the coming days.</p>  <p>  There are several commitments in the Programme for Government relating to credit unions, which will be expanded upon in the coming weeks and months as the new Government beds down, taking into account work already completed such as the CUAC report noted above and a separate CUAC report on directors finalised in February 2020. </p>  <p>  Since 2004, the amount of the Industry Funding Levy payable by a credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of its total assets as at 30 September of the previous year. The balance of regulatory costs has been funded by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1942 (as amended). The cost of regulating the credit union sector has increased over recent years with the emergence of the necessity to increase the intensity of supervision of this sector. In 2018, the credit union sector contributed &euro;1.7 million (circa 9% of the total costs incurred in regulating the sector). </p>  <p>  During 2019, I approved the Central Bank request to recover 50 per cent of credit union costs on a phased basis, starting with a 20% recovery rate for the 2019 levy, which will be levied on an arrears basis in 2020, moving to 35% in 2020 (levied in 2021) and to 50% in 2021 (levied in 2022). </p>  <p>  In response to the Central Bank's request, I also recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50% target until: 1) the levy trajectory has reached the planned 50 per cent rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and 2) a public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50% is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector. </p>  <p>  Given that all other financial services sectors are at, or moving towards, 100% recovery, the move towards 50% in respect of credit unions, with further increases at that time being subject to consultation and Ministerial approval, is measured and takes account of the role that credit unions play in Irish society. Exemptions from levies result in a burden on the tax payer through state subvention.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, held a public consultation in 2019 on potential changes to the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund Levy. Following this review, I announced on 1 October 2019 a reduction in the levy rate which will result in a reduction of &euro;4 million per annum from &euro;9 million in 2019 to &euro;5 million from 2020, or 44% reduction. My Department is also currently carrying out a review of the Stabilisation Levy which will be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  In relation to regulatory reserves, adequate reserves (capital) support a credit union&rsquo;s operations, provide a base for future growth and protect against the risk of unforeseen losses. The minimum regulatory reserve to be maintained by all credit unions under Central Bank regulations is 10% of the assets of the credit union. Credit unions had average reserves of 16% as at December 2019. Given the current reserves position of credit unions, the level of the minimum regulatory reserve requirement does not represent an impediment to growth in credit union lending.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank informs me that the current reserve requirement for credit unions is a reflection of a number of factors including: available sources of reserves (retained earnings); the need for individual credit unions to have the capacity to absorb potential losses; and the business model currently operated by credit unions, which is predominantly focused on the provision of short-term personal lending. In setting the minimum regulatory reserve requirement, the Central Bank are mindful of the financial resilience of the sector, members confidence and the protection of members' funds.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note, however, that one of the &ldquo;Additional Observations&rdquo; contained in a 2019 Peer Review Report of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Performance of its regulatory functions in relation to credit unions - undertaken by the International Credit Union Regulators&rsquo; Network (ICURN) - suggests that the Registry of Credit Unions conduct additional stress-testing on regulatory reserves under the existing leverage ratio and risk-weighted reserve approach. The Registry of Credit Unions has advised me that it will consider this suggestion as it plans its work around implementation of the Peer Review Team&rsquo;s recommendations. The Central Bank informs me that introducing a risk weighted approach could place a disproportionate burden on individual credit unions involving a requirement for system enhancements and a level of new expertise with associated cost impacts for individual credit unions. </p>  <p>  Credit unions already have the ability to improve their loan to asset ratio, including through additional consumer lending, mortgage and SME lending, either individually or through collaborative efforts. Following recent revisions to Central Bank lending regulations, the sector currently has capacity to lend an additional &euro;1.1 billion for mortgage and SME lending collectively, with further additional lending capacity available to credit unions which can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank.  As at end 2019, credit unions had a mortgage and SME loan book of approximately &euro;300 million. </p>  <p>  As part of the Government's COVID-19 supports, it is proposed to revise the Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS). The scheme is a Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation (DBEI) scheme, operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), and is already available for banks, non-banks and credit unions to participate in, subject to certain conditions. Officials from DBEI, SBCI and my Department have been and will be available to discuss the CGS and other State financing supports with banks, non-banks and credit unions. </p>  <p>  I and my officials will continue to engage constructively to assist credit unions in delivering new services to their members, including potential involvement in the CGS and Government initiatives in relation to retrofitting.   </p></reply>

Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages. In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the PUP scheme are subject to income tax.  However, following the general taxation rule for social welfare benefit, payments under the PUP scheme are exempt from the USC and PRSI charges. </p>  <p>  The PUP payments are not taxed in real-time. Thus, self-employed taxpayers must complete and return their annual income tax return (Form 11) by 31 October in the following tax year and pay the tax due in respect of PUP payments when making their annual income tax payment. Revenue advises me that it will pre-populate the Form 11 with details of the cumulative PUP payment amounts paid to self-employed taxpayers.  </p>  <p>  In cases where the tax liability for the PUP payments exceeds unused personal tax credits for 2020, the level of tax due by the person may be reduced or eliminated by the amount of unused tax credits available to him or her at the end of the year.  Any liability due may also be further reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset.   </p>  <p>  Revenue advises me that the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on a range of factors, including a person&rsquo;s civil status, their available tax credits, the amount received under PUP, as well as other entitlements and credits, such as health expenses. As there are considerable differences in each person&rsquo;s tax circumstances, it is not possible to provide details of the estimated undercharges arising from the taxation of payments under the PUP, nor to estimate the numbers of individuals who may have such undercharges. These details will not be available with any degree of accuracy until after the year end.</p></reply>

The OMSP is determined by reference to the vehicle model, level of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, level of Nitrogen Oxide emissions, mileage, condition of the vehicle, and any special features or characteristics. Different levels of VRT apply to electric and hybrid cars. An additional VRT charge may arise in the case of late registration of an imported vehicle. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that extensive material is available on its website at link; <i>www.revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-vrt/calculating-vrt/index.aspx</i>regarding all aspects of VRT, including the methodology used to value vehicles (for VRT purposes).

Firstly, it is open to a person who has paid the VRT but who disagrees with the valuation applied, to appeal the decision directly to Revenue. Such &lsquo;first stage&rsquo; valuation appeals are dealt with by Revenue&rsquo;s Central Vehicle Office and customers (appellants) have two months after the date of registration of the vehicle to make such an appeal in writing. Appeals should be made via Revenue&rsquo;s on-line enquiry system at link; or in writing to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, VRT Appeals, Government Offices, Anne Street, Wexford Y35 E29K.</p><p>The &lsquo;first stage&rsquo; appeal consists of a re-examination of the valuation by a Revenue official who was not involved in the original decision. In considering an appeal, Revenue will take account of any additional information provided by the appellant and will also consider issues such as the condition of the vehicle. Where the appellant remains dissatisfied after Revenue&rsquo;s &lsquo;first stage&rsquo; determination, s/he can apply to have the case heard by the independent Tax Appeals Commission (TAC). The appellant must submit a Notice of Appeal directly to the TAC within 30 days of receiving Revenue&rsquo;s &lsquo;first stage&rsquo; decision.  </p><p>The TAC can be contacted by email at info@taxappeals.ie or by telephone at 01-6624530.</p></reply>

In the context of the reopening and the safety protocols involved, all of the Centres have fewer opportunities to increase their services as they would have done prior to the closure.

In addition to this, matters of liability fall under the remit of the Department of Justice and my colleague the Minister for Justice.</p><p>Having noted this, in my remit as Minister for Finance I do appreciate that many businesses operating in the new environment have genuine concerns regarding whether they will have insurance cover for claims relating to COVID-19. Whether a business&rsquo;s insurance provides cover for such claims will depend on the specifics of the business&rsquo;s insurance policy, and it is possible that some policies may cover such claims, but it is also likely that others will not. In addition, on renewal it is possible that many insurers will change their terms and conditions to exclude any future claims for COVID-19.  In this regard, it should be noted that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the decisions of insurers in relation to the provision of such cover. </p><p>With regards to the Deputy&rsquo;s point that individuals may claim against businesses if they allege that they have contracted COVID-19 on their property, I am not aware of any such personal injury claims being made and therefore cannot comment on this. At this juncture, I would like to emphasise that while it may be possible for a claim to be made, it may well be the case that it would be difficult to prove where a person specifically caught the virus in the first place. Therefore, taking such actions may not be straightforward, and even if initiated, there can be no guarantee of a successful outcome. </p><p>For now, I believe that the best way that a business can protect itself from litigation is to follow public health guidelines and implement social distancing measures and this is also true for all individuals in terms of their own health. Furthermore, I would urge all workplaces to review the COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers as set out in the &lsquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol&rsquo; (<i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/22829a-return-to-work-safely-protocol/</i>), which is the result of a collaborative effort by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.</p></reply>

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within Annex III of the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates of VAT. The &ldquo;use of sporting facilities&rdquo; is specifically listed in Annex III which therefore allows Ireland to apply the second reduced rate, currently 9%. </p>  <p>  Services consisting of the care of the human body supplied in the course of a health studio business or similar business, such as a yoga studio, are not listed in Annex III and therefore would in general be subject to the standard rate. However, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%, to the services of yoga studios.  This is known as a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo; and the continuation of this reduced rate application is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%. Therefore, there is no discretion under the Directive to apply the 9% rate to these services.</p></reply>

To date, the scheme has provided almost &euro;2 billion in support to over 61,000 employers in respect of some 600,000 employees. There are approximately 405,000 employees currently receiving support through the scheme.  The TWSS is available to employers across all sectors, including SMEs. </p>  <p>  The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 places the administration of the TWSS under the care and management of Revenue. This responsibility includes ensuring that the very significant investment of public funds is properly allocated to eligible employers and employees. In the exercise of this important role, Revenue is conducting a programme of compliance checks on all employers availing of the scheme to confirm that they meet the eligibility criteria and, crucially, that the monies involved are being properly paid out to employees. These compliance checks, of which approximately 5,000 have already issued to employers, will be completed over the next few months. </p>  <p>  In order to verify TWSS eligibility, Revenue is asking employers to summarise the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on their business, the basis on which they reasonably anticipated a reduction of 25% or more in their turnover or in customer orders during Quarter 2 of this year, and whether the expected level of reduction actually occurred. Where a business had a reasonable basis for projecting the 25% decrease in turnover, but ultimately suffered a lesser reduction, Revenue will require it to exit the scheme on a prospective basis only. </p>  <p>  However, where a business was clearly not eligible for the scheme or failed to pay the correct level of subsidy to its employees, or abused the scheme in any other way, there will be a requirement to repay the funds received. Any identified abuse of the TWSS will also lead to a more in-depth examination of the employer&rsquo;s overall tax position. Revenue is also requesting copies of employee payslips from employers as part of the compliance checks to ensure that employees are being fairly treated and TWSS funds are being paid out as intended. </p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that these compliance checks are not tax audits of business accounts as suggested by the Deputy.

This condition is consistent with the objective of the moratorium to address the systemic short-term liquidity shortages. In order to achieve this objective, the moratoria suspend, postpone or reduce the payments (principal interest or both) within a limited period of time. This clearly affects the whole schedule of payment and may lead to increased payments after the period of the moratorium or an extended duration of the loan. However, the moratorium should not affect other conditions of the loan, in particular the interest rate, unless such change only serves for compensation to avoid losses which an institution otherwise would have due to the delayed payment schedule under the moratorium, which would allow the impact on the net present value to be neutralised.&quot; </p><p>Banks across Europe interpreted the above paragraph in different ways with the results that different schemes were introduced.  Some countries provided for the accrual and capitalisation of the interest.  Others provided for the non-accrual and a number provided for accrual of the interest but not its capitalisation.</p><p>Subsequently, in its letter to Deputy Doherty on 22 June last, the Central Bank stated that the EBA was expected to provide further clarity on the specific issue of interest accrual and it outlined that both net present value (NPV) neutral and NPV negative solutions are possible.</p><p>In its implementation report published on 7 July the EBA stated that the report &quot;provides clarification on questions raised in the context of the EBA's monitoring of the implementation of Covid-19 policies&quot;.  </p><p>A key clarification is that:</p><p>&quot; There may be a decline in the NPV if the obligor makes use of the moratorium and postpones one or several payments and no interest is charged for the time covered by the moratorium. Alternatively, the moratorium may be NPV-neutral (i.e. no change in the NPV) if subsequently at least one of the instalments is adjusted upwards or added.&quot;</p><p>The Irish payment moratorium introduced by the Members of the BPFI complies fully with the EBA Guidelines because, as outlined above, it is NPV-neutral.  </p><p>The payment moratorium introduced in Ireland by the members of the BPFI predated the EBA Guidelines of 2 April.  The meeting on 11 May predated both the clarification provided to Deputy Doherty in late June and published by the EBA on 7 July.  </p></reply>

The scheme is designed to maintain the relationship between employers and employees and minimise the impact on the economy to the greatest extent possible during the public health restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Payments made under the TWSS are income supports and share the characteristics of income and so are subject to income tax. The TWSS is also subject to USC, however, it is exempt from PRSI charges. </p>  <p>  While the TWSS is not being taxed in real-time through the PAYE system, recipients may become liable for income tax and USC at the end of the year, which will be calculated by Revenue through the employee End of Year Review process.</p>  <p>  The level of tax and USC due by any person at year end in respect of TWSS may be reduced or eliminated by the amount of unused tax credits available. Any liability due may also be further reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset. Revenue has also very recently placed all recipients of the TWSS on the &lsquo;week 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of 2020 to &lsquo;preserve&rsquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any tax or USC liabilities that arise. </p>  <p>  Revenue has also assured me that if any tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with the persons impacted upon to collect the outstanding liabilities over an extended period. This will be achieved by reducing their tax credits for future years, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.     </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on a range of factors, including a person&rsquo;s civil status, the available tax credits, the actual amounts received during the year under the TWSS, any top-up payments made by the employer, as well as other entitlements and credits, such as health expenses. As there are considerable differences in each person&rsquo;s tax circumstances, it is not yet possible to provide details of the estimated undercharges (if any) arising from the taxation of TWSS. It is also not yet possible to estimate the numbers of taxpayers who may have such undercharges as these details will not be available with any degree of accuracy until after the year end.</p></reply>

In this context, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  In the context of mortgage applications, lenders continue to process applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The BPFI has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ document which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application. However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit, or temporarily suspend a mortgage approval in principle, is a commercial and contractual decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard. </p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  The CMCAR further provides that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, this was in keeping with the need to get financial support into the hands of affected workers as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The subsidy payments remain liable to income tax and universal social charge (USC) in the hands of employees and will be taxed by way of review at the end of the tax year. Taxation of the TWSS payments is necessary from an equity perspective. The TWSS payments are a wage subsidy and taxpayers in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  Any top up of a TWSS payment by the payment of some element of normal wages by the employer remains taxable through the PAYE system.</p>  <p>  The level of income tax and USC due by an employee may be reduced or eliminated by the amount of unused tax credits available to him at the end of the year.

The PSPR was introduced on 1 January 2011 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act (FEMPI) 2010 and extended on 1 July 2013 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, a three-stage partial reversal of PSPR was provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, occurring on 1 January in each of the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provided for the further lessening of the impact of PSPR in each of the years 2019 and 2020. </p><p>Following these PSPR amelioration measures, since 1 January 2020 the vast majority of public service pensions &ndash; an estimated 97% plus &ndash; are no longer subject to PSPR. A residual group of some 3,000 - 4,000 high-value pensions remain affected (with the majority of these being pre-March 2012 awarded pensions calculated on pre-FEMPI salary rates). </p><p>Section 27 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 states that no later than 31 December 2020, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will issue an order that will specify a date for the removal of PSPR from that residual group of PSPR-affected pensions. </p><p>Separate to PSPR amelioration, a pension increase policy with respect to pre-existing scheme pensions, including the Garda pension scheme, was agreed in 2017 under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA) based on the principle of &ldquo;pay parity&rdquo;. </p><p>Under that policy, pay increases granted to serving staff over the course of the PSSA are passed on to those pensions awarded under pre-existing public service schemes where the salary on which the pension is based does not exceed the salary of serving staff with the same grade and scale point, after the pay increase has been applied. If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.</p><p>Circulars in relation to this policy (and with respect to PSPR amelioration) have been issued by my Department, the most recent being Circular 19/2019 (available online at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/circular/b5d982-circular-192019-further-instruction-on-the-pension-increase-policy-i/</i>).

This included a further 8% year-on-year increase in the number of requests received by public bodies.  The annual volume of FOI requests has almost doubled since the introduction of the current Freedom of Information Act in 2014, while the past decade has seen an increase of 179% in the annual number of requests received by public bodies.</p>  <p>  In terms of outcomes, 87% of requests decided on by public bodies in 2019 were granted in full or in part.  In only 3% of cases did requesters avail of the review mechanism available to them where dissatisfied with an FOI decision, while only 1% of requesters went on to seek a review by the Information Commissioner.  These figures are broadly similar to what has been seen in previous years.  The Commissioner also noted a significant decrease in the number of &ldquo;deemed refusals&rdquo; coming before him, that is cases where a body failed to issue a decision in time. </p>  <p>  My  Department continues to monitor the operation of the 2014 Act on an ongoing basis, and is working closely with FOI bodies and other stakeholders to resolve any issues raised.</p></reply>

Consideration was given to this practice at the time of the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation and it was decided that, on balance and having sought legal advice, it should be discontinued.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, the Information Commissioner has recently confirmed that pension payments must be treated in the same way as other remuneration to public servants for FOI purposes.  Since as early as 2002, the Commissioner&rsquo;s Office has taken the view that while general information, such as the salary scale that applies to a position, can be released under FOI, the precise amount paid to a named individual in a given year is exempt as personal information.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring transparency to the maximum degree permitted by law.  While individualised figures can no longer be published or provided, detailed information such as the aggregate amounts paid to various categories, methods of calculation, and other details are available and allow for thorough scrutiny of my Department&rsquo;s administration of the relevant schemes.</p></reply>

The Department invited online and written submissions, and social media engagement, alongside a series of workshops and meetings, including virtual workshops in line with public health restrictions, to allow wide-ranging involvement in the drafting of the new policy, as well as consideration of the effect of Covid-19 on our built environment.</p>  <p>  The Policy will be informed by the feedback we received from the consultation phase, with over 150 submissions, as well as by a review of the previous policy. </p>  <p>  It is my intention that a new National Policy on Architecture will play an integral part in implementing our vision for the future, providing policy actions that will encourage best quality in researching, understanding, managing, enhancing and reusing our existing built environment assets as well as delivering sustainable new places and spaces.</p>  <p>  I will, of course, be happy to consult with the incoming Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage at the earliest opportunity in relation to the Policy. </p></reply>

Domestic turf cutting could take place there subject to consent being received from the relevant public authority and consultation with the landowner and turbary right holders, if any. </p>  <p>  For a larger plot of land within the site, the findings of concentrated geophysical and hydrological investigations indicate that any turf cutting there would require monitoring for an estimated period of a year to assess the level of risk of peat failure (bog burst). In advance of any turf cutting taking place in this area, consent would also be required from the relevant public authority and consultation would have to take place with the landowner and turbary right holders, if any.</p>  <p>  It has not been possible to undertake any further scientific investigations within the site due to site access issues. My Department is willing to try to bring a resolution to outstanding issues.

These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF), both of which accept applications for conservation works to eligible farmhouses and other buildings in rural areas.</p>  <p>  This year 450 heritage projects across every county in the country will benefit from a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under these schemes.  This funding will support the owners and custodians of historic and protected structures as they carry out hundreds of small-scale, labour-intensive projects to repair and safeguard our built heritage as well as providing vital support for local jobs in conservation, traditional skills and construction.  Details of all projects approved for 2020 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website as well as on each local authority website.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Heritage Council, which is an agency of my Department, in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, manages the Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) for traditional farm buildings. The principal objective of this scheme is to ensure that traditional farm buildings and other related structures that contribute to the character of the landscape, and which are of significant heritage value, are conserved for active agricultural use. Grant amounts under this scheme vary between &euro;4,000 and &euro;25,000. I understand that the 2020 scheme closed for applications on 18th February , but further information can be sought from the Heritage Council directly.  </p>  <p>  While the primary responsibility to care for and maintain a protected structure rests with the owner, these schemes invest essential capital in our valuable built heritage and help the owners and custodians of historic structures in every local authority area across the country to safeguard their properties into the future for the benefit of communities.</p></reply>

The Government operates two universal supports for all sectors. </p><p>-  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, (TWSS) operated by the Revenue Commissioners, has been extended to 31 August 2020.  The TWSS allows employers to retain the link with employees so that when this crisis passes, people can get back to work as quickly and seamlessly as possible. </p><p>-  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The PUP has been extended to 10 August 2020. </p><p>The third phase of lifting the public health restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus took effect from 29 June 2020, when museums, galleries, theatres, concert halls and other cultural outlets were allowed to reopen. Phase 4 of the Roadmap for reopening society and business is due to commence on 20 July, subject to government approval.If it proceeds as planned, pubs, bars and casinos can re-open and gatherings of up to 100 people indoors and 500 outdoors will be permissible. </p><p>Reopening is subject to the Phase 3 and Phase 4 restrictions on numbers public health advice on social distancing. As the country continues to reopen, every step will be guided by scientific evidence and public health advice, including in relation to any restrictions in place. Updates to the roadmap can be found at www.gov.ie. </p><p>Before re-opening, every business and organization must prepare its own re-opening plan as laid down in the National Return to Work Safely Protocol to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures.  Further guidance is available from the Health and Safety Authority as the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace. The HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie.</p><p>My Department has responsibility for initiatives specific to the tourism sector and events and festivals. To this end,  a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was set up  to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023.  Full details including updates may be accessed at this link www.gov.ie/en/publication/8f914-tourism-recovery-taskforce-news-and-updates/.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently published guidelines for the tourism sector in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap and which were prepared in consultation with the tourism industry and relevant authorities. These guidelines are intended to assist tourism businesses meet requirements in line with the Return to Work Safely protocol and based on the latest health advice.

The Guidelines were prepared in consultation with the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport, local authorities and  the National Roads Authority (NRA - now Transport Infrastructure Ireland - TII). </p>  <p>  Planning authorities are required to have regard to the Guidelines in the performance of their functions under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The Guidelines set out planning policy considerations relating to development affecting national roads (including motorways, national primary and national secondary roads) outside the 50-60 kmh speed limit zones for cities, towns and villages.  </p>  <p>  The Guidelines state that local authority Development Plans must include policies which seek to maintain and protect the safety, capacity and efficiency of national roads and associated junctions, avoiding the creation of new accesses and the intensification of existing accesses to national roads where a speed limit greater than 50 km per hour applies.  Planning authorities must also ensure that they consult with TII in preparing any local area plans or other non-statutory plans where there may be material implications for national roads.  I would also note that planning authorities are strongly recommended to identify, as part of the development plan process, those stretches of non-national roads outside the 50-60 kmh speed limit zones where it would also be appropriate to apply the Guidelines. </p>  <p>  The Guidelines do state that, in certain circumstances, planning authorities may identify stretches of national secondary roads where a less restrictive approach may be applied as part of the process of reviewing or varying the relevant development plan.  This includes the form and suitability of development, the volume of traffic to be generated and the implications for safety, capacity and efficient operation of national roads including any future upgrades and consistency with other planning guidelines issued under section 28 of the Act such as the Retail Planning Guidelines 2012 and Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines 2005.</p></reply>

Firstly, before a determination is made, they may make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation.  Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office.  There is also a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates.  However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.  The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p><p>The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas.  Separate legislation governed refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds applied but only 50% of the rates paid were refundable.  With effect from 1 June 2014, when the relevant provision commenced, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area.  The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures)  Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area, shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates.  The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above).  Guidance has been provided to local authorities and elected members in that regard.  A decision to vary the level of rate refund applying is a reserved function of elected members of a local authority.</p><p>The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 modernised the legislation governing commercial rates<b></b>and contains provision for schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties<b>. </b>The Act provides that a local authority may provide a temporary abatement for vacant properties, subject to any maximum relief which may be specified by the Minister, to ensure that all property owners (other than those whose rates liability would be below a de minimis threshold) make some level of payment to the local authority.  The Act allows the Minister to prescribe that the maximum level of relief can be further reduced by individual local authorities.  Currently, only the sections of the Act relating to the amendment of the Rate Limitation Order have been commenced.  Commencement of the remaining elements of the Act is under consideration, and it had been intended that the bulk of the provisions would be operational for the 2021 local authority budget cycle, in November 2020.  However, commencement is likely to be delayed by several months due to the impact of the COVID crisis.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. </p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

As a short term measure, &euro;136m was made available to local authorities as cash flow support in early April, in order to ensure that vital services that local authorities deliver can be maintained.  This support was comprised of the early payment of the LPT allocation ordinarily paid from the Local Government Fund in May and July.  Further to these measures, my Department arranged for the payment of 50% of each local authority&rsquo;s individual Payroll and PSPR allocation, amounting to &euro;54.8m, in mid June.  This interim payment would ordinarily be paid later in July.</p>  <p>  On 2 May 2020, a waiver of commercial rates was announced for businesses that were forced to close due to public health requirements, from 27 March 2020, for a three-month period.  The administration by local authorities of this measure will be by way of a credit in lieu of commercial rates.  The approved Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future, commits to setting out how commercial rates will be treated for the remainder of 2020, as a priority action for the new Government.  This is under active consideration in the context of the July stimulus. </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges faced from Covid-19 there are financial implications to the two authorities arising from the boundary alteration between Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  The Local Government Act 2019, which provided for the boundary alteration, also provided for a financial settlement to be agreed jointly by the local authorities in accordance with a statutory Implementation Plan.  The financial settlement is made up of two parts; an annual contribution, and a financial adjustment that caters for future adjustments.  The annual contribution methodology has been agreed between the two authorities, and is currently the subject of independent audit and verification.  The financial adjustment is also close to agreement and I expect to have final confirmation of agreement in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  A separate provision in the Local Government Act 2019 provided for a recoupment to Cork City Council in respect of income incurred from May 2019 to December 2019.  The transfer of administrative responsibility caused by the boundary alteration took place on May 2019.  Financial responsibility did not transfer until 1 January 2020.  The city took over full responsibility for the delivery of services on 31 May 2019, but the county continued to be the rating authority until the end of 2019.  Agreement on the amount to be recouped is also expected in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Phase 2 is a deep retrofit and focuses on the fabric upgrade works to those dwellings with solid/hollow block wall construction and also provides for replacement windows/doors as well as heating upgrades (including upgrades to boilers, or a heat pump to replace the existing boiler).  </p><p>To date &euro;151m in Exchequer funding has been provided with over 72,000 social housing homes benefiting from upgrades.  A more detailed breakdown of this expenditure is set out on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>Funding support will continue in 2020 for this programme from a budget of &euro;25million, with local authorities selecting their properties for inclusion in the programme and determining the works that are necessary. </p><p>As part of the Just Transition proposals for the midlands region, Budget 2020 made provision for &euro;20 million to fund energy efficiency upgrades to local authority houses in the affected counties as a pilot programme.  The programme is designed to explore an alternative approach to the upgrade of the social housing stock and also aims to group housing upgrades together so that opportunities for retrofitting will arise for private housing with support from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). </p><p>This Programme is being developed under a Retrofit Taskforce and as well as my Department, the preparatory work also involves the Department of Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment and the SEAI.  All involved are working with the relevant local authorities to advance retrofitting in areas of sufficient concentration of local authority housing requiring energy upgrades.</p><p>Significant preparatory work has been completed to date, including a framework for the retrofit works and the identification by the local authorities of their selected areas of housing to be retrofitted.  However, the cessation of many construction-related activities due to Covid has had a significant impact on the work of the local authorities on this programme as essential preparatory work to survey local authority homes for the retrofit works was affected.  </p><p>The adoption by the County and City Management Association (CCMA) of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for internal work to housing, has allowed the surveying work to proceed and as this is completed, it is expected that the retrofit works will commence on some local authority homes in August.</p><p>As set out in the Programme for Government, a national retrofitting scheme is due to be rolled out in 2021. The midlands pilot along with other pilot schemes which are due to commence rollout in early 2021, will be used to test key elements of the national plan. </p><p>The national retrofitting scheme will be managed by a newly designated National Retrofitting Delivery Body which is to be in place by the end of 2020.</p></reply>

Furthermore, under Section 37J of the Act, the Board has an objective to make decisions on applications for strategic infrastructure development within a period of 18 weeks, beginning on the last day for making submissions or observations.  </p>  <p>  Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision.  </p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provided for streamlined arrangements to enable planning applications for strategic housing developments, of 100 housing units or more or student accommodation developments of 200 bed spaces or more, to be made directly to the Board for determination within a period of 16 weeks or 24 weeks where an oral hearing is held. </p>  <p>  The main volume of the Board&rsquo;s workload continues to be normal planning appeal cases &ndash; these cases made up 71% of the case intake in 2019.  69% of such cases were disposed within the statutory objective period (SOP) of 18 weeks in 2019, compared to 39% in 2018.  The compliance rate for these cases for 2020 was 76% (to end June  2020), which is slightly above the compliance target set out in the Performance Delivery Agreement between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Department. </p>  <p>  In relation to strategic housing applications (SHD), despite a tripling of valid SHD applications from 39 in 2018 to 119 in 2019, all decisions made in 2019 and to date in 2020 have been made within the statutory objective period of 16 weeks (or 24 weeks in cases where oral hearings have been held).</p>  <p>  Compliance with the relevant statutory objective period for making decisions on Strategic Infrastructure Development cases (SID) was at 31% in 2019 which reflects the level of complexity and the fact that additional time is often required to conduct hearings and to consider further information. </p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with the Board over the last year or so on a range of measures aimed at increasing its compliance rate with the statutory objective period, including the appointment of Board members and the provision of additional staff resources.  I am satisfied with the impact these measures appear to be having and as such, I have no plans currently to introduce new legislation aimed specifically at increasing the Board&rsquo;s compliance rate. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources to maintain and improve its compliance rate, in line with its Performance Delivery Agreement targets.</p></reply>

A total of 189 applications were received.  The application process was competitive.  All proposals went through a rigorous assessment including consideration by a Project Advisory Board, which consisted of representatives from my Department, other relevant Government Departments, agency representation and independent national and international expert representatives.  On 26 November 2018, URDF support was announced for a total of 88 projects throughout the country, one of which was later withdrawn by the applicant. </p>  <p>  In mid-2019 approval in principle and provisional funding allocations issued in respect of 87 major projects across the country.  This significant pipeline of projects is set to have a transformational impact in urban areas across the country.  The 87 projects approved under Call 1 offer a good regional spread, and span a number of themes.  The diversity of this first tranche of projects demonstrates the broad focus and responsive nature of the Fund.  Through the URDF, successful applicants are receiving targeted integrated support for innovative holistic solutions to the issues that have hindered the regeneration and rejuvenation of our large towns and cities.  </p>  <p>  While the advancement of each project is, in the first instance, a matter for the successful applicant my Department is working closely with them to ensure timely progress.   </p>  <p>  Call 2 was announced earlier this year and the closing date for applications was 29 May.  Seventy six proposals were received, with every local authority submitting at least one application for URDF support.  </p>  <p>  Because of the nature of the URDF programme the proposals are very complex, and each will require detailed assessment.  The assessment process will take place over the coming months with the intention that a new tranche of approved proposals, which will augment the existing pipeline of projects from Call 1 and contribute to the achievement of Programme for Government commitments and the objectives of the National Planning Framework and Project Ireland 2040, will be announced later in the year.</p></reply>

Persons who make submissions are also entitled to be notified of any significant further information provided to the planning authority by the applicant and to be notified of the authority&rsquo;s decision on the application.  Furthermore, any person who made a submission on a planning application may appeal the planning authority&rsquo;s decision on the application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la or may make a submission to the Board in relation to an appeal of that decision.</p>  <p>  The fees payable by members of the public to participate in the planning decision-making process are set at a level that, as well as contributing towards the cost of processing applications and appeals, discourages frivolous or vexatious submissions without hindering genuine public participation.  In addition, the Board has discretion to dismiss an appeal where it is satisfied that the appeal is vexatious, frivolous or without substance or foundation, or where the appeal is made with the sole intention of delaying development or of securing the payment of money, gifts, considerations or other inducement by any person.  Furthermore, where a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la has suspicions that specific submissions on planning applications or appeals may not be genuine, it is a matter for them to refer the submissions to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current arrangements in relation to public participation in decision-making contribute significantly to the openness and transparency of the planning process, and I have no proposals to amend the legislation in this regard.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities. Part V homes are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration. </p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation was undertaken. The review incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. The position of those who were tenants in Part V units prior to the introduction of the regulations is a matter for consideration. </p>  <p>  The review of the Scheme is part of a significant body of work undertaken in my Department in relation to the broader social housing reform agenda. I would hope to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete. </p></reply>

The new Programme for Government sets out clear and ambitious commitments, including funding Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plans of &euro;8.5 billion under the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  I recognise the demanding work that Irish Water, along with its local authority partners, is undertaking to address those issues identified in the EPA report and I have arranged a meeting with the management of Irish Water this week to discuss the report and the delivery of the goals contained in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  In relation to the European Commission&rsquo;s &lsquo;Reasoned Opinion&rsquo;, my Department remains in contact with the EU Commission in respect of this case and the delivery of the ongoing reform of water services in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. The Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024 sets out Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic business planning funding requirement of &euro;11bn to 2024, comprised of a &euro;6.1bn investment in infrastructure and assets, including &euro;1.1bn for water quality, and &euro;4.9bn in operating costs.</p>  <p>  Further detail in relation to the breakdown of Irish Water's capital investment should be sought from Irish Water. It may be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

There is a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group. Strand 1 considered the composition and distribution of funding for the MARWP 2019-2021, while Strand 2 is considering the long-term future resourcing of the rural water sector. The wastewater infrastructure needs of rural villages is an issue that the Working Group is to examine further.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of public water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. Irish Water brought forward proposals for a Small Towns &amp;amp; Villages Growth Programme, as part of its Capital Investment Plan 2020-2024 submitted to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, which will support a number of the National Policy Objectives and National Strategic Outcomes under the National Planning Framework. The Small Towns &amp;amp; Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in its Investment Plan to 2024. Irish Water will work with local authorities across the country in ensuring the investment is made where it is needed most, aligned to core strategies. I understand that Irish Water is currently advancing its proposals on this programme. </p>  <p>  In addition to the support the plan gives to sewered locations in urban and rural Ireland, Irish Water is also prepared to support local authorities who wish to seek funding for un-sewered villages through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund of the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  In July 2019, my Department launched the multi-annual Developer-Provided Water Services Infrastructure Resolution Programme 2019-2021. Bids were sought from local authorities with Developer-Provided Water Services Infrastructure in residential estates in their areas to apply for funding. It is noted Galway County Council included estates in the three villages in the question in its application. An Expert Panel, which includes Departmental, stakeholder and independent representation, has been appointed to examine the bids against the criteria set out in the scheme. I expect that the Expert Panel will make recommendations to me shortly on the suitability of projects for funding under the programme and an announcement on approvals and allocations will be made once that process is concluded in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The project is being undertaken by two Approved Housing Bodies, Tuath and Respond, with the assistance of DLR County Council. The mixed-tenure development comprises 50 Cost Rental homes alongside 105 social housing homes. Delivery of the Cost Rental homes is being supported by zero-cost land supplied by the Housing Agency, an infrastructure grant from my Department's Serviced Site Fund, and debt financing from the Housing Finance Agency. Construction began in July 2019 with delivery scheduled for Q3 2021, pre-Covid. </p>  <p>  A second pilot project, sponsored by my Department is under development for a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate). The project is being led by  Dublin City Council. The proposal is for DCC to construct 375 Cost Rental units alongside 109 social housing units. A Development Framework Plan has been completed and DCC has recently appointed an architect-led integrated design team to progress the project through the planning and construction phases. </p>  <p>  Another proposed Cost Rental development, at Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where DLR County Council is working in partnership with the Land Development Agency to develop the Council-owned site.  On Monday, 13th July, planning permission was confirmed for 597 homes on the site which it is intended will comprise 35% social homes, 15% affordable purchase homes and 51% cost rental homes.   While the final cost of rents will vary according to the ultimate cost of provision of the homes, the LDA and DLR County Council are targeting rents which will achieve a significant discount on market rents in the area.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the project at Shanganagh, the Land Development Agency is examining the potential to deliver Cost Rental homes at scale from its initial portfolio of sites and the broader State land bank. This includes sites such as the former Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum  </p></reply>

Under the stewardship of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Fund was established to support more compact and sustainable development, through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan (NDP).  This is to enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns and to ensure that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit.</p>  <p>  There is an Exchequer commitment of &euro;550 million for the Fund to support approved URDF-supported projects and other similar projects up to the end of 2022. The URDF has an allocation of &euro;2 billion in the NDP to 2027 and &euro;130 million is available in 2020.</p>  <p>  As part of the first call for proposals under the URDF Waterford City and County Council submitted a bid for Exchequer grant funding in respect of a major multifaceted project for the North Quays, Waterford, an area designated a Strategic Development Zone.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the largely transport focussed infrastructural works involved will open up the North Quays site, make it more accessible, and ultimately support the achievement of the broader objectives of the SDZ planning scheme.</p>  <p>  On 26 November 2018, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government announced initial URDF support of &euro;100m for a total of 88 projects across the country, including &euro;6m of initial support for the Waterford North Quays Project.  Furthermore, in June 2019, URDF support of &euro;30m was ring-fenced in respect of the advancement of the overall North Quays Project, pending further clarification of the project detail.  </p>  <p>  This is a very complex and high value project in a strategic development zone, and so it is critical that careful consideration is given to its planning and development, and also in order to establish the correct combination of supports required to facilitate its successful advancement and completion.  At this stage, the project composition, costs, sequencing, and requisite supports must be further clarified so that the appropriate level of &lsquo;whole project&rsquo; URDF support can be established. </p>  <p>  While the advancement of the North Quays Project is, in the first instance, a matter for Waterford City and County Council, my Department is continuing to engage with the local authority to assist further progress on the development of this important project. </p></reply>

This is under consideration by my Department as part of the revised estimates under preparation.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to accurately calculate the loss of income from commercial rates in 2020 at this stage in the year, due to the range of payment plans available to ratepayers and the variety of payment patterns from different sectors of ratepayers.  This is coupled with the fact that the second moiety has only been due since 1 July and is payable until the end of the year.

The Programme has two phases: Phase 1- which covers the bulk of the work undertaken to date - focuses on delivering immediate improvements such as cavity wall and attic insulation.  Phase 2 targets higher cost measures, such as fabric upgrades, window and door upgrades and the installation of photovoltaic panels and heat pumps.  To date under the programme, some &euro;151m has been spent nationally, with over 72,000 social housing homes upgraded</p>  <p>  The cost of carrying out an energy retrofit on a social housing home varies considerably depending on factors such as dwelling size, year of construction, dwelling condition and construction type. In 2019 expenditure under the programme was &euro;22.4million with 3,803 social homes upgraded.  This can be broken down further into 2,468 units under Phase 1 with expenditure of &euro;4,916,529, an average of &euro;1,992 per unit and 1,335 units upgraded under Phase 2 with expenditure of &euro;17,512,869, an average of &euro;13,118 per unit. </p>  <p>  The Exchequer funding available to local authorities under the social housing retrofit programme for 2019 was up to a maximum &euro;19,800 for a mid-terrace house or apartment and &euro;22,800 for a property that is end-terrace, detached, semi-detached or a bungalow. This funding has increased for 2020 up to a maximum of &euro;30,100 for a mid-terrace house or apartment and &euro;34,600 for a property that is end-terrace, detached, semi-detached or a bungalow.</p></reply>

The Central Statistics Office analysis of Building Energy Rating data demonstrates this shift away from fossil fuels; electrical systems make up 44% of heating systems in new dwellings with this percentage growing steadily each year. Solid fuel boilers are no longer installed as main heating systems and the installation of oil boilers in new dwellings has dropped from an average of 37% to 4% in recent years.  The installation of gas boilers in new dwellings is expected to follow a similar trend in the coming years as a result of these recently introduced NZEB regulations.</p>  <p>  Similarly, Part L the Building Regulations 2017 has set higher building energy performance standards for Buildings other than Dwellings, in accordance with the Nearly Zero Energy Building requirements (NZEB) contained in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. </p>  <p>  These Regulations apply to works in connection with the design and construction of a new building, where the relevant works commence or take place, as the case may be, on or after 1 January 2019 except where &ndash; </p>  <p>  - an application is made on or before 31 December 2018 for planning permission or  approval pursuant to the Planning and Development Act 2000 and where substantial work has been completed by 1 January 2020; or </p>  <p>  - a notice pursuant to  the provisions of Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 has been published on or before 31 December 2018 and where substantial work has been completed by 1 January 2020.</p>  <p>  These regulations will also support the phase out of fossil fuel boilers in new buildings other than dwellings by advancing the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance requirements to Nearly Zero Energy Buildings standards and by requiring that the nearly zero amount of energy required in new buildings is covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  The performance requirements in building regulations are set at the cost optimal level which ensure that the best energy performance is obtained for the lowest lifecycle cost taking account of capital cost and operating costs. A range of solutions can be used to achieve these performance requirements. The advanced performance requirements in the current regulations combined with a mandatory renewables requirement, is creating a rapid transition to low carbon heating systems in new buildings.</p>  <p>  The cost optimal calculations are reviewed every 5 years and regulations will be amended if performance levels deviate off cost optimal. This regular assessment and flexibility provides opportunities to capture the benefits of innovation and economies developed in industry over time in regulations.</p></reply>

As part of the eligibility criteria applicant(s) of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan must have received insufficient offers of finance from two mortgage lenders to apply for a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.   </p>  <p>  Single applicants for the loan must not be earning greater than &euro;50,000 gross per annum.  The combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than &euro;75,000 per annum.  There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage in accordance with the statutory credit policy underpinning the loan.  With a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, applicants can borrow up to 90% of the market value of a residential property. There is also a cap on the maximum value of the property that can be purchased under the scheme.  In the greater Dublin area, Cork, and Galway, the maximum market value is &euro;320,000. In the rest of the country, this limit is &euro;250,000. </p>  <p>  The availability of the Help To Buy Scheme for first-time-buyers, which is a policy of the Department of Finance, offers additional assistance to purchasers of newly built properties.  Up to 5% of the purchase price of properties below &euro;400,000 could be available, which represents a significant contribution towards these deposit requirements. This should alleviate some of the challenges faced by first-time buyers in accessing the 10% deposit of the market value of the property.  The initiative has been designed to provide immediate and targeted support for first-time buyers in meeting their deposit requirements and encouraging the construction of new housing units. Further information on this scheme is available on www.revenue.ie. </p>  <p>  More generally, there are other proposals to support renters.</p>  <p>  As confirmed in the Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', this Government is committed to the introduction of Cost Rental housing in Ireland. This recognises that renters in Dublin and other major urban centres are facing significant housing access and affordability challenges. Cost Rental is a fundamentally different housing proposal and represents a new tenure option. It is defined as housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only.  </p>  <p>  Initial work on Cost Rental is underway and in 2019 an inter-departmental multi-agency Cost Rental Working Group was convened in order to assess methods for the consistent and sustainable delivery Cost Rental at scale. This work will be assisted by a recently initiated research consultancy sponsored by the European Investment Bank on behalf of my Department. The EIB has extensive experience in supporting the delivery of affordable housing across Europe. The final Report is scheduled for completion in December. </p>  <p>  The first Cost Rental pilot development in Ireland is currently under construction at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown. The mixed-tenure development comprises 50 Cost Rental homes alongside 105 social housing homes. The cost-covering rent for a two-bedroom apartment is projected to be &euro;1,200 per month, which represents a significant discount on equivalent market prices in the area. Construction began in July 2019 with delivery scheduled for Q3 2021 (pre-Covid). </p>  <p>  Two other Cost Rental projects are also under development, at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate), and at Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown. At the former site, Dublin City Council are proposing to construct 375 Cost Rental units alongside 109 social housing units, and they have recently appointed an architect-led integrated design team to progress the project through the planning and construction phases. At Shanganagh, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is working in partnership with the Land Development Agency to develop approximately 300 Cost Rental homes alongside approximately 200 social housing homes and 100 homes for sale under the Affordable Purchase scheme. A planning proposal was lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in January 2020. </p>  <p>  The selection of further sites for cost rental consideration will be informed by emerging policy and by the financial and operational model that will develop from the evidence building that is currently underway. In the long term, the intention is that the development of a Cost Rental model will significantly enhance affordability for moderate-income earners within the rental housing sector.</p></reply>

The Government respects everyone&rsquo;s right on this island to make the case for the constitutional future they wish to see for Northern Ireland - whether the continuation of the union with Great Britain or a sovereign united Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement - and the two sovereign Governments - explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both of these constitutional positions, which are deeply held.</p>  <p>  The holding of a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland. The decision to hold such a poll in Northern Ireland rests with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement is a priority for this Government. The principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland are fundamental elements of the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island of Ireland, North and South. </p>  <p>  Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments &ldquo;recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Britain or a sovereign united Ireland&rdquo; and should such a choice be made in the future, it will be a binding obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to listen to and engage with the views of everyone on this island, both on rights issues and on the constitutional future that they wish to see for Northern Ireland. These are extremely important issues which naturally require very careful and serious consideration and the Government will continue to engage and reflect on them. It is for that reason that the Programme for Government has committed to establishing a Unit within the Department of An Taoiseach to work towards a consensus on a shared island. This unit will examine the political, social, economic and cultural considerations underpinning a future for this island in which all traditions are mutually respected.</p></reply>

These commitments are annexed to the proposed agreement, but do not form part of it.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government&rsquo;s commitments under New Decade, New Approach include working through the NSMC to help deliver infrastructure that will benefit people across the island, to achieve greater connectivity, North and South, and investing in the North West region and in Border Communities, including a total of &pound;75 million up to 2022 for the A5 road project. </p>  <p>  There is also a commitment in principle to contributing to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made in the context of this agreement by the British Government.</p>  <p>  I and my Government colleagues are looking forward to meetings of the North South Ministerial Council resuming as soon as possible, with a full plenary meeting of the Council followed by the regular pattern of Ministerial meetings across the NSMC&rsquo;s twelve sectors of cooperation.  </p>  <p>  These Ministerial meetings will provide opportunities to discuss and to work together with Northern Ireland Executive colleagues on advancing the implementation of the commitments made by the  Government in the context of the New Decade, New Approach agreement, as well as other areas of practical co-operation that are to our mutual benefit.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to playing its full part in the delivery of these projects.  The funding requirement in the years ahead will depend on the timing and details for projects being agreed on a North/South basis, and will need to take account of necessary discussions with the Executive through the North South Ministerial Council, the progress of implementation of each project, and, where relevant, our engagement with the British Government.</p>  <p>  The Government has recognised that the North West region is in particular need of strategic investment.  In this regard, the North West Strategic Growth Partnership, established in 2016 through the North South Ministerial Council, brings together senior Government officials from Government Departments North and South and other stakeholders to engage with Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council to deliver on strategic priorities aimed at bringing real and positive change for the region. </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to continuing to support the work of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership and in the context of New Decade, New Approach is committed in principle to providing further funding of up to &euro;2.5m to the North West Development Fund in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Executive. </p>  <p>  The North West Strategic Growth Partnership will also provide an important forum through which discussions with relevant regional stakeholders can be advanced. </p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision at the Magee Campus to Derry, including in the context of the British Government&rsquo;s  City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund initiative which is being advanced by Derry City and Strabane District Council. This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-14a.1219.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400084#WRV06000"><p>The Government has always been clear that Brexit will mean change. Whatever the outcome of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations, the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union at the end of the transition period. Therefore, even the best possible FTA between the EU and UK will impact supply chains and trade flows and will involve checks and controls in both directions on EU-UK trade. </p>  <p>  With less than six months until the end of transition, work to ensure Government, business and citizens are prepared is of the utmost importance. Yesterday I brought a Brexit Memo to Government including a comprehensive update on Brexit Readiness and Contingency Planning across Government. Given the limited progress in negotiations between the EU and the UK on a future partnership agreement, we have intensified preparations  across all Departments on the basis of two scenarios: (i) a limited FTA (and accompanying fisheries agreement), or, (ii) no trade deal (i.e. a hard Brexit ). While Ireland fully supports the closest possible relationship between the EU and UK, prudence dictates that we approach our planning on this basis. </p>  <p>  In focusing on the two scenarios set out above, we will continue to undertake this work in three distinct but overlapping streams: work for which the Government is the lead; addressing the needs of sectors and business impacted by the UK&rsquo;s departure; and societal and citizen focused issues.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, significant investment has been made in the infrastructure and systems required for the additional checks and controls for trade in both directions with the UK, at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort, as well as at Dublin Airport.  The work at Dublin Airport is now complete.  Substantial work is also complete on a number of projects at Dublin and Rosslare Ports and further facilities will come on line by the end of 2020 to further enhance the capacity already in place.</p>  <p>  The UK landbridge will continue to be of paramount strategic importance to EU operators, especially Irish operators, as a means of accessing the EU Single Market. Working with our partners, progress has been made on addressing concerns over checks and controls on goods moving under transit, including recently in relation to SPS checks under the new Official Controls Regulation. Even with these issues addressed, the way in which traders use the landbridge will change. A communications programme is planned to advise traders of these new processes. </p>  <p>  Brexit comes at a time when businesses and the economy are already heavily impacted by the COVID19 crisis. The Government acted swiftly and decisively in terms of COVID-related supports to businesses. Brexit preparation will necessarily be part of a wider business recovery agenda and we will look at how best business supports can be deployed in support of Brexit readiness. </p>  <p>  Our approach to readiness work will continue to be underpinned by a strong communications and stakeholder engagement programme. Central to this will be supporting business readiness for the new trading environment at the end of transition. I will continue to chair the Brexit Stakeholder Forum, which will meet again in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  On 29 May, the Government approved the preparation of a scheme for a new Brexit Omnibus Bill to  ensure appropriate legislative underpinning of necessary mitigation measures. I expect this Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas in the autumn.</p>  <p>  Preparations are also ongoing at EU level. On 9 July the Commission published a Communication on Readiness at the end of the transition period, focusing on the preparations that will be required for the changes inevitably arising in all scenarios when the UK will no longer participate in the EU's Single Market and Customs Union. The European Commission is currently updating its 102 readiness notices to provide useful advice to businesses and citizens on how to prepare for Brexit. These are available on the European Commission website.</p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, will apply at the end of the transition period regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations. </p>  <p>  Preparing for the change that Brexit will bring is a key priority across Government. This work has intensified and will continue in the period ahead. We remain committed to doing everything we can to ensure that citizens and businesses are as ready as they can be for the end of transition.</p></reply>

A range of factors is taken into account in considering representation overseas, including political, economic, foreign policy, trade and development priorities, as well as the availability of resources. The Mission network performs a wide range of functions in support of Ireland&rsquo;s wider foreign policy interests, including representing and advancing Government policies, in particular in the context of the European Union and at the United Nations, economic and cultural promotion and development co-operation. They work very closely with State Agencies in the promotion of exports, tourism and inward investment. They provide frontline consular and passport services to citizens overseas, engaging with and supporting Irish communities overseas.</p>  <p>  In 2011, the then Government decided that it was necessary to close Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Iran, due to the acute budgetary pressures the country was under at that time. This decision was taken following a comprehensive review of our overseas diplomatic network in which particular attention was paid to the promotion of our economic interests. The Embassy of Ireland in Ankara is now accredited on a non-residential basis to Iran and supports our broad policy objectives, including the development of political relations, trade relations and supporting the needs of Irish businesses operating or hoping to operate there. Ireland is also represented in Iran by an Honorary Consul. Honorary Consuls are an important element of the State&rsquo;s global engagement and provide consular services and assistance, as well as a range of other supports to citizens. </p>  <p>  A decision was taken to close our Representative Office in Dili, Timor Leste in 2011. Ireland continues to have a very strong bilateral relationship with Timor Leste, through our Embassy in Singapore which is accredited to Timor Leste, and through Ireland&rsquo;s Partnership Strategy for Small Island Developing States. </p>  <p>  In 2014 the Embassy of Ireland in the Kingdom of Lesotho was closed following a decision taken in the context of a review of Ireland&rsquo;s overall overseas diplomatic network. Ireland continues to have rich bilateral engagement with Lesotho, including in respect of development cooperation, through our Embassy in the Republic of South Africa which is accredited the Kingdom of Lesotho. </p>  <p>  The network of resident Irish diplomatic Missions overseas will continue to be kept under review, including in the context of the commitment, set out in the Programme for Government, to Global Ireland 2025, and its aim to double the impact of our global footprint, having due regard to available resources.</p></reply>

This Fund mobilises and channels funding to NGOs and UN agencies which have the capacity and are best placed to deliver lifesaving assistance to the most vulnerable. In total Ireland has given over &euro;27 million in humanitarian aid directly to Yemen since 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides significant humanitarian funding to Yemen through our contribution to global funds, including to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund. Ireland is one of the top ten contributors to the CERF since its establishment in 2006. In 2019, the CERF provided &euro;32 million in funding to Yemen. Funding has also been given to WHO and UNHCR specifically for their Global COVID-19 response.</p>  <p>  As a Member State of the EU, Ireland also contributes to the EU response to the crisis in Yemen. Since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the EU has allocated &euro;484 million in humanitarian aid.</p>  <p>  The roots of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen lies in conflict. Ireland and the EU fully support the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, to bring about a political resolution to the conflict. </p>  <p>  In particular, I welcome efforts made towards a Joint Declaration between the Government of Yemen and the Houthis that would commit the parties to a nationwide ceasefire, bring forward a number of economic and humanitarian measures, and resume a political process.  However, despite the Special Envoy&rsquo;s efforts over the last three months, agreement has not been reached and the cycle of violence continues and has even increased in some areas. </p>  <p>  Ireland calls again on the parties to the conflict to comply fully with their obligations under international humanitarian law, and to continue their engagement with the Special Envoy with a view to agreeing a declaration and ceasefire that will be in the best interests of the people of Yemen. Full, secure and unimpeded access for humanitarian and health workers and supplies to all of Yemen, in the spirit of Resolution 2532, would allow lifesaving assistance to reach those in greatest need.</p></reply>

The advice provides an objective assessment of the risks individuals could face if travelling overseas, with a view to helping them to make informed decisions for themselves. It is based on consultation with our Embassies and Consulates on the ground, the relevant local authorities in each country and our international partners, together with our domestic partners where appropriate. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the priority of protecting public health, we have worked particularly closely with the Department of Health and the HSE.</p>  <p>  In mid-March, the Department issued a general advisory for the public to avoid all non-essential travel overseas, and the security status rating for each country was amended to reflect this advice. This advice initially applied until March 29, and was subsequently extended until further notice. The Government continues to advise against all non-essential travel overseas. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will understand, requirements and conditions for entry into the State are a matter for other Departments. However, I can advise that, at the time of writing, all entrants to the State, other than those coming from Northern Ireland, and certain exempted categories, are required by law to complete a Public Health Passenger Locator Form, and to submit it to the relevant authority at their port of entry. They should also restrict their movements for 14 days after arrival. Any further questions on this matter should be referred to the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The Government is considering a roadmap for the resumption of safe international travel, which is likely to include a &lsquo;green list&rsquo; of countries.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that any issues relating to terms and conditions of flights, holiday packages, insurance policies or refunds should be pursued directly with the airline, tour operator or insurer.</p></reply>

Ireland and our EU partners remain deeply concerned about the credible reports of the treatment of ethnic Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, including arbitrary detentions, widespread surveillance, restrictions on freedom of religious belief, and recent media reports of forced sterilisation in the region. We have raised our concerns with China in both bilateral and multilateral contexts, and, along with other EU partners, we will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  Ireland joined a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee in October 2019, and a Joint Letter at the UN Human Rights Council in July 2019, which outlined our concerns in the Xinjiang.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-14a.1249.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400085#WRW02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 463 to 465, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  Recruitment to the EU&rsquo;s Institutions is carried out centrally by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO). EPSO regularly runs open competitions to recruit generalist and specialist EU civil servants. The most common form of entry to the EU Institutions is through the AD5 Generalist competition, which is the entry-level point for graduates. This competition is commonly referred to as the EU &ldquo;concours&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, five Irish citizens have passed the AD5 Generalist competition. Two Irish citizens were recruited in 2015, one in 2017 and two in 2018. EPSO did not hold an AD5 Generalist competition in 2016. The 2019 competition is ongoing and has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  In 2015, 172 Irish citizens applied to sit the AD5 Generalist tests. In 2017, 167 submitted a valid application and in 2018, 176 Irish people submitted an application. The ongoing 2019 competition saw 191 Irish people submit an application.</p>  <p>  In addition, since 2015 Irish citizens have also been recruited by the Institutions through other avenues, including through competitions run for specialists (e.g. recruitment competitions for auditors or lawyer-linguists) and through competitions that employ individuals on the basis of a temporary or fixed-term contract.</p>  <p>  The Blue Book Traineeship programme is run by the European Commission on a six-monthly basis. Participation by Irish citizens in that programme since 2015 is as follows:</p>  <p>  - 2015: 24</p>  <p>  - 2016: 19</p>  <p>  - 2017: 23</p>  <p>  - 2018: 22</p>  <p>  - 2019: 27</p>  <p>  - 2020: 35</p>  <p>  Irish citizens also take part in the Junior Professionals in Delegation Programme, which is run by the European External Action Service and the European Commission and places highly-qualified junior professionals from Member States in EU Delegations around the world. Similarly, the National Expert in Professional Training programme is open to Irish civil service, giving Irish officials the opportunity to have a short-term placement in the EU&rsquo;s Institutions.</p>  <p>  It has become clear in recent years that there will soon be a significant reduction in the number of Irish officials in senior roles in the EU Institutions, as many high-ranking Irish officials will soon retire. At the current rates of recruitment of permanent staff, we are far below the replacement rate. This poses a serious challenge.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs manages the EU Jobs campaign to promote careers in the EU in Ireland. The campaign publicises EU career opportunities, including traineeships, in Ireland&rsquo;s third-level institutions. The campaign also provides support to Irish citizens who have applied for permanent jobs in the EU Institutions, providing information and advice for the duration of the recruitment competition.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels dedicates significant resources to building and maintaining relations with Irish citizens working in the EU. It also provides Irish EU staff with assistance to help them advance to the highest levels of senior management in the Institutions.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade manages the Centrally Funded Scheme for Seconded National Experts was established in 2014 to support the secondment of Irish Government officials to the EU. The scheme, which provides for secondments to international as well as EU institutions, has a budget of &euro;1.8 million for 2020. To date in 2020, it has financed the secondment of twenty-four Irish officials to the EU Institutions.</p>  <p>  Both programmes aim to increase Ireland&rsquo;s representation in the staffing of the EU&rsquo;s Institutions, though it is clear that more needs to be done in this area. The Programme for Government commits to the development of a new strategy to increase the presence of Irish people in the senior ranks of the EU Institutions. We will also aim to increase the number of young Irish people applying for traineeships in the EU&rsquo;s Institutions.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform continue to work together in analysing these issues, and in developing Ireland&rsquo;s overall policy approach to EU staffing.  These will help to inform the new strategy.  In addition, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will reflect Ireland&rsquo;s EU careers objectives in the forthcoming Civil Service HR Strategy, and in workforce plans of Civil Service Departments and offices from 2020 onwards.</p></reply>

The Centrally Funded Scheme covers the cost of secondments to the EU&rsquo;s Institutions and other international organisations, where these costs are not provided for by the host institution. On average, 24 secondments have been funded annually through the scheme. A total of 23 secondments have been funded to date in 2020. The scheme is vitally important in building up EU expertise within the civil service. All Government Departments and Agencies have access to funding through the scheme.</p>  <p>  As well as the funding provided by the Centrally Funded Scheme, Government Departments and/or the EU Institutions also cover the costs of some secondments. In 2020, nine Irish officials were seconded to the EU&rsquo;s Institutions in this manner.</p>  <p>  In addition to the secondees mentioned above,  there are eight staff in my Department who are serving in assignments in the EU Institutions are assigned to the European External Action Service (EEAS), including one at Head of EU Delegation level. </p>  <p>  The EEAS is the European Union&rsquo;s diplomatic service created to promote an EU-wide common foreign and security policy. It is staffed by officers from the EU Commission, the EU Council Secretariat and the Foreign Ministries of EU Member States, including my Department. The recruitment of diplomats from Member States to serve in the EEAS enhances the links and interaction with the diplomatic services of the Member States. My Department takes all reasonable steps to support the candidacies of Irish applicants for EEAS posts. Officers who are offered positions have been, and will continue to be, granted special leave for the duration of their assignments.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to ensuring that Ireland is adequately represented in EU Institutions, including the EEAS. This will be an area of focus for my Department in recognition of the value of placing Irish civil servants in key positions to enhance our influence and contribute to the effective functioning of EU institutions.</p></reply>

Ireland is now working on preparations for taking up our Security Council seat in January, including by reviewing all items on the Council&rsquo;s agenda, which includes the situation in Western Sahara.</p>  <p>  Our position on the situation in Western Sahara remains one of support to the UN-led process and the Secretary-General&rsquo;s efforts to reach a definitive political settlement on this issue. We support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, but we do not have a view on the outcome of that decision &ndash; be it independence, integration, autonomy, or some other solution &ndash; so long as it is decided in a genuine exercise of self-determination. </p>  <p>  This will remain our position when we take up our seat on the Security Council, and we will be ready to support all efforts to advance the UN-led process and reach a lasting settlement. We would like to see the appointment, as soon as possible, of a new UN Special Envoy, to take forward that process and build on the momentum which had been developing under the previous Special Envoy, Horst K&ouml;hler, before his departure last year.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support the important work of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), where two members of Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed. On 30 October 2019, the Security Council adopted Resolution 2494, which extended the mandate of the Mission by 12 months.  In extending the mandate of the Mission, the Security Council reaffirmed its commitment to assist the parties to achieve a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution, based on compromise.</p></reply>

The network also ensures efficient delivery of passport and consular services to our citizens, support to emigrant organisations and outreach to the diaspora and other networks of influence.</p><p>The work of my Department in promoting a more just, fair, secure and sustainable world continues through Mission engagement with multilateral institutions and agencies, including those of the United Nations, and via implementation of the development aid programme in partner countries.

Ireland has not undertaken a formal legal analysis in respect of the draft instrument with other EU Member States and the exchange of views that we have had with other MS is intended to inform policy deliberations on the EU's approach to the issue. </p>  <p>  As with all exchanges of views with other EU Member States on policy issues, the views that other Member States have shared with us in this context have been shared confidentially. I do not therefore intend to comment publicly on policy formulation on this issue that is underway in other Member States. </p>  <p>  As noted in replies to previous parliamentary questions, Ireland is open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty.  With regard to its scope, we believe that all economic operators, whether transnational or purely domestic, should be treated in a non-discriminatory manner. We would also wish to see essential human rights principles reflected in any possible instrument, which should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations.  We would also like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p>  <p>  I would also note that the European Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, recently announced plans by the European Commission to develop a legislative proposal by 2021, aimed at requiring businesses to carry out due diligence in relation to the potential human rights and environmental impacts of their operations and supply chains.</p></reply>

Ireland has also called on numerous occasions for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court. </p>  <p>  Despite the fear which the regime spreads, there are recent reports of people peacefully protesting in Government-controlled areas in southern Syria - and also reports that many of them have been detained. We support their right to freedom of assembly.  </p>  <p>  The Syrian Government has not varied its repression over the last decade, despite sustained international pressure. Ireland and the EU have repeatedly condemned violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law perpetrated by the Syrian regime and other actors such as ISIS, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity.  </p>  <p>  In the absence of a consensus at the UN on implementing sanctions, the EU has imposed its own sanctions regime on Syria, which includes bans on exports of arms, of goods which could be used for internal repression, and goods which could be used to make chemical weapons. A number of individuals against whom there is evidence of significant human rights abuses in Syria are also subject to individual EU sanctions.</p>  <p>  Ireland has worked both at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council to highlight infringements of human rights in Syria. On 22 June 2020, for example, Ireland co-sponsored a Resolution at the Human Rights Council which condemned the use of arbitrary arrest, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances by the Syrian authorities, demanded the immediate release of all persons arbitrarily detained, and noted the importance of ensuring justice for all those detained. Ireland also noted several concerns relating to violations of international law and human rights abuses in Syria in a national statement delivered at the Human Rights Council on 10 March. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to call on all parties in Syria to ensure protection of human rights. The EU has made very clear, over a period of many years, our strong condemnation of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Assad regime. We will continue to prioritise this issue in the context of our forthcoming tenure on the Security Council for 2021/2022.</p></reply>

The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 321 personnel and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 134 personnel. </p>  <p>  In relation to UNDOF, Defence Forces personnel are currently based in Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation.  On 12 June 2020, the Government approved the continued participation of the Defence Forces in UNDOF for a 12 month period up to June 2021.</p>  <p>  The UNIFIL mission in Lebanon continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment and on 15 May 2020 the Government approved the continued participation of the Defence Forces in UNIFIL for a further 12 month period.  Irish troops are currently serving as part of a joint Irish-Polish Battalion in UNIFIL.  </p>  <p>  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with 13 personnel; MINUSMA, the UN authorised operation in Mali with 13 personnel, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in Israel and Syria with 10 personnel, the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) with two (2) personnel, the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with five (5) personnel, the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 13 personnel and the EU Naval mission (Operation Irini) with three (3) personnel.  Ireland also contributes observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions and personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU, NATO/PfP and OSCE headquarters.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests from time to time in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  Ireland has always been a strong supporter of the United Nations and UN Peacekeeping.  Our commitment and support for the primary role of the United Nations, in the maintenance of international peace and security, is expressed in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping operations.  This commitment is also expressed in our engagement in the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).</p></reply>

The person in question also instituted civil proceedings in respect of the same injury and was awarded compensation by the High Court.  The disability pension payable was therefore reviewed under the provisions of section 13(2) of the 1923 Act and it was decided to reduce it by the annuity value of the total compensation which he had received.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the person in question applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the decision to reduce the disability pension. The High Court quashed the decision to reduce the disability pension and ordered that the matter be considered anew. A fresh review of the disability pension was accordingly undertaken.  All aspects of the case (including, in particular, representations made by his solicitors) were fully considered and in March 1988 the then Minister decided to reduce the disability pension payable by the annuity value of the total compensation received by the person in question. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the disability pension in this case was properly determined in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions by the then Minister and I do not believe that a further review of the decision under Section 13(2) would be appropriate.</p>  <p>  Finally, any increases which were due under the terms of  the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) 2018-2020 (and previous pay agreements) have been applied to date to the pension payable to the person in question.</p></reply>

This allocation provides for the pay and allowances of over 10,400 public service employees, the upgrade and replacement of essential military equipment and infrastructure, ongoing Defence Forces operational and standing costs as well as funding in respect of Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society. </p>  <p>  Gross expenditure to the end of June 2020 was &euro;337 million, representing 43% of the Defence Vote allocation. This level of expenditure is some &euro;28.6 million (7.8%) below profile and is broadly in line with expenditure trends in recent years. </p>  <p>  Recruitment plans to date this year have been impacted by COVID 19 and expenditure trends on pay subheads reflect this. In that context, the military authorities have advised that they are currently finalising plans to re-commence collective training and recruitment, taking public health guidelines into account. On non-pay subheads, progress on some planned projects has been delayed in the first half of the year, however, a significant number of projects are expected to advance before year-end.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor expenditure on the Vote over the coming months and at this stage it is expected that overall expenditure outturn will be substantially in line with provision at year-end.</p></reply>

The Special Education Teacher allocation allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs. It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions. </p>  <p>  My Department has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at www.education.ie</p>  <p>  The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, procedures are in place if schools can demonstrate that they have high concentrations of pupils requiring English as an Additional Language (EAL) support. Schools can lodge an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board for a review of staffing allocation for EAL support in accordance with the procedures set out in the primary (0018/20) school staffing schedule circulars. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service works through a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to support schools to identify and meet the needs of individual pupils.  NEPS psychologists can provide advice and guidance to Principals and teachers in relation to individual students&rsquo; needs and in the development of whole school approaches to support inclusion, participation and integration.  In addition, NEPS psychologists support schools to implement early-intervention and prevention programmes, such as The Incredible Years Programme in Primary Schools and resilience building programmes, such as the FRIENDS Programmes at Primary and Post Primary levels. Should the schools, to whom the Deputy refers in his question, have concerns in relation to the social, emotional or educational development of any of their pupils it remains open to them to raise these issues with their assigned NEPS psychologist with a view to the psychologist becoming directly involved with the pupil, where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Needs is to provide a reasonable level of transport service for children with a diagnosed disability and/or special educational need. My Department allocates funding to schools to enable them to employ escorts on school transport services, these escorts are specifically engaged by the schools to cater for children with special educational needs whose care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support.  While the children who were sanctioned the assistance of a school bus escort continue to remain on their existing services, my Department will continue to provide funding for the escorts appointed to continue to remain on these services with the child who has special educational needs.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37.  A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  The legislation was activated for a second time on 29 October 2019 following a report by the NCSE which identified children in South Dublin needing special education school places. Since then, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity amongst schools in the South Dublin area. </p>  <p>  On 21 April 2020 my Department received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p>  <p>  The report identifies the schools who it is considered have potential to provide additional places. These schools were identified following an extensive engagement with schools and their patron bodies and parents in the area.</p>  <p>  Having considered the report, the Minister accepted the opinion of the NCSE and statutory notices have been served on 39 schools in the area on 26 June last.</p>  <p>  I understand that already some progress has been made and the NCSE is working with a number of schools to establish classes for this coming school year.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the NCSE, will continue to work through the next steps in this process.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students. </p>  <p>  For the calculated grades system to be operated with integrity, an estimated percentage mark, based on credible, satisfactory evidence, can only be accepted from an appropriate source. This is necessary to ensure fairness to all students.  </p>  <p>  Detailed guidance for schools on calculated grades was published on 21 May. The document sets out information on the process that was to be undertaken for estimating marks for students to receive calculated grades, and was sent to all schools. The document, together with Frequently Asked Questions, are available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate. Additional guidance to schools on the avoidance of unconscious bias, interpreting evidence of achievement in the case of students with disabilities, and further guidance on bonus marks that would have applied for answering the written examinations through Irish issued to schools on 28 May.</p>  <p>  Schools have since returned estimated percentage marks for students to the Departments Calculated Grades Executive Office. </p>  <p>  Research makes clear that because teacher judgments are made in the context of each school, they need to be examined and adjusted at a national level to ensure comparability across different schools and that a common national standard is applied. </p>  <p>  In the national standardisation phase school-sourced data will be combined with historical data. This standardisation process will be used to ensure that the calculated grades reflect standards that are properly aligned across schools and with a common national standard.  The key principles of objectivity, equity and fairness will be further underpinned within the national standardisation process and the process has been designed to arrive at fair representations of student performance which does not favour any type of student or school. These data sets allow the production of good calculations of the distributions of marks to be expected for each school and nationally.</p>  <p>  The relevant Department data sets that support the process include mark data at: </p>  <p>  - National level for both Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate examinations for 2019 and previous years; </p>  <p>  - School level for both Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate examinations for 2019 and previous years; </p>  <p>  - Candidate level for both Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate examinations for 2019 and previous years; </p>  <p>  - Candidate level for the Junior Certificate results of the 2020 Leaving Certificate cohort of candidates. </p>  <p>  In advance of receiving the estimated percentage marks from schools the information about how the school has done in the past and the information about the strengths and weakness of the current group of students will all be assembled and will be used to predict the level of achievement that this particular group of students would have been expected to reach in that subject if those students had sat the Leaving Certificate examination in the normal way. This information is then combined with the estimates that the school has provided in order to generate the fairest possible result that can be calculated. Checks have to be made to ensure that the outcomes of the standardisation process are valid &ndash; this involves checking that the standardisation process has not been unfair to students. </p>  <p>  An independent Steering Committee chaired by Dr &Aacute;ine Lawlor, former Director of the Teaching Council, is overseeing the quality and integrity of the outcomes of the calculated grades system. It is intended to publish further details about the standardisation process following the issue of calculated grades to candidates. </p>  <p>  After the national standardisation process, the calculated marks will be converted into calculated grades, and these grades will be issued to candidates. The calculated grades will be expressed in the same manner as currently applies to Leaving Certificate grades - H1, H2, O1, O2, etc.</p></reply>

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. </p>  <p>  The aim of these distance learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  The reopening in time for the start of the new school year remains a top priority for my department.</p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, the Department recently published a report to Government on Planning for reopening schools in line with the Roadmap for reopening. This report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with relevant agencies, including the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), identified the following key priorities in supporting students in re-engaging with the curriculum in the new school year:</p>  <p>  1. The wellbeing and socialisation of students</p>  <p>  2. Assessing where students are in terms of their learning</p>  <p>  3. Identifying the additional supports that particular learners may require</p>  <p>  4. Exploring options for remote provision that will compliment in-school provision and address curriculum gaps experienced during school closure</p>  <p>  It is recognised that schools continue to be best placed to make decisions about how to support and educate all their learners during this period. My Department will continue to collaborate with the NCCA to develop guidance to schools to assist them in their planning for the next school year so as to ensure that curricular priorities are delivered and that teaching and learning is optimal in these circumstances, guided at all times by public health advice.</p>  <p>  Students going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of their preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021. The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has statutory responsibility for the operation of the state examinations. My Department will engage with the SEC and the NCCA in the development of fair and robust assessment arrangements in relation to both the Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making.</p></reply>

For domestic students factors such as the expected student experience, and the availability of other opportunities for employment or training will have an impact. </p>  <p>  In addition, while a student may request to defer their place in a third-level institution, there is no guarantee this request will be granted. If the deferral is not granted the student will have to choose between taking up the offered place in the current academic year, or re-applying through the CAO the following year. The choice of whether to grant a deferral rests with the admissions office of the institution in question.</p>  <p>  Ultimately international student enrolments, and student deferrals will depend on the choices of the individuals in question and are not within the power of my Department to predict but my Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders in this regard.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students. </p>  <p>  For the calculated grades system to be operated with integrity, an estimated percentage mark, based on credible, satisfactory evidence, can only be accepted from an appropriate source. This is necessary to ensure fairness to all students.  </p>  <p>  The Calculated Grades Executive Office in the Department of Education has developed a comprehensive guide to calculated grades for out of school learners &ndash; the students who are studying entirely outside of school &ndash; and has contacted each student individually on 25 June to invite them to apply for calculated grades.  The closing date for applications was Thursday 2 July 2020 and applications are now being processed. </p>  <p>  In cases where a student who is attending school, but who is studying one or more subjects outside of school, school principals were asked to make every effort to provide an estimated mark for that subject(s) provided there was sufficient, credible evidence available from an appropriate source.  If the principal was unable to provide an estimated mark for any student they were asked to notify the Calculated Grades Executive Office of my Department. </p>  <p>  As part of its commitment to ensure that a calculated grade is provided to as many students as possible, the CGEO are currently undertaking a review of these reports with the schools involved to ensure that the correct procedures were followed. </p>  <p>  Despite every effort being made by schools and by the Department of Education, to provide calculated grades to as many students as possible, there will be a small number of cases where there is no credible evidence to support a calculated grade in a particular subject. To attempt to give a calculated grade in such cases would be unfair to all other candidates. </p>  <p>  Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so. </p>  <p>  No decisions have been issued by the Calculated Grades Office in respect of any of these students - either those studying independently, or those attending school but studying a subject (or subjects) outside school,  to date.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education has continued to engage with third level stakeholders regarding the Calculated Grades process for students seeking to progress to Higher Education. This has resulted in an agreed common approach in relation to students who have not been able to obtain calculated grades in one or more subjects. Students who have applied for a calculated grade, with a view to satisfying matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements and for whom the Department has been unable to award a Calculated Grade in the subject(s), will be granted an exemption in the subject(s) solely for matriculation/basic minimum entry purposes. The CGEO will notify the CAO of any student who cannot be provided with calculated grades, and of the subjects involved, and the exemption from  matriculation/basic minimum entry will be granted automatically by the CAO.  The subject(s) for which exemption is granted will not attract points and the exemption cannot be used to satisfy additional programme requirements over and above the matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements.</p></reply>

Profiles of achievement at Leaving Certificate level over the last three years will be used as part of this process and this will help ensure that the grades issued remain in line with national performance standards over time. Nonetheless, there will be fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year, which will depend on the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirements and the grades received by applicants.</p>  <p>  In light of the current public health circumstances, it is difficult to predict the expected international student numbers for next academic year. Much depends on unfolding events such as all available national and international public health advice, particularly in respect of international travel for programmes where a physical presence in Ireland is needed. </p>  <p>  Higher education institutions are autonomous with regard to management of their academic affairs including admissions procedures. The CAO processes applications for undergraduate, and some postgraduate, courses on behalf of the HEIs.  Decisions on admissions, including the number of places offered, are made by the HEIs which then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. Neither I nor my Department have any role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  However a quota applies to the intake of EU students to medical education. Thereafter, the number of places allocated to non-EU students is a matter for the individual HEI concerned with the availability of clinical placements being an important factor in this regard.</p></reply>

The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, as in the case of Presentation Secondary School, Milltown, a selection process may be necessary.

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  A Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or on the basis of some other criterion, including giving priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school, commonly known as a feeder school.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. </p>  <p>  The question of enrolment in individual schools, including the setting of catchment areas, is the responsibility of the managerial authorities on behalf of the school Patron and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.</p></reply>

It is expected that the Framework will be published in the coming weeks, thus providing an invaluable resource to the third-level institutions. </p></reply>

This research has included surveys of school principals and parents as well as engagement with students. The research indicates that the experience of distance learning varied widely for students and was strongly dependent on factors such as access to devices and adequate broadband coverage.  Students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and students with special educational needs  appear to  have been most affected by the shift to distance learning.  This replicates the experience in other countries worldwide where the closure of schools due to Covid-19 has greatly interrupted students&rsquo; learning in general and particularly that of the most vulnerable students. A detailed analysis of the national and international research that has been published and other available data is underway within my Department and will inform guidance from the Department on the full re-opening of schools. </p>  <p>  The key focus now is getting all schools to re-open from the beginning of September and to help students settle back into school and make progress in their learning with as much ease as possible. I am conscious of the need to avoid placing any additional burden on schools at this time, including additional work or disruption to learning that could arise from conducting further research surveys or testing in schools. </p>  <p>  I am conscious, of course, of the need to monitor the successes that are achieved and challenges that will arise as schools resume working, so that policy, guidance and practical supports are adjusted as necessary. Circulars have issued to schools in late June, detailing how my Department's Inspectorate will be engaging with schools once they re-open: inspectors will be focussed on providing advisory and support sessions or visits for schools to assit in the resumption of schooling, and information arising from these engagements will be systematically analysed to provide feedback to my Department. This information and analyses will inform the provision of any further guidance and supports.</p></reply>

The decision was taken at the time when there was uncertainty as to whether the schools would reopen again in the 2019/2020 school year. </p>  <p>  The priority of my Department at the time was to support the learning and wellbeing of all our learners and this has not changed.  On return to school the focus for teachers and the whole school community will be on settling the children and returning to normality in the classroom without the added pressure of having to undertake standardised tests. It is not envisaged by my Department that standardised tests of reading and Mathematics will be administered on the return to school. </p>  <p>  I would note that Standardised Tests are but only one of a number of assessment tools that can be used to inform teaching and learning in primary schools.  Consideration by teachers of the different assessment forms they might take to assess their pupils&rsquo; learning without placing any stress or pressure on the pupil to include teacher observation, questioning, tasks and pupil-teacher conferencing should be considered.  </p>  <p>  My Department will issue Return to School curriculum guidance in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Analysis of the parental preferences expressed in each area surveyed indicated that there was sufficient parental demand to support changes in school patronage, including in the area to which the Deputy refers.  </p>  <p>  For such areas, the patronage divesting process was intended to be based on using school buildings which had closed or where a school building may be freed up as a result of an amalgamation of two or more schools.  In some areas, including in the case of the area referred to by the Deputy, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, my Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.</p>  <p>  To date, it has not been possible to secure a school property to facilitate a new school being established in the area. However, the Department is continuing its efforts in relation to identifying a suitable solution under the patronage divesting process.</p>  <p>  In addition, the requirement for new schools to meet emerging demographic demand is kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard to the impact of the increased roll out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. These details are held at individual school level. The Deputy will note however that the selection process procedures and enrolment policy are the responsibility of the individual school authorities.</p>  <p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parent&rsquo;s choice are respected.</p>  <p>  Under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 where a board of management make a decision to refuse enrolment, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where the appeal involves an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, the appeal must be made to the local ETB in the first instance. Further information on the Section 29 Appeals process is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/Appeal-against-Permanent-Exclusion-Suspension-or-Refusal-to-Enrol/</p>  <p>  In addition, the Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718815.</p>  <p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that Kilkenny Carlow Education Training Board has confirmed that places for first year applicants are available in Col&aacute;iste Pobail Osrai and Kilkenny City Vocational School (KCVS).  It is open to the parents /guardians of the children concerned to make direct contact with the schools should they wish to submit an enrolment application to these schools. The schools may be contacted through the following email addresses:  Cathy.Mcsorley@KCVS.ie  and for Colaiste Pobail Osrai, priomhoide@osrai.ie.</p></reply>

The third National Access Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2015-2021) (NAP) sets out the Departments current strategy to address underrepresentation in higher education by groups identified in the plan.  The NAP identifies Irish Travellers as one of the target groups that are currently being under-represented in higher education. A progress review of NAP published in 2018 which extended the lifetime of the current plan to 2021, showed that while increases are evident in participation in Irish Travellers, there remains a significant challenge in achieving the target in respect of the Traveller target group. Even though the realisation of targets is proving difficult, evidence has shown that the number of Irish Travellers accessing higher education has increased from 35 (2012/2013) to 61 (2017/2018); a 74% increase since the commencement of this NAP. </p>  <p>  Various initiatives under the strands of The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) funding aimed at increasing Traveller participation will assist in the realisation of the target and enhance understanding of the barriers that exist in respect of access to higher education by Traveller students.  All PATH initiatives will support increased participation by Travellers however there are some dedicated entirely to this target group. This includes Marino Institute of Education TOBAR project) (PATH1): Travellers Accessing Initial Teacher Education. This project focuses on targeting increased Traveller participation in Initial Teacher Education at primary level through engagement with Traveller community groups and targeted post primary schools, the provision of direct entry places and continuous support for Travellers who have been identified as aspiring to become a primary school teacher. There are two strands, B.Ed. Route and a direct entry (PME) and Continuous support.  7 Traveller students registered on the Tobar programme as on 30 September 2019. Traveller Awareness Training has been rolled out in some PME courses. Eight School workshops and specific meetings with 2&mdash;25 students and families.</p>  <p>  Under PATH 2, 10 Irish Travellers have received 1916 Bursaries in the 2017/2018 academic year and a further 13 Travellers received a 1916 Bursary in 2018/19. 2019/2020 figures are not confirmed at this stage however indications are that this figure has further increased.</p>  <p>  PATH 3 supports the development of regional clusters of HEIs to build capacity to support a regional approach to Access policy and initiatives. A number of specific Traveller projects are being supported &ndash; including the Travellers in Education  project led by the South Cluster of HEIs which is promoting a whole-school approach to addressing Traveller participation needs.</p>  <p>  The PATH fund was confirmed as a permanent fund in 2020 and has a current investment envelope of &euro;30.9 million over the period 2016 to 2022, across the three strands.</p>  <p>  While it is hoped that the numerous initiatives under the strands of The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) funding aimed at increasing Traveller participation will assist in the realisation of the target and enhance understanding of the barriers that exist in respect of access to higher education by Traveller students, it was considered that a specific action plan would bring a particular focus of attention on the on-going issue of underrepresentation of Travellers in HE. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Traveller Participation in Higher Education 2019-2021 was published in November 2019. The overall objective of the Plan is to advance Traveller participation in higher education within the context of approaches on retention and transition of Travellers across the education spectrum. The Department is working closely with the HEA, Traveller Groups and other implementation partners to ensure roll-out of the Actions.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently engaged in ongoing consultation with Traveller representative groups since the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department took part in a Forum on Traveller Transfers into Tertiary Education organised by Pavee Point and the National Travellers Women Forum on 27th May, 2020 and a subsequent round table discussion with access offices in Higher Education Institutions which considered the Forum Report on Monday, 29 June 2020. </p></reply>

This amending legislation, when commenced, will facilitate the inclusion of the qualifications of other awarding bodies including international, professional and UK awarding bodies. When commenced, such awarding body may choose to apply to QQI to have their qualifications, such as those in question, included in the Framework. </p><p>Currently, NARIC Ireland, hosted by QQI, provides recognition advice on foreign academic qualifications. This service provides comparability statements for a substantial number of qualifications from a wide range of countries aimed at assisting understanding of these qualifications in the context of the Irish education and training system. In addition to assisting the qualification holder, these statements can also help employers, funding agencies and education and training institutions to determine if an applicant holds the academic qualifications for a particular job, funding or course. These statements are available to download free of charge from its website at .</p><p>The cooperation agreement between QQI and the Education Bureau of Hong Kong has facilitated an international level-to-level comparison exercise between the Hong Kong Qualifications Framework (HKQF) and the NFQ which has utilised European Qualification Framework as a reference guide. This work is aimed at enhancing the transparency of qualifications systems in Hong Kong and Ireland by showing how both frameworks relate to each other at system levels. While this supports the portability of qualifications between the jurisdictions and would facilitate the recognition process, it does not align nor recognise individual qualifications in their own right.  </p><p>While the UK is departing the EU, it has recently competed a referencing of its Qualifications Frameworks to the European Qualifications Framework. QQI collaborates closely with its UK counterparts on both bi-lateral and international initiatives that promote the transparency, recognition and mobility of qualifications between both jurisdictions and this work will continue post-Brexit. The qualifications authorities in the UK and Ireland have agreed the correspondence between qualifications frameworks in operation across the jurisdictions. This has resulted in a joint publication, Qualifications can cross Boundaries, which indicates the level of a UK qualification within the Irish NFQ.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The Deputy will note however that the selection process procedures and enrolment policy are the responsibility of the individual school authorities.</p>  <p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to  disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parent&rsquo;s choice are respected.</p>  <p>  Under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 where a board of management make a decision to refuse enrolment, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where the appeal involves an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, the appeal must be made to the local ETB in the first instance. Further information on the Section 29 Appeals process is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/Appeal-against-Permanent-Exclusion-Suspension-or-Refusal-to-Enrol/</p>  <p>  In addition, the Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718815.</p>  <p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that Kilkenny Carlow Education Training Board has confirmed that places for first year applicants are available in Col&aacute;iste Pobail Osrai and Kilkenny City Vocational School (KCVS).  It is open to the parents /guardians of the children concerned to make direct contact with the schools should they wish to submit an enrolment application to these schools. The schools may be contacted through the following email addresses: Cathy.Mcsorley@KCVS.ie  and for Colaiste Pobail Osrai, priomhoide@osrai.ie.</p>  <p>  I wish to confirm to the Deputy that in the school planning area for post primary schools in County Kilkenny, the total number of pupil enrolments for the 2019/2020 academic year was 8,320 of which 4,640 pupils were enrolled in post primary schools in Kilkenny City. </p></reply>

Where alternative assessment methods are not possible, and in line with health guidelines, ETBs are working with all stakeholders to enable learners to progress, including for the small numbers of learners with outstanding practical assessments who have made CAO applications.  ETB institutions have communicated with these learners on the individual approaches being undertaken to enable them progress.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37.  A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  The legislation was activated for a second time on 29 October 2019 following a report by the NCSE which identified children in South Dublin needing special education school places. Since then, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity amongst schools in the South Dublin area. </p>  <p>  On 21 April 2020 my Department received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p>  <p>  The report identifies the schools who it is considered have potential to provide additional places. These schools were identified following an extensive engagement with schools and their patron bodies and parents in the area.</p>  <p>  Having considered the report, the Minister accepted the opinion of the NCSE and statutory notices have been served on 39 schools in the area on 26 June last. </p>  <p>  I understand that already some progress has been made and the NCSE is working with a number of schools to establish classes for this coming school year. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the NCSE will continue to work through the next steps in this process but in the interim the NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO), is available to offer further advice and assistance to parents.</p></reply>

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This was an initial step and took immediate effect.</p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991. </p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019. </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.</p><p>A survey of Secretaries and Caretakers undertaken in 2019 identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April 2019 to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p><p>In May last year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim. </p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasted until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July 2019 to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September 2019. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action. </p><p>On 30 September 2019 F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department and Management Bodies are in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. These talks are subject to the normal procedures including confidentiality. The talks began in the WRC in October.</p><p>Following industrial action, which commenced on the 10<sup>th</sup>January 2020, both parties have agreed to return to talks at the WRC.  F&Oacute;RSA agreed to the WRC request to suspend their ongoing work-to-rule to allow the talks to progress. This suspension was effective from 21<sup>st</sup>January 2020.</p></reply>

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. </p>  <p>  The aim of these distance learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  The reopening in time for the start of the new school year remains a top priority for my department.</p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, the Department recently published a report to Government on Planning for reopening schools in line with the Roadmap for reopening. This report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with relevant agencies, including the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), identified the following key priorities in supporting students in re-engaging with the curriculum in the new school year:</p>  <p>  1. The wellbeing and socialisation of students</p>  <p>  2. Assessing where students are in terms of their learning</p>  <p>  3. Identifying the additional supports that particular learners may require</p>  <p>  4. Exploring options for remote provision that will compliment in-school provision and address curriculum gaps experienced during school closure.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that schools continue to be best placed to make decisions about how to support and educate all their learners during this period. My Department will continue to collaborate with the NCCA to develop guidance to schools to assist them in their planning for the next school year so as to ensure that curricular priorities are delivered and that teaching and learning is optimal in these circumstances, guided at all times by public health advice.</p>  <p>  Students going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of their preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021. The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has statutory responsibility for the operation of the state examinations. My Department will engage with the SEC and the NCCA in the development of fair and robust assessment arrangements in relation to both the Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making.</p></reply>

To attempt to give a calculated grade in such cases would be unfair to all other candidates. </p>  <p>  Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so. </p>  <p>  No decisions have been issued by the Calculated Grades Office in respect of any of these students &ndash; either those studying independently, or those attending school but studying a subject (or subjects) outside school, to date.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education has continued to engage with third level stakeholders regarding the Calculated Grades process for students seeking to progress to Higher Education.   This has resulted in an agreed common approach in relation to students who have not been able to obtain calculated grades in one or more subjects.  Students who have applied for a calculated grade, with a view to satisfying matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements and for whom the Department has been unable to award a Calculated Grade in the subject(s), will be granted an exemption in the subject(s) solely for matriculation/basic minimum entry purposes.  The CGEO will notify the CAO of any student who cannot be provided with calculated grades, and of the subjects involved, and the exemption from  matriculation/basic minimum entry will be granted automatically by the CAO.  The subject(s) for which exemption is granted will not attract points and the exemption cannot be used to satisfy additional programme requirements over and above the matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements.</p></reply>

The existence of the Teaching Council, as a statutory body with a statutory role in the registration of registered teachers, enabled my Department to bring forward the relevant legislative provisions under the Teaching Council Amendment Act 2015 which allowed for such a streamlined mechanism to be put in place in the case of registered teachers.  </p>  <p>  However, it is not possible for my Department to put in place similar legislative arrangements in respect of non-teaching staff, such as Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).</p>  <p>  The Vetting Act provides that a relevant organisation must, other than in certain limited circumstances, obtain a vetting disclosure from the National Vetting Bureau prior to commencing the employment of an employee to undertake relevant work with children or vulnerable adults.  Each school is a relevant organisation under the Vetting Act and the creation of a panel of potential SNA employees, including a panel of substitutes,  across schools would not obviate the obligation of each individual school to obtain a vetting disclosure prior to employing a person from such a panel.</p>  <p>  The Vetting Act however allows for some limited exemptions to this requirement, including certain exemptions that are applicable in the case of recurring substitute employments such as a recurring substitute SNA employment.  The Act&rsquo;s exemptions in respect of substitute employments are set out in section 5.3 of my Department&rsquo;s Circular. </p>  <p>  Under the new statutory vetting procedures, the vetting of SNAs and other non-teaching staff continues to be conducted via the relevant diocesan office or school management body as the relevant conduit organisation for the vetting of SNAs and other non-teaching staff employed by schools. In the case of ETB schools the relevant ETB is the relevant organisation for such vetting.</p></reply>

This remains unchanged. </p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme was published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs. While SNAs are very much valued in the provision of care support, the Review recommended that a more broadly based set of supports was required including therapeutic supports.  The current School Inclusion Pilot involving 78 schools is based on this recommendation.   </p>  <p>  The Review also referenced SNA qualifications and training. One of the recommendations of the Review was the development of a national training programme at FETAC level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications for existing and new SNAs.  A quality training programme is being developed and will be available to all SNAs from January next.  The aim of the programme is to ensure that all SNAs have the skills and competencies to carry out their care support role in schools.  </p>  <p>  While many SNAs have qualifications above the entry requirement, there are no plans to change the the qualifications required for appointment.  </p></reply>

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students. </p>  <p>  For the calculated grades system to be operated with integrity, an estimated percentage mark, based on credible, satisfactory evidence, can only be accepted from an appropriate source. This is necessary to ensure fairness to all students.  </p>  <p>  The Calculated Grades Executive Office in the Department of Education has developed a comprehensive guide to calculated grades for out of school learners &ndash; the students who are studying entirely outside of school &ndash; and has contacted each student individually on 25 June to invite them to apply for calculated grades.  The closing date for applications was Thursday 2 July 2020 and applications are now being processed. </p>  <p>  In cases where a student who is attending school, but who is studying one or more subjects outside of school, school principals were asked to make every effort to provide an estimated mark for that subject(s) provided there was sufficient, credible evidence available from an appropriate source.  If the principal was unable to provide an estimated mark for any student they were asked to notify the Calculated Grades Executive Office of my Department. </p>  <p>  As part of its commitment to ensure that a calculated grade is provided to as many students as possible, the CGEO are currently undertaking a review of these reports with the schools involved to ensure that the correct procedures were followed. </p>  <p>  Despite every effort being made by schools and by the Department of Education, to provide calculated grades to as many students as possible, there will be a small number of cases where there is no credible evidence to support a calculated grade in a particular subject. To attempt to give a calculated grade in such cases would be unfair to all other candidates. </p>  <p>  Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so. </p>  <p>  No decisions have been issued by the Calculated Grades Office in respect of any of these students &ndash; either those studying independently, or those attending school but studying a subject (or subjects) outside school, to date.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education has continued to engage with third level stakeholders regarding the Calculated Grades process for students seeking to progress to Higher Education.   This has resulted in an agreed common approach in relation to students who have not been able to obtain calculated grades in one or more subjects.  Students who have applied for a calculated grade, with a view to satisfying matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements and for whom the Department has been unable to award a Calculated Grade in the subject(s), will be granted an exemption in the subject(s) solely for matriculation/basic minimum entry purposes.  The CGEO will notify the CAO of any student who cannot be provided with calculated grades, and of the subjects involved, and the exemption from  matriculation/basic minimum entry will be granted automatically by the CAO.  The subject(s) for which exemption is granted will not attract points and the exemption cannot be used to satisfy additional programme requirements over and above the matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements. </p></reply>

The interests of students and their families, as well as the safety of the staff in our schools, are at the centre of all considerations as we work through the various challenges associated with that aim. The re-opening our schools will be guided by the available public health advice and comprehensive engagement with stakeholders including the school management bodies and staff representatives as well as students and parents. I published the interim public health advice received from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to make it available to all schools.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding my Department&rsquo;s overall objective, planning for a blended/remote learning approach may, by necessity, be a feature of the planning to reopen schools to ensure contingency and capacity in schools to provide for continuity of learning if required. My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, the NCCA, SEC and other experts, as required, are working to develop guidance on how to tailor teaching, learning and assessment to appropriately meet the needs of all students as they re-engage with school. </p>  <p>  Schools have been very innovative is supporting their students during the school closures including developing measures to address challenges where the schools and or students are in areas with poor no broadband services. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to address the various challenges and everyone involved is committed to concluding planning for reopening by the end of this month so that schools have sufficient time to prepare at a local level for their re-opening. I am also committed to full and comprehensive communication with schools, teachers, students and parents so that they are fully informed about the plans for reopening schools for the next school year.</p></reply>

The Department is engaging with the education partners and other key stakeholders on working through these contingencies in detail and on the development of guidance and supports for the reopening of schools. This includes measures in relation to social distancing which will be informed by the development of guidance in relation to infection prevention and control in schools.  This guidance will also provide a framework for individual schools to develop plans for the reopening of school in accordance with their own circumstances, the context and needs of their staff and students, and in compliance with public health guidelines. These contingencies and guidance will be worked through in detail in the coming weeks with education partners and stakeholders to ensure that the return to school is safe for children and staff. </p></reply>

It is anticipated hand-sanitisers in key areas in every school in the country, as well as in every classroom will be provided.  To enable the supply of sanitizer fluid for each school, a drawdown framework for use by schools to purchase sanitiser etc. (as well as other potential PPE requirements) is in the process of being established by the Department.</p></reply>

A two level payment structure has also been introduced to link the pandemic unemployment payment level to prior earnings. As we gradually move through the phases of reopening our society and the economy, the pandemic unemployment payment will be assessed to see how it fits into cross-Government plans to keep Ireland healthy while continuing to get the country working again.</p>  <p>  The conditions for receipt of this payment are that a person must have lost their employment due to the pandemic and are now fully unemployed. A self-employed person must have suffered a collapse in their trading income to the extent that they are available to take up other full-time work. Where a self-employed individual has regular employment or it generates significant income, then they should close their pandemic unemployment payment on the basis that they do not satisfy the conditions for the payment. In cases of doubt where emergency or sporadic work is undertaken, an individual should discuss the matter with the Department.  In the case where a person is not satisfied with a decision to withdraw their pandemic unemployment payment on the basis of their level of engagement in employment, they can have this decision reviewed.</p>  <p>  If a person is ineligible for the pandemic unemployment payment as they are engaged in employment, they may be entitled to support under the jobseekers benefit or jobseekers allowance scheme depending on their individual circumstances. A person in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment may take up employment but they must be unemployed for at least 4 days in 7 consecutive days to be eligible for a payment and continue to satisfy the other qualifying conditions of the schemes. </p>  <p>  Jobseekers benefit (self-employed) is available for self-employed people who have ceased trading and is not available while a person is engaged in self-employment. </p>  <p>  The Enterprise Support Grant has recently been extended and will be made available to small business owners who transition from the pandemic unemployment payment to re-open their business. The grant, of up to &euro;1,000, will be payable to self-employed micro enterprises which employ fewer than 10 people, have an annual turnover of less than &euro;1 million and are not eligible for support from the COVID 19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants.

Where a person was due to take up seasonal employment but they were not in employment immediately prior to 13th March they are not eligible to receive the pandemic unemployment payment.  It would be impossible to construct a scheme based on claims of potential or prospective but unrealised employment, particularly where the economy was operating at full-employment with many unfilled vacancies prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  People who do not qualify for the pandemic unemployment payment are eligible to apply for a jobseekers payment.  Jobseeker's benefit is a weekly payment to people who have lost their employment and who satisfy the scheme's statutory conditions including the requirement to have sufficient social insurance contributions paid.  This benefit is paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people who have less than 260 paid.  Where a person does not re-qualify or has used up their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit they can apply for the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position at this time. </p></reply>

Moreover, Ireland&rsquo;s youth unemployment rate has been significantly lower than the EU27 rate for a number of years now; which highlights the progress that had been made in Ireland&rsquo;s labour market recovery in recent years.</p>  <p>  However, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting labour market conditions, the CSO estimated youth unemployment to be at 12.8 percent for June, with the COVID-adjusted rate at just over 45 percent. This COVID-adjusted rate is considered to be the upper bound, as all claimants of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment who are not already included on the Live Register are classified as unemployed.</p>  <p>  My Department recently published a Working Paper entitled &lsquo;The Initial Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Ireland&rsquo;s Labour Market&rsquo;, which highlights that those who have lost their jobs in the sectors most severely impacted as a result of the pandemic and the associated containment measures are more likely to be younger than the overall population. This disproportionate impact is driven by the high levels of young people in employment in the most affected sectors, namely &lsquo;accommodation and food&rsquo; and &lsquo;wholesale and retail trade&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  While planning for economic recovery it is crucial that we provide young people with holistic supports to assist them back to work and support new young entrants to compete for job vacancies in a competitive labour market. We must also not forget our disadvantaged youths who were unemployed prior to the Pandemic and face significant barriers to work.</p>  <p>  Building and enhancing the skills of the workforce will be an important element of economic recovery; having regard to the skills currently in demand and those likely to be in demand by employers in the future. SOLAS are working in partnership with officials in my Department to develop an agile response which brings together and builds on existing further education and training expertise and resources to provide the recently unemployed cohort with the &lsquo;Skills to Compete&rsquo; in the labour market. This activation initiative will support young people to develop their transversal skills and increase employability; build digital competency so as to flourish in the changing world of work; and participate in specific training targeting growth sectors and occupations. </p>  <p>   Intreo, the public employment service which provides job search and activation supports will maintain a close relationship with SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) at a national and local level to identify appropriate opportunities for referral to re-skilling and upskilling opportunities for young jobseekers. </p>  <p>  The Labour Market Advisory Council was convened by my predecessor earlier this year to provide advice to Government on employment and labour market issues. The first task assigned to the Council was to develop, as a matter of urgency, proposals for actions to tackle the labour market challenges arising from the pandemic. This mandate has resulted in the publication of a Policy Paper &lsquo;Preparing for Economic Recovery&rsquo; by the Council, which will assist the Government in developing the public policy responses required to support national economic recovery.  Among its recommendations, the Council recognise:</p>  <p>  - The potential for targeted wage subsidies to ease labour market entrance for young workers in particular.</p>  <p>  - The need to enhance and expand existing work placement programmes such as the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) to broader categories of jobseekers, including increasing the eligible age cohort to include those aged 25-29 years.</p>  <p>  - The additional value to be gained by linking these programmes to upskilling and reskilling opportunities in enhancing the labour market prospects of young jobseekers.</p>  <p>  Targeted policies to assist the labour market prospects and recovery for young jobseekers, will be a strong feature of the July stimulus package and the upcoming Pathways to Work 2020-2025 strategy, with strategy publication expected in Q3 2020.</p></reply>

A person must be fully unemployed for 4 days in 7 consecutive days to qualify for either scheme. They must also satisfy other conditions such as being available for and genuine seeking full time employment and in the case of jobseekers benefit entitlement a person must have sufficient PRSI contributions paid. If a person does not meet the contribution condition for jobseekers benefit they may be eligible for means tested jobseekers allowance. There is also the option of Jobseekers Benefit for the self-employed where the person has ceased trading.</p>  <p>  The Professional Artist Scheme under jobseekers allowance, which was developed in consultation with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is a mechanism to assist self-employed artists who are temporarily in need of additional income support but wish to continue as a professional artist. The scheme acknowledges the status of self-employed artists in specified art forms and gives them a 12 month window to focus on building up their work before they became subject to labour market activation which is mandatory for most recipients of jobseekers payments.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to request the Low Pay Commission to examine Universal Basic Income, so any proposals on that issue will be addressed in that context.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State Pension (Transition).  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  The legislation provides for increases to the State pension age - to 67 in 2021 and further to 68 in 2028.  </p>  <p>  The new Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; states that the planned increase in the State pension age next year will be deferred.  This will require amendment to primary legislation and the Government will bring in the necessary legislation later this year.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a Commission on Pensions will be established to examine sustainability and eligibility issues in relation to State pensions and the Social Insurance Fund.  The Commission is to report to Government by June 2021 on options including the qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements.  The Government will take action, having regard to the recommendations of the Commission, within six months.  Pending the Commission&rsquo;s report and any subsequent Government decisions on its recommendations, it is intended that the State pension age will remain at 66 years as at present.  </p>  <p>  The Programme also proposes an &ldquo;Early Retirement Allowance or Pension&rdquo; for 65 year olds paid at the same rate as Jobseekers Benefit without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.   The new allowance will be introduced as early as possible for those who are retired from employment.  Officials in my Department are currently assessing the necessary legislation, ICT systems and administrative processes required for the introduction of this payment.    </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputies. </p></reply>

This application was disallowed on the basis that his income is in excess of the prescribed limit for his family size and that the excess income is deemed adequate to meet his needs.  A decision letter dated 27/4/2020 issued to the person concerned advising him of his right to appeal the decision of the Deciding Officer to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  </p>  <p>  The person concerned also submitted an application for a State Pension (Contributory) with effect from 16/4/2020.  Unfortunately he did not qualify as he did not satisfy the qualifying conditions.  A qualifying condition for the State Pension (Contributory) is that a person must have at least 520 paid full rate social insurance contributions before their 66th birthday.  A decision letter dated 16/4/2020 issued to the person concerned advising him of his right to appeal this decision to the SWAO.</p>  <p>  It is open to the person concerned to submit an application for a State Pension (Non-Contributory).  This is a means-tested payment where a person doesn't qualify for a contributory pension based on their social insurance (PRSI) contribution record or if they only qualify for a reduced rate of State Pension.  Entitlement to State Pension (Non-Contributory) is subject to a means test.  Items which count as means include cash income, including foreign pensions, the value of any property (excluding a person's own home) and the value of any savings and investments which a person or their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have.  In order to qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory) a person must be habitually resident in the State.</p>  <p>  According to the records of my Department there is no record of a Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment application in respect of the person concerned.  However as the person concerned is 66 years of age, he does not meet the eligibility criteria for receipt of this income support.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. Over 1 million applications in respect of 743,000 individuals have been received. To date, almost 7.8 million payments have issued at a cost of over &euro;2.7 Billion. </p>  <p>  Currently, the Department is focused on processing and managing payments to ensure that they continue to be made to all who qualify for them. The work involved in doing this is complex, with people joining and leaving the scheme each week, along with management of overlaps between the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Department is aware that many people are due some arrears and that each person's case is unique. The Department is currently developing an automated process which will examine each case and match a person's eligibility for each week of the scheme against their payment history. This is a complex piece of work.  I am advised that the figures requested by the Deputy are not available at this time. </p>  <p>  It will take time to complete the necessary development work to enable the review cases and determine what, if any, arrears are due.  I can assure the Deputies that all cases will be examined and where arrears arise they will be processed and claimants will be notified.  </p>  <p>  In cases where a person supplied incorrect bank details as part of their application for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment they were contacted by my Department and advised that the bank details submitted by them were incorrect.  They were asked to submit a new claim for the payment and provide the correct bank IBAN details in order for their claim to be processed.  Payments which failed due to incorrect IBAN details will be reissued as part of the arrears processing work outlined above.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

However, in parallel with the Intreo service, our contracted public employment services, including JobPath and the Local Employment Services, have resumed activation for new referrals.  It is vital to continue to engage with the long term unemployed and other cohorts to ensure they do not become further distant from the labour market.  This will be undertaken with due regard to public health requirements. </p>  <p>  In common with all contracted public employment services, my Department is examining all options for the provision of services in 2021 with due regard to the significant labour market impacts of Covid-19 and the associated restrictions.</p>  <p>  My Department engaged external consultants in late 2019 to review all current contracted public employment services, including JobPath.  Their report, currently being finalised, will inform the Government's decision on the future structure of all contracted public employment services.  It is essential that we ensure our labour market activation services are fit-for-purpose and provide value for money.  This must be balanced against the pressing need to ensure that these key services are in situ when needed by those who have lost their jobs arising from the economic impact of the pandemic.</p></reply>

It, for the first time, acknowledged home caring periods prior to 1994 and provides for up to 20 years of HomeCaring periods to be considered.  As a result, those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits / HomeCaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Arising from this initiative, the Department reviewed over 94,000 cases resulting in over 38,000 receiving an increased pension payment.  Since April 2019 all new State  Pension (Contributory) applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Interim TCA, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.</p>  <p>  It should be noted if a person does not satisfy those conditions, they may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  The new Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment to introduce a Total Contributions Approach (TCA).  This is intended to be a fairer and more transparent system where the person's lifetime contribution will be more closely reflected in the benefit received.  Furthermore, the Programme commits to the establishment of a new Commission on Pensions to examine sustainability and eligibility issues in relation to State pensions and the Social Insurance Fund.  The Commission is to report to Government by June 2021 on a range of matters including total contributions and eligibility requirements.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Commission is to report to Government by June 2021 on options including the qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements.  The Government will take action, having regard to the recommendations of the Commission, within six months.  Pending the Commission's report and any subsequent Government decisions on its recommendations, it is intended that the State pension age will remain at 66 years.  </p>  <p>  The Programme also proposes an &ldquo;Early Retirement Allowance or Pension&rdquo; for 65 year olds paid at the same rate as Jobseekers Benefit without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

If the employer has had to reduce working days due to the pandemic then the employee may be entitled to apply for short time work support provided that the employer does not receive the Temporary Wage Subsidy in respect of the days that the person is not working.

The High-level Forum included representatives from public service management and union officials.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was undertaken in 2017 with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-14a.2036.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020071400096#WRJJ02300"><p>The Government acknowledges the crucial role that family carers play and is fully committed to supporting carers in that role.  This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion. </p>  <p>  The Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main scheme by which my Department provides income support to carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who require full-time care and attention.  The primary objective of the payment is to provide an income support to carers whose earning capacity is substantially reduced as a consequence of their caring responsibilities and in so doing to support the ongoing care of the person in respect of whom care is being provided.  In doing this it also contributes to recognising the valuable role of carers and helping to maintain people with caring needs in their own homes and communities. </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,500 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance.  A half-rate carer's allowance is also payable with other social welfare payments e.g. pensions and disability payments.  Where carers are providing care to more than one person, an increase of 50% is applicable.  Carers may also (subject to certain conditions) qualify for the:</p>  <p>  - Household Benefits Package</p>  <p>  - Free Travel Scheme</p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, as part of Budget measures 2020 the number of hours that a carer can engage in employment (or education or training) outside the home was increased from 15 hours to 18.5 hours.   </p>  <p>  Other available supports to family carers (that are not means-tested) include:-</p>  <p>  Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant: The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is paid automatically to people in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance. Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full time care and attention are also eligible and can apply for a grant.  The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is an annual payment of &euro;1,700 a year for each care recipient paid in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test.  Some 114,000 carers received the annual Carer's Support Grant on Thursday 4 June, 2020.  The estimated expenditure on the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant this year is &euro;237.32 million.</p>  <p>  Domiciliary Care Allowance: Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  It is not means tested.  The Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is &euro;309.50 per month.  There is no restriction on the number of children for whom a person may claim Domiciliary Care Allowance.  In other words, a person caring for more than one child who qualifies for Domiciliary Care Allowance may claim the monthly  allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the commitment and the key role carers play in society and I will keep the range of supports available to family carers under review.  While I will seek to improve the supports available for carers, any changes must be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

The scheme operates from June to September each year.</p><p>The allowance is payable in respect of eligible children between the ages of 4 and 17 in respect of whom a qualified child allowance is being paid and eligible children between the ages of 18 and 22 who are in full-time second level education and in respect of whom a qualified child allowance is being paid.  </p><p>Similar to previous years, the majority of customers are awarded BSCFA automatically and notification of these awards have issued to these customers. </p><p>Form 6 July, if customers have not received an award letter from BSCFA, the customer will need to apply for the allowance online on www.mywelfare.ie.  If customers are experiencing issues applying online, they can contact the BSCFA section on 071 9193318 or 0818 11 11 13, where an officer can assist the customer to apply online or will issue an application form for the customer to complete. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The main eligibility conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with other qualifying persons.  The fuel allowance means test is linked to the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory).  The applicant and their spouse can have a combined weekly household income of &euro;100.00 above the maximum rates for State pension (contributory) and Increase for qualified adult and still be eligible for a fuel allowance.  </p>  <p>  The person concerned applied for this allowance on 15 July 2019.  At that time their spouse was in receipt of a non-qualifying payment and the fuel allowance application was disallowed. The person was notified in writing of this decision on 23 July 2019 and advised if there were any changes in their circumstances to submit a new application.</p>  <p>  I have arranged for a fuel application form to issue to the person concerned.  On receipt of the completed application their eligibility for this allowance will be re-examined and they will be notified in writing of the decision.</p>  <p>  The person concerned is also in receipt of the Household Benefits Package which entitles them to an electricity allowance and free television licence.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p><p>The operation and administration of the scheme is the responsibility of the school; this includes the delivery model, choice of supplier to be used and food items to be provided.  The scheme can be delivered in a variety of ways and depends on the needs, capabilities and resources, including infrastructure, of the schools or groups.</p><p>Following the announcement of the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic on 12<sup>th</sup>March 2020, schools and organisations participating in the school meals programme expressed concerns about the impact of school closures on pupils who avail of school meals, and that the unavailability of school meals impacts in particular on the most disadvantaged in our society. </p><p>My Department confirmed that funding to schools would continue to enable schools to provide food until the end of the current school year - the end of May 2020 for post-primary schools and the end of June 2020 for primary schools, in line with the parameters of the school meals scheme.  This funding was further extended to allow schools who choose to continue to provide food during the summer period until the start of the new academic year 2020/2021.</p><p>Any schools who wish to avail of additional funding to cover the provision of meals in July and August should contact the school meals section at <i>school.meals@welfare.ie</i>and funding will be reviewed on a case by case basis.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 976,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2020 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  Persons resident in Ireland who are over 66 and persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments are eligible for the scheme.  The social welfare payments that allow persons aged under 66 to a free travel pass include disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance and partial capacity benefit.  Disability allowance and invalidity pension are both long term illness payments, and so people in receipt of those payments will already have eligibility. </p>  <p>  Any possible extension to the eligibility criteria for free travel, including to those who are not allowed to drive due to their epilepsy diagnosis, would have significant cost implications for the free travel scheme and would also require additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Any decision to do so could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme (SWA), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement, in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes the decision taken at the beginning of the pandemic to allow for key family social welfare payments such as One-Parent Family Payment and Working Family Payment to be paid concurrently with the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides financial supports to families and their children through the Increase for a Qualified Child, which is paid in addition to primary social welfare payments such as the Working Family Payment, Child Benefit and One-parent Family Payment.  In addition, families on low income may be eligible for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.  The School Meals programme has also been extended for the summer months as a direct response to potential food poverty being experienced by children at this challenging time.</p>  <p>  For those who are not eligible for these supports, they may be able to receive financial support from the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, we know that households where adults are in employment are less likely to experience child poverty; therefore the Government will continue to work to support to creation of jobs and the reopening of the economy in line with public health advice. </p></reply>

Benefits are intended to replace lost income where a person is, for some reason, not able to engage with the labour force. Invalidity Pension, for example, is payable where a person is permanently incapable of work. Where there is no recent history of contributions being paid or credited then there is no entitlement to most benefits.</p>  <p>  Invalidity pension is a substantial and long-term payment for persons who are permanently incapable of work and who satisfy the social insurance conditions. A total of 260 weeks contributions paid and 48 weeks contributions paid or credited in the last complete tax year before the relevant date or in the tax year before the last complete tax year are required to satisfy the PRSI conditions for Invalidity Pension. The reckonable contribution classes are A, E, H and S. </p>  <p>  A person may keep up their contribution record in a number of ways. One of these is by credited contributions. A credited contribution is a PRSI contribution awarded to an insured person under certain circumstances, such as proved unemployment. Credited contributions are an integral part of the social insurance system. For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave. The primary purpose of credited contributions is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc. Credits ensure that a person&rsquo;s insurance record is maintained and can be helpful at a later stage to qualify for other social welfare benefits, such as pensions or to increase the rate of pension that may become payable. </p>  <p>  Appropriate social insurance contributions paid in another European Union Member-State can count for the purpose of bridging a contribution gap &ndash; provided that one social insurance contribution is made in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Persons who have an insufficient contribution record to qualify for a social insurance benefit may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme. For example persons, between the ages of 16 and 66 who are suffering from an illness or disability which is expected to last at least 1 year, may qualify for disability allowance. Disability allowance recipients must be habitually resident in the State. </p></reply>

The person&rsquo;s pension entitlement was reviewed on 3 July 2020; they are in receipt of the correct rate of State pension (contributory), commensurate with their insurance record.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment was introduced as an emergency measure so that payments could be made as quickly as possible to the large number of people who became fully unemployed due to the pandemic. In common with general jobseeker's payments, the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is payable to people between the ages of 18 and 66. Accordingly, once the person concerned reached pension age, they were no longer eligible for this income support.</p>  <p>  Employers in Ireland can claim the temporary wage subsidy for all of their workers, who pay Irish PAYE income tax, from the Revenue Commissioners.  In this way workers who are aged over 66 can continue, with the co-operation of their employers, to receive employment income of at least 70% of their normal wage. Further information on the supports available to employees and employers in relation to COVID-19 can be found at www.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  Recipients of state pension payments may, depending on their individual circumstances, have access to a range of other income supports not available to unemployed people &ndash; including the free fuel allowance, the living alone increase, the household benefits package (gas/electricity), the telephone support allowance, free travel and the free TV licence.</p>  <p>  The person concerned may wish to consider applying for State pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested, residency-based payment for people of pension age.  Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the applicant (and spouse/civil partner/cohabitant as applicable).  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.  </p>  <p>  The living alone increase has been awarded to the person concerned with their State pension (contributory).  Free travel has also been awarded. </p>  <p>  Since fuel allowance is a means-tested payment, information regarding the person's means (bank statements) was requested on 8 June 2020, and again on 10 July 2020.  When this information is received, the person's eligibility for fuel allowance can be determined and they will be notified of the outcome.  Where a customer is eligible for both the living alone increase and fuel allowance, they automatically qualify for a telephone support allowance. </p>  <p>  I have arranged for application forms for the Household Benefits Package and the State pension (non-contributory) to be issued. As soon as these applications are completed and returned, the person&rsquo;s eligibility for these respective schemes will be determined and they will be notified in writing of the outcome.  If assessed with an entitlement to State pension (non-contributory) at a higher rate than their current State pension (contributory) payment, the person will be awarded the more financially beneficial pension.  Both pensions cannot be paid concurrently. </p>  <p>  Where someone is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for assistance through the means tested Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  Queries in relation to eligibility should be made by phone to their local Intreo Centre.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

People aged 66 years and over are provided for within the Social Protection income support framework through the State Pension, either the contributory State pension based on PRSI contributions or the non-contributory means tested pension.</p>  <p>  A person in receipt of the State contributory pension can retain all of their State pension as well as their employment income and retain that pension payment if they lose employment income, thus guaranteeing an income support.  If a person is not in receipt of the maximum rate of State Pension Contributory, they may be eligible for an increased weekly rate of payment on the State non-contributory means tested pension, depending on their circumstances.  A person may also be entitled to an increase in respect of a qualified adult, subject to the means of the qualified adult. </p>  <p>  People in receipt of the non-contributory or means-tested pension who are also in receipt of an employment income may have their pension payment increased if they lose that employment income or it is reduced.  Similarly, if a person aged 66 or over who did not previously qualify for or make an application for a means-tested pension may qualify for a pension payment if their circumstances change &ndash; including if they lose any employment income or if that employment income is reduced.  A person may be entitled to claim for an increase in respect of a qualified adult up to age 66 years depending on the specific circumstances.  </p>  <p>  People aged 66 and over may also be entitled to a range of ancillary supports that are aligned to the particular circumstances of older people and are significantly more valuable than those generally available to people of working age. These include free travel, fuel allowance, household benefits package (gas/electricity) and living alone allowance. </p>  <p>  It should be noted also that employers may claim the temporary wage subsidy for all of their workers who pay Irish PAYE income tax from the Revenue Commissioners.  In this way workers who are aged over 66 can continue, with the co-operation of their employers, to receive income from employment. </p>  <p>  A person of any age who is experiencing financial hardship may access assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme including Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

A cessation in income generating activities and fundraising, as a consequence of COVID-19 restrictions, has severely impacted many of these same organisations. </p>  <p>  My Department has responded to the urgent needs of charities, community and voluntary organisations and social enterprises experiencing such financial difficulties. There has been no reduction in the funding awarded to charities from my Department, with some additional financial supports being introduced with this critical need in mind. </p>  <p>  In conjunction, new flexibilities have also been implemented in existing support schemes and programmes, supporting these organisations to find new and innovative ways of adapting and delivering essential services in a changing economic and societal landscape. </p>  <p>  In April 2020, my Department launched a &euro;2.5 million COVID-19 Emergency Fund for those groups taking part in the &lsquo;Community Call&rsquo;. Administered through the Local Authorities, this initiative was an immediate response to support the emergency efforts by community and voluntary groups in assisting people at a local level.</p>  <p>  Separately, my Department introduced a &euro;40 million package of supports for community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises. The &euro;35 million COVID-19 Stability Fund delivers a once-off cash injection to those organisations providing critical front-line services to the most at need in our society and are in danger of imminent closure due to lost fund-raised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19. The first tranche of this fund, totalling &euro;10.5 million, was allocated in late June 2020 to 179 qualifying organisations.</p>  <p>  &euro;5 million has also been committed to The Innovate Together Fund, which is also accepting philanthropic donations. The focus of this Fund is on responses to the COVID-19 crisis that will deliver innovative and adaptive solutions to existing and emerging social challenges. These innovations will support the most vulnerable in our society, those most affected by the crisis and will ultimately help to make our society more inclusive, equal and sustainable.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that significant challenges remain for community and voluntary groups and charities during this time. Collaboration and partnership between the sector and the State are key to co-ordinating and responding to the needs of our communities. My Department will continue to work closely with the sector in managing through these challenges over the coming months.</p></reply>

In that context my Department is providing funding supports to organisations through a number of different schemes. </p><p>The Community and Voluntary Sector Covid-19 Stability Fund is intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups currently delivering critical front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fund-raised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19. </p><p>This fund will provide &euro;35 million of funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF) and the criteria align with DAF objectives to support: </p><p>1. The personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; o</p><p>2. The educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged; or</p><p>3. Persons with a disability.</p><p>Over one thousand applications were received during the application period. Due to the considerable interest in the Stability Scheme and in order to ensure that funding is released as quickly as possible, applicants were considered in smaller groupings. </p><p>The first tranche of funding was announced on Friday 26 June last, with 179 organisations being awarded &euro;10.5 million in funding, the full list can be found at the following link:</p><p>. </p><p>Decisions on further tranches are being now being considered.</p><p>The Innovate Together Fund was opened on 13 May 2020. The focus of the Fund is on supporting innovative responses to the Covid-19 crisis and is supported by a commitment of &euro;5 million from my Department via the Dormant Accounts Fund. Social Innovation Fund Ireland pledges to raise additional philanthropic funds for this initiative and is responsible for the administration of the Fund with oversight from my Department. Applications are open to established charities, social enterprises and to local, regional and national voluntary groups and organisations who are based in Ireland and who are delivering services to the most vulnerable communities immediately impacted by COVID-19. The first round of funding under this fund is now closed and applications are being assessed. Further rounds of funding will be announced in due course. </p><p>The Community Enhancement Programme provides small capital grants to community groups to improve facilities in their area, and the 2020 Programme was launched recently with funding of &euro;2m. The Department gives flexibility to Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) to tailor the programme in each Local Authority area, so that it meets local priorities. It is recommended that applicants contact the LCDC in their area for further details. </p><p>The Community Services Programme (CSP), currently supports over 400 community organisations and my Department is fully committed to continuing to support those organisations. My Department has put in place an additional Support Fund for 2020 which will provide additional funding for a number of weeks to many of these organisations, ensuring that they can pay their full-time CSP supported employees a maximum of &euro;350 net per week, with a proportionate amount for part-time CSP supported employees.  </p><p>In addition to the measures which have been introduced by my Department for community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises, the Government has put in place a range of supports and guidance for businesses impacted by COVID-19. </p><p>A downloadable guide to these supports and their eligibility criteria is available at the link:</p><p> . </p><p>Details of enhanced government supports for businesses announced on 2 May 2020 are available at the link:</p><p>. </p><p>Inquiries can be directed to the relevant contact points listed in the material.</p><p>My Department is continuing to liaise with representatives of the community and voluntary, charity and social enterprise sectors and with other Departments with relevant policy responsibility in relation to the challenges faced at this time. Assurances have been provided in relation to the continuation of exchequer funding supports for organisations in the sector. It is also worth mentioning that the Government Wage Subsidy Scheme will support employers in the sector to retain staff who are employed under non-Exchequer funding sources</p></reply>

I met, by video link, with the Fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius on Friday 10 July last. I discussed with the Commissioner the importance of the agreed EU negotiation mandate that sets down clearly the EU objective to &ldquo;uphold existing reciprocal access conditions, quota shares and traditional activity of the Union fleet&rdquo;.  I also discussed the centrality of the link between the overall economic partnership and the conclusion of a fishing agreement. </p>  <p>  This was a very useful first discussion with Commissioner Sinkevicius and it was important to be able to talk first hand with the Commissioner about Ireland's concerns in relation to the potential negative impacts for our fishing communities in Ireland if we do not put in place a fair and balanced Fisheries Agreement with the UK.  I reiterated this Government&rsquo;s full support for the EU negotiating mandate and my confidence that the Commissioner and Michel Barnier will continue to be strong defenders of Irish and EU fishing interests. </p>  <p>  I will be meeting with representatives from the fishing industry, including from the Irish South &amp;amp; East Fish Producers Organisation, this week to discuss their concerns in respect of fisheries and the UK's withdrawal from the EU.</p>  <p>  It is evident that progress on fisheries has been disappointing so far. This is one of the most difficult areas under negotiation. Fisheries is an important priority for Ireland. We are seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in terms of both access and the quota share it currently enjoys in UK waters. From the outset of the negotiations, Ireland and our EU partners have been clear on our level of ambition in this area and on the fact that progress on an overall trade deal is linked to progress on fisheries. This is reflected in the EU mandate and the draft EU legal text. The EU position was the result of considerable internal discussion and reflects a delicate balance. In sum, we are seeking to uphold continued levels of reciprocal access and stable quotas. The UK Government has a very different approach. They emphasise their status as a &ldquo;coastal independent state&rdquo; and insist that new arrangements should be based on annual negotiations, which follow the principle of zonal attachment. Clearly, the two sides are still very far apart. This is very concerning to us &ndash; as is reflected in the EU mandate, one of our key priorities is to avoid economic dislocation for Union fishermen that have operated in UK waters. This remains our collective approach. The Task Force is continuing to push for better UK engagement on this area. </p>  <p>  Michel Barnier has reiterated that he has a very clear mandate regarding the fisheries sector. He has also been crystal clear that fisheries is an integral part of the negotiations and cannot be separated from progress on other trade issues. Mr Barnier met in late May with fisheries Ministers, where there was clear consensus, including from Ireland, on continued support for the EU mandate&rsquo;s position on fisheries. The Government fully supports Mr Barnier in his role and we remain confident that Irish and EU fisheries interests will continue to be protected after the transition period has ended.  </p></reply>

I have asked officials in my Department to undertake preliminary reports on the farming and forestry related impacts on the bog slide and I have been liaising with my colleague Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, on this matter.  In the first instance, the broader inquiry and issues arising from the bog slide are a matter for the Leitrim Country Council, and I will continue to liaise with officials in this regard.</p>  <p>  I have assured farmers that their direct payment scheme payments are covered by the existing force majeure regulations in place.  The terms and conditions for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme include provision for force majeure cases, and these provisions would include instances such as the recent bog slide.  Where a farmer is concerned that this event might have an impact on their scheme payments, they should contact the Department to inform it of the circumstances of their own case and to provide any evidence  of the impact on their own landholding (Geotag Photos).  Farmers can write to the Direct Payments Unit, Government Offices, Abbeyleix Road, Portlaoise or ring 076 106 4420.  This will ensure that the Department is aware of cases which may be impacted and all such cases will be examined individually.  </p></reply>

Kerry. </p>  <p>  Under this project, ring-barking is applied to young conifer stems to create open space around existing birch trees, thereby enabling the natural regeneration of the birch. The application is repeated over a number of years until eventually the &lsquo;halos&rsquo; of emerging birch merge, thereby resulting in the ecologically-sensitive transformation of the conifer stand into native woodland. Ring-barking is also described in the draft Plan for Forests and Freshwater Pearl Mussel (FPM) in Ireland, released by the Department in mid-2018, as a prescription for the gradual elimination of individual and small groups of trees, in areas where their sudden removal by felling would be harmful to FPM. </p>  <p>  Ring-barking would not be considered as normal forest practice and would only be acceptable in very limited circumstances, such as those described above. </p>  <p>  A tree felling licence is required where a tree is to be felled or caused to fall (regardless of the methods used) and must be granted before any management operation takes place. </p></reply>

My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. </p>  <p>  The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. As you know, my Department is the forestry licence consent authority and, since 2017, all licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  </p>  <p>  I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences. It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place. Citizens are, of course, perfectly entitled to appeal licensing decisions, but since the introduction of modifications in the licensing process, the majority of my Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee.  This gives confidence in these revised procedures. </p>  <p>  We now have a project plan for dealing with the current backlog and new files, which includes extra resources as follows:  </p>  <p>  - Nine new forestry inspectors will be recruited in 2020, and four temporary forestry inspectors have been recruited,  to work on licensing. </p>  <p>  - Three new ecologists have joined the Department ecology team, with three more to be appointed shortly.</p>  <p>  - We have engaged external ecological expertise to help with the backlog of files.  Four local ecologists have also been contracted provide extra support.  Further, an ecology contract with five new ecologists has been started.</p>  <p>  - Additional administrative staff have been assigned to the Agriculture Appeals Office to assist with the increased workload of the Forestry Appeals Committee.  </p>  <p>  - Three planning officers have been contracted in to work with the Forestry Appeals Committee.</p>  <p>  - A specialist mapping expert has been assigned to forestry. </p>  <p>  The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  A categorisation of files, in terms of size and proximity to European designated sites,  has been conducted so that those likely to have a similar effect on the environment may be grouped together.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.  </p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project. While  much of the success  of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it. This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit only applications which have a realistic chance of being planted, to ensure all applications are of the required standard and quality, and  to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided. </p>  <p>  I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p>  <p>  The issue of third-party appeals is an independent process run by the Forestry Appeals Committee and which is independent of my Department.  </p></reply>

Felling licences are now valid for up to 10 years and may cover several felling events, such as thinning then clear felling on the same plot.  Landowners considering future operations, have the opportunity of applying for a tree felling licence well in advance of any operations taking place.  </p><p>I am acutely aware that delays in issuing licences has led to difficulties for some in the sector, although of course not all licence are used immediately.  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues.  The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  </p><p>I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences. It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place. My Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee, which gives confidence in these revised procedures. </p><p>My Department now have a project plan for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant extra resources as follows:  </p><p>- Nine new forestry inspectors will be recruited in 2020, and four temporary forestry inspectors have been recruited,  to work on licensing. </p><p>- Three new ecologists have joined the Department ecology team, with three more to be appointed shortly.</p><p>- We have engaged external ecological expertise to help with the backlog of files.  Four local ecologists have also been contracted provide extra support.  Further, an ecology contract with five new ecologists has been started.</p><p>- Additional administrative staff have been assigned to the Agriculture Appeals Office to assist with the increased workload of the Forestry Appeals Committee.  </p><p>- Three planning officers have been contracted in to work with the Forestry Appeals Committee.</p><p>- A specialist mapping expert has been assigned to forestry. </p><p>The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.  </p><p>A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project. While much of the success  of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it. This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit only applications which have a realistic chance of being planted, to ensure all applications are of the required standard and quality, and  to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided.</p><p>I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p><p>The table below shows applications received, licences issued and applications still outstanding for 2018, 2019 and to 30th June, 2020. Note: the &quot;outstanding&quot; figure applies to applications received in that year which have yet to be licensed.  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications received</td>       <td>6,600</td>       <td>3,175</td>       <td>758</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Licences issued</td>       <td>3,603</td>       <td>4,098</td>       <td>823</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Outstanding </td>       <td>300</td>       <td>1,484</td>       <td>580</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Commission proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. Indeed, three of the nine objectives of the CAP relate to the achievement of a higher level of environment and climate ambition, including in relation to the protection of biodiversity and the preservation of habitats and landscapes.</p>  <p>  The proposals provide for additional discretion for Member States in configuring the measures available, within parameters which are laid down in the draft proposals.  Taking this balanced approach, the new CAP is intended to provide for appropriate national flexibility while also maintaining a common approach and a level playing field. It is an approach that Ireland supports.  The CAP already supports locally-led environmental and other measures and the new arrangements will continue to do so. </p>  <p>  Negotiations are continuing under the German Presidency.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work closely with the Presidency, my European counterparts and the European Commission to ensure that the next CAP continues to provide necessary support and the best possible outcome for Ireland's farmers and agriculture sector.</p></reply>

As you may be aware, changes have been made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP) in relation to these decisions. These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable and assessment now requires significant ecological input. </p>  <p>  In order to deliver on these new requirements, my Department has and is recruiting additional resources including ecologists, as follows:</p>  <p>  - Three new permanent ecologists have joined the Department ecology team, with three more to be appointed shortly.</p>  <p>  - We have also engaged external ecological expertise to help with the backlog of files.  Four local ecologists have also been contracted provide extra support.  Further, an ecology contract with five new ecologists has been started.</p>  <p>  A project plan is now in place for dealing with licence applications and aims to make best use of these resources in order to increase the number of licences issued. We are keeping resources under continuous review to ensure that they are sufficient to deliver the plan. </p>  <p>  In terms of the cost of estimated cost of additional full-time ecologists, the first point of the pay scale for ecologists recruited to the Department, including the 2% increase due in October 2020, is &euro;34,651. To employ 9 ecologists for one year based on current salary levels is &euro;311,000.</p>  <p>  This figure only represents the cost for the year 2021 and would obviously rise incrementally in subsequent years if the recruited ecologists were to be retained. </p></reply>

Piloting Baby Boxes is just one initiative which is part of a wide ranging strategy addressing various aspects of the lives of children from birth to age five including supports for parents to balance working and caring, developments in early learning and care and health initiatives.</p>  <p>  The gift of the Baby Box is intended as a welcome from the State for a new arrival to a family and an acknowledgement of this very significant moment for parents. The universal distribution of Baby Boxes also reflects an important equality principle that each child is given something of equal value at the start of their life. The concept of Baby Boxes originates in Finland (and has been implemented in a number of other countries) and consists of a package of items to assist with the transition to parenthood. The pilot will undertake research and consultation to determine items for inclusion in the pack and these may include safety items, baby clothes and toys to support early development and books to foster a love of reading from infancy.</p>  <p>  The distribution of a Baby Box also offers the opportunity to communicate important child development and safety messages to parents as well as an early opportunity to link families in with support services if required. This is consistent with the principle of progressive universalism whereby all families receive something universally, but where there are additional needs, extra supports are provided.</p>  <p>  Key objectives with the Baby Box and linked communications will include support for parent-infant bonding, information on baby development and early learning, advice and support for breastfeeding and promotion of infant health and safety.</p>  <p>  Baby Boxes will be piloted in parallel with Book Bags to support early literacy and the home learning environment. Book Bags are packs including books for children and other resources to support reading and learning. It is intended that Book Bags would be made available free of charge to families with young children at key points in a child&rsquo;s life such as infancy, the transition to pre-school and the transition to primary school.</p>  <p>  A research partner will be appointed, following competitive tender, to support work on the baby box pilot. The research partner will oversee focus groups and/or consultations for the selection of items for the box. The implementation of the pilot including delivery channels and selection and registration of participants will also be evaluated by the research partner. There will be a significant emphasis in the pilot on consultation and engagement with parents and of evaluation of the impact of such measures, including cost-benefit analysis, with a view to determining whether the baby box pilot initiative is suitable for wider roll-out.  The results of the evaluation will be published as a report some months after the final distribution of the boxes. This will allow for a period of time for participants to fully utilise items in the boxes before reporting on their experience.  </p>  <p>  The scoping phase of the pilot began in late 2019/early 2020 and a working group will be convened in Q4 2020 to plan for the pilot implementation. </p>  <p>  There are some baby box schemes already in operation via maternity hospitals and otherwise in different parts of the country but my Department is not involved in funding or co-ordinating these.</p></reply>

Similarly, where employment ceases any associated impact on pension rights may be communicated with regard to this framework. The determination of what constitutes employment for the purposes of calculating contributions for the State pension(s) is a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  To assist foster carers in their role, foster carers receive the Foster Care Allowance in respect of each child they are caring for. At &euro;325 per week per child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week per child aged 12 and over, this allowance is a significant fiscal support. </p>  <p>  This allowance is not a salary. It is a payment made in respect of the child to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sporting activities. It is tax free and is not considered as means for Social Welfare purposes. Therefore, it can be availed of by foster carers regardless of their income or employment status. It is thus a very flexible support which reflects the variety in the life and circumstances of the thousands of people in Ireland who are foster carers.</p>  <p>  In addition to the allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. In addition, Tusla provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association, which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a phone advice service.</p>  <p>  Changes to the law in relation to credits for pension purposes are a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p></reply>

In accordance with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, and guided by the expert advice of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSPC), ELC and SAC services can resume from 29 June. Government has committed a &euro;75m package of funding for reopening services over the summer months. This substantial investment recognises the important role that the ELC and SAC sector plays in the societal and economic infrastructure of the country. </p>  <p>  The new funding package contains four significant elements:</p>  <p>  - A once-off Reopening Support Payment (RSP) for DCYA-funded service providers opening between 29 June and early September.</p>  <p>  - A once-off COVID-19 capital grant for DCYA-funded service providers opening between 29 June and early September.</p>  <p>  - Continued access for eligible service providers to the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)</p>  <p>  - Resumption of DCYA ELC and SAC programmes. NCS, CCSP and TEC will be available again for children attending ELC and SAC services from 29 June.</p>  <p>  In developing the funding package, my Department recognises that a reduced number of children are likely to attend ELC and SAC services in the initial weeks of reopening. This funding package is tailored to allow providers to operate with potentially less parental income and to assist in meeting the possible costs associated with complying with public health requirements.</p>  <p>   Pobal has informed my Department that the service in question has signed up for the RSP and COVID-19 Capital Grant, and will continue to operate CCSP and NCS. </p>  <p>  It is a condition of the RSP scheme that participating services must apply the Registered Fees List that was in place on March 12th 2020, without amendments, for the duration of the scheme. Where possible services are requested to avoid charging fees, deposits or other measures to hold places creating a strain for families in difficult circumstances. If a service provider feels that these measures are necessary, then they should be as minimal as possible.</p>  <p>  My Department takes compliance with scheme rules seriously, and will work with Pobal to institute checks on service providers participating in this funding package. This includes following-up where a potential breach of scheme rules, as in this instance, is brought to my Department's or Pobal's attention.

Such services may also be eligible to continue to avail of the TWSS.</p><p>If a service provider is facing difficulties in reopening they can apply to their local County Childcare Committee (CCC) who can provide them with expert advice and support.  Services which are operated by community non-for-profit providers can also access sustainability funding from my Department.</p><p>If a parent needs assistance in finding a ECCE place for their child, they can approach their local CCC for advice on ECCE options in their area.

This query was not responded to.</p>  <p>  Further to this, in April 2019, a general message was sent by Pobal to all services with a queried status on their higher capitation application. Pobal received an initial response from the service enquiring as to why their higher capitation status was queried. Pobal replied on 25th April 2019 to the service explaining what additional information was required. This message was not responded to and the application was not amended within the programme year which closed in late June 2019.</p>  <p>  Pobal confirmed that the application was re-submitted on the 30th August 2019 but as this was well outside of the submission period, the application was declined. Upon an inquiry by the service, Pobal referred the case to my Department who advised Pobal to maintain the original decision due to the fact that the service did not address the outstanding issues within the programme year.</p>  <p>  It must be noted that for applications submitted in the 2018/2019 programme year, significant additional flexibility was afforded by Pobal, allowing services until the 2nd August 2019 to address any outstanding issues with their Higher Capitation applications. Services were informed of this extension through the relevant channels.</p>  <p>  Whilst my Department understands the pressures on service providers, the responsibility for ensuring applications are submitted correctly and on time lies with the service. Further, the documents requested by Pobal should have been readily available to the service as they would have been required for any applications made in previous years and are also required to be on-site for the purposes of inspection.</p></reply>

If the parents can agree an alternative safe carer with Tusla, then Tusla will review this, and may develop an agreement for that person(s) to become the primary carer, until such time as the child&rsquo;s own parent(s) are able to demonstrate that changes are in place to allow for them to provide the necessary safe care. If, however, the parent(s) cannot agree how to do this, it is sometimes necessary to involve the Court to adjudicate on such a decision.  In all such cases, under the Child Care Act, the best interests of the child must be the paramount consideration.</p>  <p>  All parents whose children are in care are entitled to make applications for family contact (known as access) and the needs of the child, including breastfeeding infants, inform plans for family contact. Access arrangements may also be adjudicated if no mutual agreement is reached between the parent(s) and Tusla.</p></reply>

However, based on figures available to my Department, of approximately 26,000 staff working directly with children, it is estimated that 60% (or 15,600) are paid below &euro;12.30 per hour and 40% (or 10,400) are paid &euro;12.30 or more. It is estimated that 83% (or 21,647) of staff working directly with children are paid below &euro;15 hour per hour and 17% (or 4,353) are paid &euro;15 hour or more hour.</p><p>On this basis, it can be estimated that the annual cost of raising the wages of all early learning and care practitioners to at least &euro;12.30 per hour would be approximately &euro;30 million. This figure represents an average increase of 12% in gross pay. The additional cost to employers for this in terms of employer PRSI and holiday pay would be &euro;6m &ndash; bringing the total cost to &euro;36m.</p><p>The annual cost of paying &euro;15 hour per hour to staff currently paid below this rate is estimated to be &euro;103 million. This estimate assumes that the number of hours worked remains unchanged and represents an average increase of 30% in gross pay. The additional cost to employers for this in terms of Employer PRSI and holiday pay would be &euro;21m &ndash; bring a total cost of this to &euro;124m.</p><p>The average overall turnover rate for full-time only services per year is as follows:</p><p>- 2018/2019 &ndash; 40.17%</p><p>- 2017/2018 &ndash; 46.37%</p><p>- 2016/2017 &ndash; 36.79%</p><p>According to Pobal&rsquo;s Annual Early Years Sector Profile Report for the 2018/2019 programme year, the average overall turnover rate was 23.4%. When broken down, this shows that 20% of services lost 1 member of staff, 14% lost 2 or 3 members of staff and a further 7% lost more than 3 staff members. It is important to note that 59% of services retained all of their staff members.</p><p>For the 2017/2018 programme year the figures are similar. In that year, the overall turnover rate was 24.7%, with 23% of services losing 1 member of staff, 14% losing 2 or 3 members of staff and 6% losing more than 3 staff. In this year, 57% of services indicated that they retained all of their staff.</p><p>For the year 2016/2017, the overall turnover rate was 28.2%, showing that the overall turnover rate has improved slightly. A breakdown of the figures for this year is not available. Further, there is no similar data on previous programme years.</p><p>In terms of the percentage of services who recorded a staff turnover rate greater than 80% per year, this data is not available but would be highly dependent on the size of each service. Such a rate would be outside the average rates which are more representative of the overall situation experienced in the sector.</p></reply>

Data also indicates that of all income earned by providers in the sector, 58% comes from the State, with the balance coming from parental income.

The services can re-register the child using the same award once that award hasn't expired. Applicants whose awards have expired will already have been informed of this and the steps to renew their award. All of this cohort have MyGovID accounts already.</p>  <p>  For completely new applicants who already hold a Public Services Card and a basic MyGovID account, they can still create a MyGovID verified account, and thereby complete an online application for the National Childcare Scheme. Details on how to do this can be found by logging into a MyGovID basic account, available at www.mygovid.ie.</p>  <p>  For new applicants who may be unable to follow this process, they can apply for the National Childcare Scheme without obtaining a Public Services Card, by completing a paper application form by post. For information on how to apply by post, parents can contact the Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm. </p>  <p>  Parents will not be reimbursed for any period before they are awarded a childcare subsidy. It has always been communicated by my Department that subsidy awards are payable from the week they are claimed, and not the date of application. It is a key aspect of the scheme that all claims are paid in arrears based on the attendance of a child. As such, the child must be registered with a childcare provider and the provider must confirm that attendance. This is a key financial and governance control to ensure we are maximising the benefits of public monies and that the investment is following the child.</p>  <p>  Further information and resources for parents are available at www.ncs.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth.  Any amendment to the legislation governing the provision of maternity leave, which falls under my responsibility, would require primary legislation.  The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the particular challenges that mothers and parents have faced during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government is considering a proposal to advance the extension of Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit to five weeks for all parents of children born after 1 November 2019, to enable every eligible parent of young children to spend additional time with their child.</p>  <p>  At present, Parent&rsquo;s Leave entitles each parent to 2 weeks&rsquo; leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, or in the case of adoption, within one year of the placement of the child with the family. </p>  <p>  The Government proposal would mean that eligible parents of children born during the pandemic crisis will get an extra three weeks of Parent&rsquo;s Leave to offset the impact of having a child during the strict lockdown measures. The period in which Parent&rsquo;s Leave can be taken will also be extended from one year to two years.  This will be considered as part of the Budget 2021 process.  The support is paid at a rate of &euro;245 per week.</p>  <p>  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday. </p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, to attempt to minimise the negative impact on the labour market through an exceptional period beginning on 26 March and scheduled to run for an initial period of 12 weeks.</p>  <p>  On 3 June, the Government announced the TWSS would accommodate the salaries of parents returning from maternity or adoptive leave. This will be provided for by way of amendment in the Finance Bill 2020 process, and that in the meantime Revenue will implement the provision from 26 March, where applicable.</p></reply>

The Board delivers these services through directly employed solicitors in its network of law centres around the country and private solicitors from its private practitioner panels. </p><p>Section 3(3) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 provides that the Legal Aid Board shall, subject to the provisions of the Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions.  To be of assistance to the Deputy, however, I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board and am advised as follows:</p><p>Applicants for legal aid must meet the financial eligibility criteria under section 29 of the Act and the Regulations.  This provides that their disposable income (less certain allowances) must be below &euro;18,000 and their disposable capital (less certain allowances and excluding the value of the home in which they live) must be below &euro;100,000.</p><p>The Regulations make detailed provision for what is to be taken into account as income. In particular, Regulation 13(8) provides that:</p><p>&ldquo;&ldquo;income&quot;, in relation to an applicant, means the income which he or she may reasonably expect to receive from all sources&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The effect of Regulation 13(8) is effectively that all income an applicant receives from whatever source must be taken into account unless it is specifically excluded. In addition Regulations 15(1)(e) states as follows:</p><p>&ldquo;Subject to paragraph (8) of Regulation 13 and paragraph (6) of Regulation 16, 'income' shall include_</p><p>(e) the value of other benefits or privileges including the value of free or partly free board&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Taking into account the above Regulations and in the absence of any provision specifically excluding Housing Assistance Payment as income, the Legal Aid Board is required to take Housing Assistance Payment (including Homeless HAP) into account as a form of income. </p><p>Any applicant who is aggrieved by any decision of the Board is entitled to seek an internal review of the decision within one month of the date of the decision and to submit further information in support of such a review. They are also entitled to appeal the matter to an appeal committee consisting of non-executive members of the Legal Aid Board.</p><p>The Board periodically brings proposals to my Department in relation to the financial eligibility and other criteria in relation to civil legal aid. The Legal Aid Board has provided a submission to my Department in regard to financial eligibility criteria for legal aid, including in regard to HAP payments, which is under consideration by my officials.</p></reply>

The granting or refusal of a Labour Market Access permission has no impact on the determination of an international protection application. </p>  <p>  The European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018, transposing the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive, came into effect from 30 June 2018. The Regulations included access to the labour market for eligible international protection applicants. The Regulations provide access to both employment and to self-employment.  Any applicant who has not received a first instance decision within 9 months can make an application for a labour market access permission.</p>  <p>  If the application is successful, a labour market access permission, once granted, is valid for 6 months from the date of issue and can be renewed until a final decision is made on an applicant&rsquo;s international protection application. There is no time limit or obligation for a person to seek employment while holding such a permission. </p>  <p>  The permission expires immediately if the applicant gets a final negative decision within the six month period. If the applicant is still awaiting a first instance decision after the expiry of the six month period, the permission may be renewable.  Application for a renewal of the permission must be submitted to the Labour Market Access Unit of the Immigration Service of my Department one month in advance of the expiry date.</p>  <p>  At the end of last year, my Department commenced work on a review of access to the labour market for international protections applicants. To date, the review has involved consultation with other divisions within the Department and with some key external stakeholders such as Ibec. It also involved a review of the submissions on labour market access made to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality in connection with its report on Direct Provision and the International Protection Process published in December 2019. The review is currently being finalised by my Department and I expect to receive it shortly for consideration. </p>  <p>  Last year, Dr Catherine Day was asked to bring together an expert group with representation from asylum seekers and NGOs to examine best practice in other European States in the provision of services to international protection applicants, to examine likely longer term trends and to set out recommendations and solutions. The work of the group is advancing at pace and their report is expected by the end of September.  A briefing paper on the work of the group, prepared by the Chairperson to inform programme for government talks, was recently circulated to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas by the previous Minister.  This includes a list of measures, identified so far, which would immediately improve the situation of those currently in direct provision including extending the right to work.   This will also inform the review mentioned above.</p></reply>

The Government is also committed to ending the Direct Provision system within the lifetime of the Government and to replacing it with a new international protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach. Last year, Dr Catherine Day was asked to bring together an expert group with representation from asylum seekers and NGOs to examine best practice in other European States in the provision of services to international protection applicants, to examine likely longer term trends and to set out recommendations and solutions. Any new system for the provision of accommodation and additional supports to international protection applicants will be informed by the Report of this Expert Group.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the accommodation system is transferring from my Department to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and officials from both Departments are making the necessary arrangements to facilitate the transfer of functions.  </p>  <p>  Where responsibility for a matter is transferred between Departments, in line with the Transfer of Functions Guidelines, the resources to implement that responsibility (including staff, pay, non-pay or programme spend) also transfer.  The Guidelines state that further revised estimates, amended estimates or a supplementary estimate, as appropriate, will be prepared to take account of changes in function.</p>  <p>  Once a plan to implement the commitment to end the use of the direct provision system of accommodation and other State supports in the Programme for Government is determined by Government, it will be possible for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to cost the proposed alternative.</p></reply>

It is also committed to ending the current system of directly providing accommodation and other State supports to applicants for international protection within the lifetime of the Government and to replacing it with a new international protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach.  Responsibility for the accommodation system is transferring from my Department to the Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration and officials from both Departments are making the necessary arrangements to facilitate the transfer of functions.  </p>  <p>  Last year, Dr Catherine Day was asked to bring together an expert group with representation from asylum seekers and NGOs to examine best practice in other European States in the provision of services to international protection applicants, to examine likely longer term trends and to set out recommendations and solutions. Any new system for the provision of accommodation and additional supports to international protection applicants will be informed by the Report of this Expert Group.</p>  <p>  The Group is examining both the reception system for accommodating applicants and the system for processing applications, and is expected to make recommendations for changes in both areas. A briefing paper on the work of the group, prepared by the Chairperson to inform programme for government talks, was recently circulated to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas by the previous Minister.  The work of the group is advancing at pace and their report is expected by the end of September. </p>  <p>  The intention as stated in the Programme for Government is to publish a White Paper by the end of this year, informed by the recommendations of the Expert Group, which will set out how a replacement to the Direct Provision system will be structured and the steps to achieving it. It will be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to progress the matter following the transfer of this function to his Department.</p></reply>

The current Irish Prison Service Complaints Policy is available on the website www.irishprisons.ie. </p><p>As set out in more detail in that policy, all prisoners have the right to make a complaint at any time and all complaints are treated with the utmost seriousness. The current system categorises complaints according to their nature and seriousness, ranging from the most serious 'Category A' through to a 'Category F' complaint. </p><p>- The most serious &quot;Category A&quot; complaints are those alleging assault or use of excessive force against a prisoner, or ill treatment, racial abuse, discrimination, intimidation, threats or any other conduct against a prisoner of a nature and gravity likely to bring discredit on the Irish Prison Service. I understand that Category A complaints are independently investigated by persons outside the Prison Service. </p><p>- Category B complaints are serious level complaints, which may include verbal abuse, inappropriate searches or any conduct against a prisoner of a nature likely to bring discredit on the Irish Prison Service. </p><p>- Category C may include complaints about visits, phone calls, reception issues.</p><p>- Category D complaints can be made against professionals which include medical personnel and solicitors. </p><p>- Category E can be made by visitors to the prison.</p><p>Further information on this system, including these categories, is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service at the following link: </p><p>In response to this question and further to the Deputy's previous parliamentary Question No. 318 for reply on 30 June 2020, the following table, furnished to me by the Irish Prison Service, sets out the number of category B, C, D and E complaints received in 2019 and to date in 2020.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Complaints received </th>       <th>Category B</th>       <th>Category C</th>       <th>Category D</th>       <th>Category E</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>149</td>       <td>678</td>       <td>137</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>976</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 (as of May 2020)</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>243</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>340</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The following table, furnished to me by the Irish Prison Service, sets out the further details requested by the Deputy, namely the details of the outcome of complaints.

The Border Management Unit (BMU) operate the scheme at Dublin Airport, which is the principal route through which people enter the State by air. While the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) manage the compliance for the other ports, the passenger locator forms are forwarded to the BMU in Dublin Airport, who also carry out the follow-up calls for those ports. </p><p>Any cases of non-compliance, identified by the BMU are referred directly to the GNIB for follow up. Section 31(a) of the Health Act 1947 (as amended) provides for powers of arrest for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Act and the regulations were brought forward by the Minister for Health. </p><p>The BMU established a system to follow-up on all arrivals at a proportionate rate of a minimum of 70%, after removal of the exempt categories of passengers. The cohort of passengers failing to answer initial phone calls are followed up with repeated further telephone contacts. The first calls are made two days after passengers have arrived into the State. For any passengers staying in the State for up to 14 days or more, a second call will be made on day 10 to ensure they are still residing at the address provided and self-isolating.</p><p>The BMU operates 24/7 on a split roster over two terminals in Dublin Airport, comprising of eight teams working a 12 hour shift.

I am also informed that in order to protect the ongoing availability of vehicles and in anticipation of the impact of public health restrictions on motor factory or fit-out workplaces, 94 additional vehicles were purchased by the Garda authorities in March 2020 at a cost of &euro;2.4 million and fit-out costs of &euro;600,000.  The allocation of these and all other vehicles in the fleet is entirely a matter for the Commissioner and his management team.  </p></reply>

There was consultation between senior officials in my Department and the Department of Health in relation to this legislation, and, having been drafted by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, the regulations were signed by the then Minister for Health, following consultation with my predecessor, Deputy Flanagan, as Minister for Justice and Equality, as well as the then Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  On foot of this the Garda Commissioner and his senior team have implemented a carefully graduated policing response, based on its strong tradition of policing by consent.  Garda members engage, explain and encourage members of the public to comply and, only as a last resort, make use of their enforcement powers under these regulations. A range of actions are being taken to ensure that the policing of these public health restrictions is carried out in an appropriate, proportionate and human rights compliant manner.</p>  <p>  Adherence to the return to work guidelines by establishments referred to by the Deputy is not a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but, rather, for the Health and Safety Authority. </p></reply>

This is in line with the National Drug and Alcohol Strategy which includes actions to strengthen the response to the illegal drugs market by developing systems to monitor changing drug trends in line with the EU Early Warning System (3.3.38a) and to complete the development of the HSE public alert system for adverse events due to drugs (3.3.38b).</p>  <p>  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the GNDOCB has communicated with the relevant bodies relating to its experience relating to the possession and use by particular persons of nitrous oxide. </p></reply>

From 1 October 2017, the duration of maternity leave and benefit has been extended in cases where a baby is born prematurely.

We are working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate. </p><p>All accommodation centres are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website . That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.  </p><p>The HSE confirmed on 20 May 2020 that an outbreak in the centre referred to was over and that the period of self-isolation for residents at the centre had ended.  All residents are now subject to the same restrictions as everyone else under the Government&rsquo;s roadmap.</p><p>With respect to access to services, my Department works closely with other Departments and agencies to link residents in with the necessary supports and services when an accommodation centre is being opened including with the Department of Education and Skills, DES, to plan for school provision for children resident in the centre. Asylum-seeking children living in accommodation centres are educated within the mainstream education system and can access free primary and post-primary education in the same way as other children in Ireland. A DES official is seconded to my Department to act as a liaison between both Departments and with schools, and the Tusla Education Support Service.</p><p>The Tusla Education Support Service is responsible for assisting with school enrolment and attendance.  Following the opening of a new accommodation centre, contact is made with local schools and a meeting is held with the centre manager, Tusla Education Support Service and the Department of Education and Skills to discuss and agree issues relating to the enrolment of the pupils. If there is a high concentration of children of school going age in the one centre, children are linked to a number of schools in the surrounding area.</p><p>When the numbers and age ranges of the children from the centre are identified, the Department of Education and Skills will ensure that:</p><p>-  Where the increase in the numbers of students entitles the school to an additional teaching allocation, this will be provided as soon as possible.</p><p>-  Where the enrolment of the children resident in the accommodation centre entitles the school to an additional teaching allocation for English as an Additional Language (EAL), this will be provided as soon as possible.</p><p>-  Where the increased enrolment requires an increase in the school&rsquo;s special educational needs teacher profile, they will receive, as soon as possible, 5 additional Special Education Teaching hours for every 25 additional pupils who are enrolled, or a proportion of five hours if less than 25.</p><p>-  Additional SNA provision for identified additional care needs.</p><p>A DES representative is available to advise schools on specific queries arising, including on the range of supports available to schools and on how to access supports. In order to ensure additional provision is made to schools without delay, schools who are enrolling children from accommodation centres will be invited by the Department of Education and Skills to apply for these supports in advance of those children beginning school.</p><p>Following the enrolment of pupils in local schools, if school transport is required, contact is made with Bus &Eacute;ireann, who operate the School Transport Scheme on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>All residents with children of school going-age are also advised of the availability of the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.</p><p>Adult residents are linked in with English language classes run by the local Education and Training Board.</p><p>Similarly with respect to health services , residents in the centre access local health services in the same manner as the local community. Access to GP services are provided through the medical card system.  The Department of Health and the HSE work closely with my Department to facilitate the delivery of health care services in the area. My Department covers travel costs for any centre resident who has to travel to access health services, inclusive of GP out of hours services.</p><p>In addition, international protection applicants access services and supports from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  These include:</p><p>-  a Personal Public Services Number (PPSN) for access to public services and financial supports; </p><p>-  a Daily Expenses Allowance (&euro;38.80 per week for an adult and &euro;29.80 per week for a child); </p><p>-  an Exceptional Needs Payment if required to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. This might include a payment for clothing, baby items or transport costs to necessary appointments.  The amount of payment depends on a means test and the type of assistance required; and</p><p>-  access to the Public Employment Service through the Intreo Centre network where Case Officers will assist, guide and support these clients in their job seeking efforts and/or educational needs. Applicants may have permission to access the labour market if they have not received a decision on their application within 9 months and if they have cooperated with the system. </p><p>A number of measures were introduced in the accommodation centre recently to make life more comfortable for the residents and in particular the children who are living there. </p><p>Families with children were provided with arts and crafts materials, toys, books and tablets, to use as they wished.  This was coordinated by the local Family Resource Centre with the cost of the tablets specifically covered by Tusla.  Additionally, I am informed that the service provider at the centre has provided 12 laptops for residents&rsquo; use, including the children of school going age.</p><p>I can also inform the Deputy that all international protection accommodation centres are contractually obliged to have Wi-Fi available to residents and TVs are provided in all bedrooms to enable children to access web-based educational resources and educational programmes.</p><p>Additional outdoor space has been opened up in the centre with some seating provided and, exercise equipment has been set up in the outdoor area for residents&rsquo; use. This outdoor equipment has been installed with the knowledge and support of HSE public health, and is being operated under their direction for safe use. The Department understands that the service provider also intends to install a playground in the coming weeks as an additional recreation facility for the children.</p><p>Virtual clinics between residents and my Department officials have been held in recent weeks to address any concerns the residents may have. A confidential Freephone telephone support service run by the Jesuit Refugee Service has also been introduced as a further support to residents in all centres.</p><p>While the centre is currently catered, in line with our overall policy objectives for all accommodation centres, the service provider plans to introduce independent living arrangements with cooking facilities for residents in the coming period.</p><p>My Department will continue to ensure that centre management manage the comfort and safety of all residents in the centre, and has no intention to close the centre at this time.</p></reply>

Under the Act, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational demands. This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles among the various Garda divisions.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters. I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that  as at 1 July 2020 there were 296 vehicles assigned to Roads Policing Duties nationwide. This figure is consistent with vehicles assigned to Roads Policing duty at 1 July 2019. </p><p>For the Deputy's information the attached spreadsheet sets out the vehicles assigned to Roads Policing duties for the dates requested by the Deputy. I am advised that within the DMR, there is a Roads Policing Division based in Dublin Castle (referred to as Traffic in the attached document) and there are also units within each of the six geographical Divisions within the DMR which cover road policing duties. </p><p>For clarity, it may be noted that these figures do not include the additional 210 vehicles which have been hired by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year, to provide additional capacity during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>I understand that the Commissioner established the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau to ensure a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State agencies. </p><p>In addition to a focus on the lifesaver offences of speeding, seatbelts, mobile phones and driving under the influence, Divisional Roads Policing Units work closely with other relevant Divisional Units to target known criminals and to disrupt their activities through strict enforcement of road traffic legislation. </p><p>Separately, the Deputy will be aware that significant capital investment is being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a total of &euro;46 million specifically for the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021. This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p><p>Of this investment, a total of &euro;9 million was made available for purchase and fit-out of additional Garda vehicles in 2020.  I am also informed that in order to protect the ongoing availability of vehicles and in anticipation of the impact of public health restrictions on motor factory or fit-out workplaces, 94 additional vehicles were purchased by the Garda authorities in March 2020 at a cost of &euro;2.4m and fit-out costs of &euro;600,000.  The allocation of these and all other vehicles in the fleet is entirely a matter for the Commissioner and his management team.  </p></reply>

The Bureau also returns funds to the State under Revenue legislation and through recovery of social welfare overpayments. In 2018, CAB returned in excess of &euro;5.6 million to the State including &euro;3.097 million under Revenue legislation and &euro;0.323 in social welfare overpayments in addition to the above figures. For 2019, CAB returned in excess of &euro;3.9 million to the State including &euro;2.026 million under Revenue legislation and &euro;0.324 in social welfare overpayments in addition to the above figures. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) is a multi-agency statutory body established under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996.  The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated. </p><p>The Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 - 2016 provide the legal framework underpinning the Bureau's powers to take all necessary actions, including the making of applications to the High Court, in relation to the seizing and securing of assets with a view to their disposal in due course in accordance with the provisions of that legislation. </p></reply>

The penalty on conviction is a fine of up to &euro;1,500 for a first offence and up to &euro;2,000 for a second or subsequent offence.   </p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, makes provision for offences relating to the sale and delivery of alcohol products to persons under the age of 18 years. It is an offence under section 31(2) for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol products to any person for consumption off his or her licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission. The penalty on conviction for this offence is a fine of up to &euro;1,270 for a first offence and up to &euro;1,904 for a second or subsequent offence. In addition, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides for the mandatory temporary closure of licensed premises in cases where a licensee is convicted of an offence under section 31 of the 1988 Act (up to 7 days for a first offence, or at least 7 and not more than 30 days for a second or subsequent offence).</p>  <p>  With technology that facilitates video calls being commonplace in the conduct of business in a broad spectrum of contexts such as doctor&rsquo;s surgeries, there do not appear to be any practical impediments to vendors verifying the age of purchasers who purchase alcohol from their homes.  The purchase must be completed from their home in advance of delivery.</p>  <p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 Report.  It took the view that sales of alcohol products which have been ordered by telephone or text messaging and which are paid for on delivery do not comply with licensing law requirements and are, therefore, illegal. The Group recommended that the Garda&iacute; target &ldquo;dial-a-can&rdquo; and similar delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees. Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the Licensing Acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, there is substantial existing legislation to regulate the delivery of alcohol services in Ireland and, as matters currently stand, I do not propose to introduce new legislation in this area.  However, I do appreciate that, with the Covid-19 outbreak, habits of consumers have been affected and the share of purchases online has increased substantially. These changes may be temporary or they may be the beginning of longer term trends. It is perhaps too early to tell what impacts these changes may have and whether increased online sales and delivery of alcohol will, on balance, provide increased convenience and choice to consumers and new revenue streams for small rural pubs or have negative impacts on society that require further regulation.  It is in that context that I very much welcome the work being carried out by groups like ICAAN in assisting in the gathering of data in relation to the potential impacts of changes in our society that can help inform an evidence based approach to policy development on these matters.    </p></reply>

The fact that a person may have had an application refused does not preclude or disqualify them from submitting a fresh application in the future. Indeed, the letter advising an applicant of a negative decision also informs them that they may re-apply for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation at any time. The letter advises that, when considering making such a re-application, they should give due regard to the reasons for the refusal which were contained in the submission attached to the refusal letter and that any further application will be considered taking into account all statutory and administrative conditions applicable at the time of application.</p>  <p>  Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may grant a certificate of naturalisation if, among other things, that the applicant has been resident in the State for a period of one year immediately prior to the date of application and four years in the eight year period before that. For the purpose of calculating this residency, no period may be taken into account where a non-national;</p>  <p>-  was required to have the permission of the Minister to remain in the State but did not have that permission; or</p>  <p>-  had permission to remain for the purpose of study (whether or not such study necessitated the employment of the non-national during the whole or part of the period of study); or</p>  <p>-  had permission to remain for the purpose of seeking to be recognised as a refugee (within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996) where such application was either unsuccessful or withdrawn.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and I know the Deputy will appreciate that it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

I have previously set out detail on the measures adopted to address the risk presented by Covid-19 in a prison environment, guided by the advice of NPHET and consistent with the prison-specific guidance of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Measures adopted included:</p><p>-- reduction of prisoner numbers through use of temporary release of low-risk prisoners, following case-by-case assessment;</p><p>-- introduction of a basic health check, including taking of temperatures for all persons,  including staff, entering prisons from 29 March;</p><p>-- suspension of physical family visits, replaced by video visits;</p><p>-- quarantining for 14 days of all newly committed prisoners; isolation of suspected case or prisoners with symptoms; and &ldquo;cocooning&rdquo; of vulnerable prisoners;</p><p>-- comprehensive training for IPS staff and the provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) across the prison estate; and</p><p>-- establishment of a robust contract tracing model which has been acknowledged by the WHO as best practice.</p><p>I am pleased to say that to date there has been no prisoner case of Covid-19 in Irish prisons. Nevertheless the risk continues and must be managed. </p><p>In relation to the categories of prisoners referred to by the Deputy, I can say the following.</p><p>First, in relation to cocooning: in line with the position at the time in the wider community, the Prison Service operated a regime whereby all prisoners aged 70 years or more and prisoners deemed medically vulnerable due to specific serious underlying medical conditions were cocooned in the prisons in which they were detained.  These cocooning prisoners were removed from free association, but could associate with one another in dedicated areas.  I am informed that the practice of cocooning has now ceased in prisons, in line with the general easing of relevant public health restrictions in the community. However prisoners formerly cocooning were offered the option of a restricted regime at their own request.</p><p>In relation to isolation, I am advised that any prisoner who informs staff that they are experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 is immediately assessed by prison healthcare staff, who arrange for the prisoner to be isolated and tested.  I am further informed that any prisoner who has had contact with another person who has been tested for Covid-19 and is awaiting results is also isolated from the prison population, while they are tested and awaiting the results of said test.</p><p>In addition, all prisoners newly committed to prison are placed in quarantine for 14 days before being transferred into general population. This measure is in place to reduce the risk that a new committal who might be incubating the virus could spread Covid-19 into the general prison population. </p><p>I am informed by the Prison Service that it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the out-of-cell hours for each of these groups of prisoners, as they vary on a daily basis and for a variety of reasons including for example the number of prisoners involved, the number of staff available, and differences in physical layout of each prison.</p><p>However I am advised that any prisoners who were cocooning as well as those in quarantine continue to have access to a wide range of services and facilities within the prison. These facilities include psychological support, phone calls, television, tuck shop and chaplaincy services.  I understand that particular efforts have also been made to ensure that prisoners could communicate with their families, through increased provision of telephone services and video visits.

The request for a preliminary ruling was made in relation to the interpretation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (the Brussels IIA Regulation). The ECJ judgment confirms that the Brussels IIA Regulation applies to cases concerning rights of access to a child by a wide family circle including the child&rsquo;s grandparents and that, according to Article 8 of that Regulation, jurisdiction to examine such an application lies with the courts of the Member State in which the child was habitually resident at the time when the court was seized. </p>  <p>  The Brussels IIA Regulation has direct effect in Irish law, with the European Communities (Judgments in Matrimonial Matters and Matters of Parental Responsibility) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 112 of 2005) making necessary provision for the good administration of the Regulation.  The Irish courts will take consideration of the Regulation in cases where there is any dispute as to which Member State has jurisdiction to hear an application to which the Regulation applies.  </p>  <p>  The ECJ judgment has no effect on Irish legislation. The Deputy may wish to note that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is a child&ndash;centred Act which implemented reforms in family law to recognise the crucial role of parents and other relatives, including grandparents, in a child's life. </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act extensively amended the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in relation to guardianship, custody and access. A grandparent or other relative may apply to court for custody of a child where he or she is an adult who has undertaken the child&rsquo;s day to day care for more than 12 months and the child has no parent or guardian willing or able to act as guardian. The 2015 Act has also made it easier for relatives of a child, such as grandparents, to apply to court under section 11B of the 1964 Act to have access to children.   </p>  <p>  Section 25 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.   </p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court to take into account in any proceedings where access to a child is in question.  It is a matter for the courts, when making decisions on access, to determine the best interests of the child and to decide whether or not to make an order regarding access to the child.</p></reply>

It had already completed its passage through the Seanad by October 2019 and had been scheduled for Committee stage in the D&aacute;il when the election was called for February.  Restoration of this Bill has been sought and further progress will then be dependent on Oireachtas scheduling. </p>  <p>  Second, in relation to of Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA relating to the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty, I can confirm that transposition is being progressed with drafting of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Custodial Sentences) Bill.   </p>  <p>  The Government approved the General Scheme and drafting of this Bill recently, on 12 June.

Further, the allocation of Garda resources is made in light of identified operational demand. This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. </p>  <p>  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy has clarified that his question relates to DMR North. I can confirm that as at the 31st May 2020, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 801 Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR North. This compares to a figure of 753 on 31st December 2019. Of this total, there were 11 Community Garda&iacute; assigned to DMR North as of 31st May, compared to 39 on 31st December.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, as of 16th March 2020, a Contingency Roster was introduced into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na owing to the COVID-19 Pandemic. I am informed by the Garda authorities that in order to maximise the availability of resources, members attached to Community Policing were allocated to the Core Roster or the Supplementary Units. This provision will continue until September 2020. </p>  <p>  I am further informed however that the expected abstraction rate by COVID-19 did not occur within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and therefore the organisation maintained its strength throughout. I am advised that this meant that, in essence, the community Garda&iacute; could still attend to their community functions although the groups with whom they generally engage are not in a position to meet.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is currently implementing the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland through the four year implementation plan A Policing Service for the Future. In its report, published in September 2018, the Commission outlined a vision and roadmap for strengthening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the broader national framework for policing, security and community safety. The report followed extensive consultations with communities and a wide range of stakeholders over fifteen months. </p>  <p>  A key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future is the rollout of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s new Operating Model. The Garda Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing an increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting victims of crime. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in each Division, there will be a dedicated Superintendent leading a community engagement team. I am confident that this reorganisation will further strengthen community policing and engagement, and provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each Division nationwide.</p>  <p>  In a broader sense, the Deputy might also wish to note that implementation of A Policing Service for the Future will see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 repealed and replaced by a Policing and Community Safety Act. My Department is progressing work on the preparation of a Policing and Community Safety Bill as a matter of priority. </p>  <p>  In addition to setting out a new governance and oversight framework for policing, it will redefine the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable, place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety and refine local structures supporting local accountability for policing.  In that context, my Department is currently in the process of finalising the most appropriate model to achieve this. All existing structures and approaches to community safety have been considered as part of this work and in line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing that community policing and community engagement should be at the heart of new structures and policing arrangements.</p>  <p>  As I have indicated to the Deputy, work is well advanced on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Bill.  Once it is finalised, I intend to bring it before the Government for approval and publication in the normal manner.</p></reply>

The main function of the Inspector of Prisons is to carry out regular inspections of prisons and places of detention in Ireland. The Inspector also investigates deaths of prisoners in custody and has oversight of the prisoner complaints procedure in the Irish Prison Service.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to see an increase in the budget for the Office of the Inspector of Prisons of &euro;0.7m in Budget 2020, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.2 million.  This total allocation represented an increase of over 140% compared to the Office's budget in 2019. </p>  <p>  On the basis of the current budget, a 50% increase would cost &euro;600,000 and bring the total budget to &euro;1.8 million.

A proposal, which involves relocating the organisation to a modern purpose-built facility at the State and Agricultural Laboratory complex at Backweston, Co. Kildare, was included in the Public Capital Programme since 2015 and more recently in the National Development Plan. Cabinet gave approval to my predecessor's proposal to proceed with the project on 3rd March 2020.</p>  <p>  The main contractor took full possession of the site on 19 March 2020. Work was interrupted by Covid-19 but has since resumed and is proceeding in accordance with the contract. The works over the last number of weeks have consisted primarily of site preparation works, establishment of contractor facilities, foundation works, drainage and preparatory work for hard landscaped areas. </p>  <p>  At a cost of &euro;99,518,304 (inclusive of VAT), this new laboratory will provide FSI with a functional, purpose-built facility, achieving best practice standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage. The objective is for a world class facility that meets all relevant standards for FSI's important work. The project represents a significant and important investment in our criminal justice system and is a practical demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to investing in the fight against crime. </p>  <p>  Projections at this time are for a two year build with completion by July 2022.</p></reply>

It aims to reform family law in a way that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, the reality of contemporary family life in Ireland.  It attempts to better reflect this reality by meeting the needs of children living in diverse family types.  Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act of 2015 contain provisions relating to the regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures carried out in the State.  This covers situations where the child born as a result of that procedure is born in the State and where the intending mother carries the pregnancy and gives birth to the child.  The recent commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (as amended) on 4 May 2020 will, for the first time, provide a legal framework for registering the births of children who are born as a result of assisted human reproduction (AHR) involving donated eggs or sperm or embryos.  </p>  <p>  People can also acquire rights in respect of their children through guardianship or step-adoption.  Under section 6C of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as amended) &ndash; which was inserted by section 49 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 &ndash; a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant (who has co-habited with the other parent for over three years), can apply for guardianship provided they have shared parenting responsibility for the child for over two years.  The applicant applies to the District Court for guardianship.  Issues relating to guardianship rights generally are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.</p>  <p>  In addition, it may be possible for the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a child&rsquo;s legal parent to obtain full parental rights and responsibilities in respect of the child through step-parent adoption.  Issues relating to adoption are the responsibility of the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration. </p>  <p>  In relation to children born through surrogacy, the Deputy may be aware that the Government approved the drafting of a bill on AHR and associated areas of research which encompasses the regulation of a range of practices for the first time, including altruistic domestic surrogacy.  The General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.  These provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority.  The General Scheme also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s).  Drafting of the Bill is ongoing in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p><p>In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p><p>The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p><p>Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p><p>The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: <i>www.hse.ie/newdirections</i>. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link. </p><p>Regarding services more widely, including children's services, the HSE and its partner service providers are endeavouring to maintain essential support services during this unprecedented public health emergency. HSE Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) are continuing to proactively engage with disability service providers to ensure that appropriate contingency arrangements are made so that the necessary supports are put in place for persons with disabilities and their families. In the absence of regular access to some service and supports, CHOs and service providers tried to maintain services that can be delivered safely; providing outreach and telecare solutions, using technology where possible; and using creative and innovative models of care to support service users, both adults and children. </p><p>The HSE is very aware of the impact of the pandemic on people with disabilities, their families and carers and have over the past few weeks developed a number of working groups to plan and develop guidance on how we will be able to deliver supports, albeit in a new way and under the Public Health guidance. </p><p>In this regard and whilst accepting that very significant levels of vital therapies have been temporarily curtailed, it is important to emphasise that the HSE is now in the process of detailed planning in order to recover these services in line with the Governments&rsquo; Roadmap. It is important to note that this must be supported by way of assurance and oversight from the HSE&rsquo;s Chief Clinical Officer along with the National Public Health Emergency Team, so that we can do so in a safe manner. This means that therapies, whilst being delivered in new ways, will gradually be re-introduced to children with disabilities. </p><p>With regard to specific services, service providers can provide this information directly. As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Organisations receiving funding from the HSE should raise any concerns in relation to financial issues that may have implications for continuity of service provision with the relevant Community Health Care Organisation (CHO) responsible for the service arrangements. </p>  <p>  A critical focus at this time is the assurance of value for money in delivering on the required patient services and population health needs to effectively manage COVID-19 infection within the Irish context.  Accordingly, the financial implications of measures taken to mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak are matters which the Department of Health will continue to keep under review in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as the situation evolves.</p>  <p>  Organisations providing health and social care services were eligible to apply for the Community and Voluntary Sector &euro;35m Stability Fund, which is now closed to applications.  This scheme is intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups delivering front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fundraising or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19. The approval of funding under Tranche One of the Scheme was announced on 26 June. Further tranches will be announced over the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The Government has exempted places of worship from the regulations restricting numbers on mass gatherings. The exemption applies to places of worship only and not to any gatherings that may take place after the religious ceremony such as wedding receptions. </p><p>Detailed Covid-19 Guidance has been developed for religious services. The Cabinet Committee reviewed the guidance, which state that an assessment should be carried out for each premises to determine how many can attend within the requirements of social distancing. </p><p>The Cabinet Committee decided that where the size of the premises allows for a capacity of greater than 50 this may be permitted only where:</p><p>-Social distancing guidelines are adhered to</p><p>- The premises can be subdivided into distinct sections (cordoned or marked appropriately) of not more than 50 persons in each section</p><p>- There is a minimum of 4m between sections</p><p>- Each section has its own entrance/exit route</p><p>- There are separate arrangements for elements of the service involving close contact, e.g. the distribution of Holy Communion</p><p>- Strictly no movement of people between sections before, during or after the service</p><p>- The premises is well-ventilated.</p><p>Account must also be taken regarding the risk of congregation by people outside before and after any services, having regard to outdoor overall limits on mass gatherings and arrangements for staggered exiting after ceremonies</p><p>The use of face coverings is strongly recommended for such indoor settings.</p></reply>

Reporting to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, HIQA&rsquo;s role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.</p>  <p>  HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out. HIQA has responsibility for setting standards for healthcare services, and monitoring compliance with those standards. It also regulates facilities providing care for the elderly and those with disabilities, and has a role with regard to inspecting some of the social care services which are accessed by children to determine if they are meeting the relevant National Standards.  </p>  <p>  Following a statutory consultation process and Ministerial approval, HIQA published specific national standards for community health and social care services in Ireland (including nursing and residential homes), which cover infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship. HIQA has also developed standards for other services, including national standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections in acute healthcare services. HIQA has in turn conducted a thematic inspection programme against these standards since 2012.</p>  <p>  HIQA has advised the Department all of its social care inspectors (i.e. for older persons&rsquo; and disability services) have a professional health and or social care qualification and experience relevant to the role. All of its 59 social care inspectors have had full training as a regulator, and are confident in assessing the quality of care in a designated centre which includes monitoring compliance with national standards and regulations related to infection prevention and control. </p>  <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s further advises that its 15 healthcare inspectors also have professional healthcare qualifications and training in monitoring compliance with national standards related to infection prevention and control.</p>  <p>  In the context of this public health emergency, HIQA&rsquo;s advises that its full cohort of inspectors  have had enhanced training in assessing how well registered providers have planned for, can detect, respond to and manage an outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, training has been delivered to inspectors of social services on the public health measures required to undertake inspections.</p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p><p>HIQA monitors compliance with nationally-mandated standards and regulations to ensure that older people are receiving safe, high-quality and person-centred care. HIQA takes a risk-based approach to inspection and when information is received to suggest that there is a risk to the wellbeing of residents, HIQA uses this information to decide which regulations will be inspected against. Registered providers are required to be compliant with regulation 27 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013  on infection control. </p><p>HIQA inspections can take place over one or two days, with the duration influenced by factors such as the:</p><p>-COVID-19 status of the centre</p><p>- reason for the inspection</p><p>- number of inspectors on inspection</p><p>- size of the centre</p><p>- findings during the course of the inspection. </p><p>Inspections progress rapidly in centres where residents are well cared for, the findings are good, and the provider is organised and the required documentation is readily available for review.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the matter and provide you with a direct response.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition and the HSE has advised GPs accordingly.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that, nonetheless, some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. The GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in from this year will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients' condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  However, it remains a matter of concern to me that a GMS and GP visit card patient might be charged for blood tests which are clinically necessary and I have asked my officials to discuss with the HSE what further solutions to this issue may be possible.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan.</p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand.   </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.   </p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The assessment should consider the risk factors for getting COVID-19, that is Distance, Activity, Time and Environment, and include controls such as managed entry, improved hygiene facilities, and regular cleaning to limit these.

This saw the funding of the NTPF increase by &euro;25million to &euro;100million. The year-on-year increases to the National Treatment Purchase Fund since Budget 2017 reflect the Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment.</p>  <p>  It was the expectation of the Department that the majority (&euro;69million) of the NTPF funding allocation for 2020 would be expended broadly in line with 2019 levels of activity vis-&agrave;-vis IPDC, OPD and GI Endoscopy initiatives.  In addition, in 2020, the NTPF would further expand its list of targeted inpatient and day case procedures to support further significant reductions in wait times, with a particular focus on improving access to hospital outpatient services. This would include arranging full care for patients on the outpatient waiting lists, to include the surgery or treatment where required.  </p>  <p>  A key focus in 2020 was the development of sustainable solutions to tackle waiting lists, in line with the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare. In this regard, it was the intention that the additional &euro;25million of the NTPF Budget allocation for 2020 would be used to examine new and innovative solutions. </p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan.  </p>  <p>  At the end of March, the NTPF advised the Department that in line with the National Action Plan on COVID-19, it was temporarily ceasing the commissioning of both Inpatient / Day case procedures (including GI scopes) and Outpatient appointments. This temporary cessation applied to both insourced and outsourced commissioning.</p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p>  <p>  With the increase in elective care activity, the NTPF's Commissioning Team is now working with HSE Hospital Groups and Private Hospitals to establish available capacity for insourcing and outsourcing initiatives from July onwards. Due to the ongoing emergency, the available capacity of the health system, both private and public, is currently being reviewed and it is not yet possible to estimate how much activity will be available for procurement. The Department and the NTPF will engage with each other in order to assess the potential for the NTPF to use its full allocation to purchase additional hospital treatments.  In doing so, the NTPF will consider the entire health system, outside of the traditional NTPF areas, including diagnostics and beds.</p></reply>

In light of these unprecedented challenges, the HSE, at the outset, had to reassess its operation of Home Support Services nationally, to ensure that the assessed needs of those clients with the highest priority were and still are being met. The HSE, working with its approved home support service providers are endeavouring to maintain essential support services during this unprecedented public health emergency.  In this context, the HSE has set out a prioritisation process for home support, which looks at delivering a service based on priority need across 4 priority categories.</p>  <p>  As a result of that review of prioritisation, a number of clients with lower priority needs had their home support service temporarily ceased or reduced with the support of family members and/or alternative forms of volunteer provided local supports. In these cases, each client was contacted to advise of the assessment and decision, alternative support available and assistance given to ensure that essential requirements continue to be provided. The HSE continues to review both those clients whose home support service may have been temporarily suspended and those clients of higher priority currently in receipt of home support services.</p>  <p>  The HSE is in the process of restoring services, where capacity exists. In order to maximise the capacity available, consideration has to be given to balancing delivery of service against suspended clients, clients assessed and waiting on commencement of home support services and the continued requirement to meet the needs of higher priority clients currently in receipt of services.</p>  <p>  The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2021 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE, including home support will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

It provides for a 10% increase in the rural GP allowance, an increase in the allowance paid to dispensing GPs, and a targeted fund of &euro;2 million to support practices in deprived urban areas. Maternity and paternity leave arrangements have been improved, in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments. A wide-ranging set of modernisation measures have also been agreed in the areas such as eHealth and medicines management. In return for cooperation with these service developments and reforms, investment in general practice will increase by approximately 40% (or &euro;210 million) over four years.  At the end of 2019 95% GMS GPs (2,374) had accepted the terms of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Agreement also includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  The outcome of this review will inform future contractual changes. Preparatory work for the review is beginning this year.</p></reply>

CervicalCheck began sending invites and reminders to participants in its cervical screening programme on the 06 of July, Diabetic RetinaScreen will also resume screening in July.  BreastCheck and BowelScreen will resume screening in September/October.</p></reply>

The project has been supported by the Radiology Clinical Care Programme and has involved key stakeholders across the system including the National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) Team, Hospital Groups, and the support of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) for data collection and data management expertise.</p>  <p>  At present, the pilot project collects data relating to CT, MRI and Ultrasound.  In Q1 2020, there were a total of 190,373 patients reported on the waiting list from all sites, this represents all outpatients waiting, urgent, semi urgent, routine and planned/surveillance (where diagnostic access is planned at particular time intervals).  </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently rolling out a diagnostics plan that envisages a range of diagnostic/imaging services being provided across all Community Healthcare Organisations with the support of hospitals and private providers, with a particular focus on improving GP access to ultrasound.  The Deputy may wish to note that in 2019, there were 67,000 ultrasound and 79,500 x-rays delivered via GP access to radiology services. </p>  <p>  In terms of medium-term planning for additional diagnostic capacity, the National Development Plan states that, new dedicated ambulatory elective only hospital facilities will be introduced in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  As per the Development plan, these facilities will provide high volume, low complexity procedures on a day and outpatient basis, together with a range of ambulatory diagnostic services. </p>  <p>  As part of the wider Sl&aacute;intecare implementation, the Elective Hospitals Oversight Group, established by the Department of Health, is currently developing a high-level facilities spatial brief and order of magnitude costs which details the elective clustering of appropriate activities for each of the three facilities in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  This will also include an output and facility specification, based on efficient and effective service delivery, which will include diagnostic procedures.

This represents an increase of &euro;138.7m or 7.2% on the 2019 budget.   </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has agreed to allocate substantial additional funding to the Health Vote to meet the costs associated with the implementation of the measures outlined in the National Action Plan in response to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The HSE, through the Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) is actively engaging with any Section 38 and Section 39 disability service providers who are experiencing financial challenges, including access to cash acceleration, where appropriate, to maintain continuity of service provision during the pandemic.  Organisations receiving funding from the HSE should raise any concerns in relation to financial issues that may have implications for continuity of service provision with the relevant Community Health Care Organisation (CHO) responsible for the service arrangements. </p>  <p>  The HSE has agreed a structured approach to addressing the financial challenges of Section 39 service providers due to COVID-19.  The objective of the programme is to provide a structured governance process and modus operandi through which Section 39 partners experiencing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency can engage through the HSE to ensure, where appropriate, continuity of essential services provided by these agencies.  The HSE has also developed a methodology to provide a pro forma approach to support decision making in respect of Section 39 Organisations that have made submissions to the HSE for both financial and non-financial supports during the COVID-19 pandemic.    </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised my Department that it has given Section 38 and Section 39 providers of disability services and supports assurance that budget allocations confirmed to each provider via the relevant CHO, will remain in place to year end, subject to co-operation with the HSE and compliance with the relevant Service Arrangements.</p>  <p>  Other supports provided by CHOs to Section 38 and Section 39 organisations providing disability specialist services between March and May 2020 include PPE; Infection Prevention and Control support, advice and training; Public Health advice/support with regard to suspected/positive cases; Isolation facilities allied to testing, funding for emergency residential placements and logistics in the form of transport and accommodation.  In addition, COVID response teams were put in place to assist and support residential service providers during the pandemic.  These teams will now oversee and support the reshaping of disability services as a result of COVID 19. </p>  <p>  A critical focus at this time is the assurance of value for money in delivering on the required patient services and population health needs to effectively manage COVID-19 infection within the Irish context.  Accordingly, the financial implications of measures taken to mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak are matters which the Department of Health will continue to keep under review in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as the situation evolves.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the COVID-19 Stability Fund for Community and Voluntary, Charity and Social Enterprises which is administered by Pobal, on behalf of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Organisations providing disability specialist services were eligible to apply to the Fund, which is now closed for applications.  This scheme is intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups delivering front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fundraised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19.  The approval of funding under Tranche One of the Scheme was announced on 26 June.  Further tranches will be announced over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

However, the reliability of serological tests remains an issue as does the interpretation of what immunity means and how long such immunity might last.  These remain active research questions.</p>  <p>  The ECDC has reported that over 60 rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have been CE marked to date, and many more continue to be placed on the market.  Prior to the introduction of new serological assays [antibody tests] clinical validation studies are required to confirm that test performance can be replicated in the context in which the test is intended to be used.</p>  <p>  Following a request from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) are now undertaking a national population sero-prevalence study to measure exposure to COVID-19 infection in the population using an antibody blood test.  This work is being carried out jointly by HPSC and the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL), in collaboration with the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  On Monday 15th June, the HSE issued letters to more than 5,000 people inviting them to participate in the Study to Investigate COVID-19 Infection in People Living in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Participants in the study are representative of the wider population.  Dublin and Sligo have been selected as sample locations as they represent areas of the country with higher and lower known levels of infection respectively.  Using a representative sample of participants in both locations, it will be possible to provide an overall national estimate of infection in the Irish population. </p>  <p>  Serological tests measure the antibody response in an individual.  Antibodies to COVID-19 are produced over several weeks after infection with the virus.  The presence of antibodies indicates that a person was infected with the COVID-19 virus, irrespective of whether the individual had severe or mild disease or even asymptomatic infection.  The assessment of population immunity can help determine the level of antibodies required to achieve herd immunity, identify groups of susceptible individuals and evaluate the persistence and duration of protective antibodies.</p>  <p>  The study will add to our knowledge about how long antibodies last and what protection they may provide against new infection of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  According to the HSE, initial results are expected in late August and will enable the HPSC to estimate the level or prevalence of infection of COVID-19 in the population across different age groups.</p>  <p>  Any decisions with regard to additional antibody testing will take into consideration the outcome of this study and any other relevant studies.</p></reply>

This necessitates flexibility in the composition of these national teams in order that they can appropriately respond to major public health emergencies. </p><p>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the NPHET for COVID-19 is accountable to me as Minister for Health and is made up of senior public officials of the Department of Health and a number of relevant State Agencies, in addition to highly qualified subject matter experts from disciplines such as virology, infectious diseases, intensive care etc. who are among the leading practitioners in their fields in this country.</p><p>The NPHET can add to its membership on the basis of the additional expertise or support it identifies as being required so as to ensure that it is in the best possible position to provide advice and recommendations for consideration by the Minister for Health and the Government.  These are the criteria on which the NPHET identifies the requirement for particular expertise.  This flexibility in approach to selection is necessary for a group such as this in the context of an international public health crisis of the kind we are currently experiencing due to the pandemic, and gives effect to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations to the WHO.</p><p>Consideration is currently being given to the national response to the emergence of Covid-19 that has been mounted to date with a view to ensuring that as a country we are as well prepared as possible for the coming period and any potential resurgence in the virus, and that will of course include ensuring that the NPHET continues to be in a position to offer evidence based advice and recommendations to me and the Government as the situation evolves.  </p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question in relation to the publication of recommendations and submissions, a wide range of documentation related to NPHET has been published to date and it is intended to continue this process to ensure transparency.  Letters, agendas, and minutes arising from the NPHET are available on the Department of Health website.  I might add that papers discussed at the NPHET meetings from 30 January 2020 to 25 February 2020 inclusive are available to view on the DOH website at <i></i>.  </p><p>Work is continuing to place the papers from further NPHET meetings on the website as quickly as possible, with additional papers to be published regularly going forward.</p></reply>

They have advised the Department that as of 3rd June, our recovery rate in healthcare workers is 93%.  This is a higher recovery rate than in the general population, because relatively few healthcare workers have been hospitalised and very few admitted to ICU.  </p><p>It is worth noting that Ireland, in contrast with many other countries, maintains a very wide definition of a healthcare worker for surveillance purposes and hence international comparisons should be interpreted with caution.  In Ireland, a healthcare worker is anyone who works in any area of healthcare across community and hospital settings.  It includes, for example, administrative staff, catering, maintenance, IT etc whereas in many other countries it is a considerably narrower definition of frontline workers or even just doctors and nurses.  Our very broad definition of healthcare worker along with extensive testing contribute to our proportion of all COVID-19 infections that have been in healthcare workers.</p><p>There have been several studies worldwide of healthcare worker COVID-19 infection rates which have shown an infection rate of 5 to 10% of HCWs, whereas in Ireland this rate is close to 3-4% of HCWs based on estimates from the CSO Labour Force Survey of between 225,000 and 250,000 people working in Ireland who would identify as healthcare workers or as working in a healthcare setting.</p><p>In an article published by Hunter et al in the Lancet, on 2nd of May 2020 referred to a study in Newcastle (UK) on the 10th and 11th of March, where a random sample of hospital healthcare workers were tested and 5% were COVID-19 positive.  This random sample testing was repeated on the 30th and 31st of March and 20% of healthcare workers were COVID-19 positive.</p><p>In a Dutch study (Eurosurveillance, Reuskin et al,26/03/2020), 400 healthcare were tested between the 27th of February and the 6th of March 2020 and 2.5% were positive for COVID-19.  Between the 6th and the 8th of March 2020, 1,100 HCWs were tested and 4.1% were COVID-19 positive. </p><p>As such, it would not appear that the rates of infection among Irish healthcare workers are not out of line with the experiences of comparator countries.  However, I have asked my officials to examine this issue further so as to ensure that we are doing everything possible in relation to this crucial aspect of the response to Covid-19.</p></reply>

This report included the findings from external experts on international pay comparisons for each cohort, including nursing.  The report concluded that Ireland is competitive relative to other markets in terms of security benefits such as pension, maternity leave, sick leave and long-term disability benefits, though it also found that there was a case for providing additional incentives for qualified nursing and midwifery staff to remain in the public health service.</p>  <p>  The report recommended increases to certain fixed allowances and an extension of those allowances to other working areas for nurses and midwives.  It also recommended accelerated career progression for Staff Nurses, reducing the length of service requirement for Staff Nurses wishing to progress to Senior Staff Nurses.  These measures were accepted by Government as part of the overall 2019 Nursing Agreement.  That agreement included additional measures that improved pay and allowances for certain nursing grades, including the creation of an Enhanced Nurse Practice scale as well as further extending the application of the location allowance to those nurses working in medical and surgical areas.  In addition, it also provided for the setting up of an Expert Review Body on Nursing and Midwifery and this is due to commence its activity on 30 July 2020.  I look forward to reviewing the report of the Expert Review Body in due course.</p>  <p>  While noting the PSPC's findings on international comparisons, the remuneration measures arising from the Nursing Agreement should further assist in making a career in Nursing in Ireland more attractive.</p></reply>

As the disease has progressed, a range of enhanced measures for nursing homes recommended by NPHET on 31st March and 3rd April are being implemented.  The enhanced measures build on actions already adopted for nursing homes, including general and specific infection prevention measures, specific public health and clinical nursing home guidance published March 17th and subsequently updated, social distancing measures, visitor restrictions and cocooning.  A number of webinars were delivered in March and April to provide support and advice to nursing homes including in relation to infection prevention and control.</p>  <p>  While nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents the HSE is providing staffing, PPE, Oxygen, training and other supports to nursing homes where needed.  The HSE has an established process in place for access to PPE and this is the appropriate avenue for nursing homes to engage as required.  It has also established 23 HSE COVID Response Teams across the CHOs, to provide support and expert guidance to all long-term care residential settings.  These teams comprise of a Director of Nursing as well as clinical and public health expertise and links to acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  Together with this unprecedented support to the nursing home sector a COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme has been established to support nursing home providers by contributing towards additional COVID-19 costs such as staffing, enhanced cleaning and infection prevention and control.  The original scheme was due to end on June 30, after 3 months, however the scheme has now been extended for a further 3 months until the end of September.  This extension will give further support and certainty to this sector.</p>  <p>  Furthermore on foot of a National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendation, on 23 May a COVID-19 Expert Panel on Nursing Homes was established, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Panel is to examine the national and international responses to the COVID-19 crisis, and to examine the emerging best practice.  Its main objective is to provide immediate real-time learnings and recommendations in light of the expected ongoing impact of COVID-19 over the next 12-18 months.  COVID-19 is a new disease, which can present atypically in the frail elderly, and new evidence and best practice in its management are constantly emerging.  I expect the Expert Panel to submit their final report to me later this month.</p></reply>

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts.  The Review Group on Transport Supports for People with a Disability reported to Government in 2013 and the Report informed the deliberative process for proposals for a new Scheme. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there were 3,831 people in receipt of the interim payments at July 2019. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.   </p>  <p>  At the whole of Government level, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group.  </p>  <p>  Under the Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.   </p>  <p>  Recent developments which will impact on policy options regarding the provision of transport supports for people with a disability include the following: </p>  <p>  The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in providing accessible public transport nationally and that Department's public consultation launched on 14 November last, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;   </p>  <p>  The Cost of Disability Study currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs, and;</p>  <p>  The Working Group established by the Department of Justice and Equality under Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy which states that:- 'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision.  This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources."</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work.  This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way.  This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened.  The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge.  The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system.  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Each year the Health Service Executive sets out in its National Service Plan the allocation of the funding received from government for the delivery of health services for the year. </p><p>The amount allocated each year follows an extensive process of engagement between my Department and the Department of Expenditure and Reform, which considered both the funding requirements and the fiscal position.  These types of engagements are a normal part of the Budgetary process and happen with Departments across Government.  All Departments put forward spending proposals but are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il. </p><p>The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge for both the Irish and international Governments.  Despite welcome increases annually, the need for effective financial management remains crucial as the health service deals with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs associated with these service pressures will increasingly need to be managed not solely through annual increased Exchequer allocations but also through improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base. </p><p>Funding is provided to the HSE for Health services in accordance with the letter of determination which sets out the approved level of overall HSE expenditure for the year in question. </p><p>From the table below you can see the majority of the funding for the period 2017 to 2020 has been allocated to pay cost pressures and maintaining existing levels of service, taking account of demographic changes.  These allocations are balanced with new developments seeking to continuously improve the Irish health system and the growing costs arising from pensions and the state claims agency. </p><p>2017 saw the commencement of the unwinding of the savings delivered under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009; this combined with other national pay agreements since 2016 has had a significant impact on the funding required to address pay cost pressures annually. </p><p>Significant funding is also allocated towards maintaining existing levels of service. <table>    <tr>       <th>Description</th>       <th>Increase in 2016</th>       <th>Increase in 2017</th>       <th>Increase in 2018</th>       <th>Increase in 2019</th>       <th>Increase in 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>HSE</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pay Cost Pressures</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>174</td>       <td>278</td>       <td>287</td>       <td>276</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ELS/Demographics</td>       <td>401</td>       <td>244</td>       <td>491</td>       <td>254</td>       <td>430</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>New Developments</td>       <td>137</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>196</td>       <td>199</td>       <td>168</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>State Claims and Pensions</td>       <td>139</td>       <td>154</td>       <td>96</td>       <td>107</td>       <td>133</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>HSE Total</td>       <td>736</td>       <td>653</td>       <td>1,061</td>       <td>847</td>       <td>1,007*</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* An additional &euro;50m for new developments was included in the original Revised Estimate for 2020 in addition to the allocation provided in the Budget 2020 Expenditure Report.

Evidence of the clinical effectiveness of this new drug therapy was also reviewed.</p>  <p>  The recommendation is to approve access for children with genetically confirmed SMA Type I, II or III, in accordance with the controlled access criteria recommended by the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee.  The rare diseases committee recommendation was clearly targeted at the youngest and most severely affected SMA patients, and this group is the clear priority for the HSE.  The actual patient assessment and approval process will be the means for determining access on an individual case by case basis.</p>  <p>  The actual delivery of this medicine to approved patients in a safe and sustainable way requires very specific and quite complex service arrangements to be put in place by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) across all sites.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that 1-3 new children will be diagnosed with SMA Type 2 in Ireland each year.  CHI has confirmed that there are currently 34 patients with SMA aged 18 years or under who are deemed clinically eligible for treatment with Spinraza by the Paediatric Neurologist in CHI.  CHI has further confirmed that 18 patients are currently receiving Spinraza. </p>  <p>  However, other patients who were waiting to start treatment have been put on hold due to COVID-19.  CHI has confirmed that a Clinical Nurse Manager is commencing at the end of July, and that they are currently working through the remaining patients and how they can be accommodated in the midst of COVID-19 restrictions around social distancing.  Individual treatment plans are being worked up for each of the remaining patients.</p>  <p>  CHI has confirmed that it is in a continuous engagement process with families regarding their child's individual plan for the administration of Spinraza, as well as representatives of SMA Executive and Advocacy Group.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19 care alongside Covid-19 care.

Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site (<i></i>).</p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. </p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>The data requested concerning waiting list figures for Pain Relief at Galway University Hospital is outlined in the attached document.

This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation of a range of practices for the first time, including altruistic domestic surrogacy.  The General Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  The provisions relating to surrogacy are outlined in Part 6 of the General Scheme.  These provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority.  The General Scheme also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s). </p>  <p>  In addition, under the surrogacy provisions at least one of the intending parents will have to be genetically related to the child.  Surrogacy will be permitted on an altruistic basis where the payment of defined and receiptable reasonable expenses will be allowed.  However, commercial surrogacy in Ireland will be prohibited as it raises a number of concerns relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates.</p>  <p>  Drafting of the bill is ongoing in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  It is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the publication of the Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, the recently-published Programme for Government affirms this Government&rsquo;s intention to enact this legislation.</p>  <p>  Finally, it would be prudent for any individual considering taking part in a surrogacy agreement prior to the relevant legislative and regulatory framework being in place to seek legal advice on the matter.</p></reply>

Cannabis use by adolescents, in particular, is worrying as it poses risks of dependence and developing psychotic illness. Accordingly, the Government has no plans to legalise cannabis during its term of office.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out a health-led approach to drug misuse. By treating the use of substances as a public health issue, rather than solely as a criminal issue, we can better help individuals, their families and the communities in which we live. </p>  <p>  The National Drugs Strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025, provides a roadmap to achieving these aims, by promoting a more compassionate and humane approach to people who use drugs, with drug use treated first and foremost as a public health issue.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government affirms the  Government's commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Working Group on alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use, as an important step in developing a public health led approach to drug use in this country. This approach will connect people who use drugs with health services and a pathway to recovery, avoiding a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences for people, particularly younger people. The Government will undertake a review of this alternative approach to ensure it is meeting all of its aims, following the first full year of implementation, and make any necessary changes. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health, as part of the introduction of the Health Diversion Programme, is providing &euro;100,000 in 2020 to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use. </p>  <p>  I am committed to a public health approach to drug use, as it will lead to better outcomes for individuals and society. At the same time, we cannot be complacent about the risk to health posed by illegal drugs, including cannabis.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists. In line with this policy, the clinical prioritisation of patients is the responsibility of the treating Consultant.</p>  <p>  My Department has been made aware of the specific patient query raised.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p><p>The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p><p>Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.</p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site (<i></i>).</p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. </p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>The data requested concerning the tonsils surgery waiting list is outlined in the attached document.</p></reply>

Under the arrangement, all patients in private hospitals were treated as public patients while the agreement was in place. On review, the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June, and on 1st July 2020 all private hospitals reverted to private activity. The Department of Health does not have a role in the operational functions of private hospitals. </p>  <p>  More broadly in relation to testing, the HSE has developed guidance for the management of planned hospital admissions for non-COVID care which sets out advisory testing strategies for hospital patients.  This guidance seeks to provide an advisory framework for mitigating risks associated with the delivery of non-COVID care while COVID-19 continues to be prevalent, and testing provides one of a number of measures that can be taken to reduce risk. </p>  <p>  As with any procedure or test, there will be a cost.

This includes many organisations who provide specialist disability services to both adults and children.   </p>  <p>  The objective of the programme is to provide a structured governance process and modus operandi through which Section 39 partners experiencing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) can engage through the HSE to ensure, where appropriate, continuity of essential services provided by these agencies. The HSE has also developed a methodology to provide a pro forma approach to support decision making in respect of Section 39 Organisations that have made submissions to the HSE for both financial &amp;amp; non-financial supports during the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE has advised the Department that it has given Section 38 and Section 39 providers of disability services and supports assurance that budget allocations confirmed to each provider via the relevant Community Healthcare Organisation, will remain in place to year end, subject to co-operation with the HSE and compliance with the relevant Service Arrangements.</p>  <p>  The HSE and all of the providers it funds are expected to continually review their cost structures to ensure the best use of resources and a focus on the use of these resources for client care to the greatest extent possible.  The very significant additional financial resources provided to disability services over the last year, together with the achievement of relatively modest efficiency savings, form part of the financing of the increased service levels set out in the National Service Plan 2020.  It was intended that these efficiencies would be achieved in 2020 through the application of a 1% efficiency target to existing budgets across all service areas.  </p>  <p>  My Department supports the HSE in seeking efficiencies across all its spending areas. However, it is acknowledged that there will be challenges in achieving the 1% efficiency saving given the significant pressures on the disability sector in the context of COVID-19.</p></reply>

The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that it has received an application for the reimbursement of Patisiran (Onpattro&reg;) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy.</p>  <p>  In January 2019, a full health technology assessment was commissioned by the HSE.  This assessment was completed in February 2020 with the NCPE recommending that patisiran (Onpattro&reg;) is not considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.  </p>  <p>  The HTA report will be an important input into the decision making processes of the HSE. The HSE is currently reviewing the report received and has recently met with the applicant company to discuss this. </p>  <p>  Once negotiations between the HSE and the applicant company are complete, this application must then be formally considered by the HSE Drugs Group. The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The decision making authority in the HSE is the HSE Executive Management Team. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p><p>The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p><p>Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site (<i></i>).</p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. </p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>The latest National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) figures show that there are 1,324 patients on the Naas General Hospital cardiology waiting list. The NTPF have advised my Department that the average waiting time is 354 days. The data requested concerning the Naas General Hospital cardiology waiting list is also outlined in the following document. </p><p>The NTPF currently collects and collates information in respect of the Inpatient, Day Case, Planned Procedure (IDPP*) and Outpatient (OP) Waiting Lists. The requested National waiting list data is available on the NTPF website, and is available by hospital site as well as specialty at (<i></i>).</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p><p>In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p><p>The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p><p>Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p><p>The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: <i>www.hse.ie/newdirections</i>. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link. </p><p>With regard to specific service locations, service providers can provide this information directly.

Interviews for this position took place on 27 January 2020, the post is now at the final stages of recruitment through the Public Appointment Services and it is expected that it will be filled very soon.   </p>  <p>  The Programme For Government commits to the delivery of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.  As set out in the HSE&rsquo;s options appraisal, the preferred option is for a second cath lab and associated 12 bed day ward (delivering six additional beds) on the roof of the existing Cardiology Department, which will operate five days per week and provide diagnostic services only.   </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that funding was allocated in the 2019 Capital Plan for the provision of second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford, planning permission was received from Waterford City and County Council in January 2020.  Applications for fire and disability certification are currently in progress.  Preparation of contract documentation has commenced and contractor selection is underway.  Works and schedules were delayed due to COVID-19, but it is now anticipated that the project will go to tender in late August/early September.   </p>  <p>  The Herity Report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services should cease to allow the hospital focus on the much larger volume of planned work. The then Minister for Health asked the Department to address the implications of this recommendation by arranging for a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.   </p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 under the Chairmanship of Professor Phillip Nolan and a Steering Group was formed from nominations from interested stakeholders representing medical, professional/technical staff, nursing and patient representatives.   </p>  <p>  The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.   </p>  <p>  While it is hoped that the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services can be completed in the near future so that decisions can be made with regard to the continued investment and upgrading of Specialist Cardiac Services in Ireland, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has, unfortunately, had an adverse impact on its progress.</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening?

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts. </p>  <p>  On foot of the 2013 recommendations of the Interdepartmental Group, which was chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, the Government decided that the Minister for Health, in consultation with other relevant Ministers, would progress preparatory work for a new statutory scheme to provide individual payments to people with severe disabilities who require additional income to address the costs of their mobility needs.  The Interdepartmental Group met eight times between June and September that year.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there were 3,831 people in receipt of the interim payments at July 2019. </p>  <p>  Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners; the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p>  <p>  At the whole of Government level, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group.  </p>  <p>  Under the Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.   </p>  <p>  Recent developments which will impact on policy options regarding the provision of transport supports for people with a disability include the following: </p>  <p>  - The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in providing accessible public transport nationally and that Department's public consultation launched on 14 November last, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;   </p>  <p>  - The Cost of Disability Study currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; and </p>  <p>  - The Working Group established under Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy by the Department of Justice and Equality which states that:- "We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;  </p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider.</p>  <p>  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p>  <p>  HIQA in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing homes meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  During the response to COVID-19, Nursing homes continue to be regulated by HIQA, who under the Health Act 2007 have the legal authority to examine the operation of any facility under their remit.</p>  <p>  Furthermore on foot of a National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendation, on 23 May a COVID-19 Expert Panel on Nursing Homes was established, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Panel is to examine the national and international responses to the COVID-19 crisis, and to examine the emerging best practice. Its main objective is to provide immediate real-time learnings and recommendations in light of the expected ongoing impact of COVID-19 over the next 12-18 months.  COVID-19 is a new disease, which can present atypically in the frail elderly, and new evidence and best practice in its management are constantly emerging. I expect the Expert Panel to submit their final report to me later this month. </p>  <p>  In relation to this particular nursing home, I can confirm that my Department has received correspondence in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy and has forwarded on details to HIQA as the statutory regulator for nursing homes, and the HSE for appropriate action and follow up.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of. </p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link.  </p>  <p>  Regarding services more widely, including children's services, the HSE and its partner service providers are endeavouring to maintain essential support services during this unprecedented public health emergency. HSE Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) are continuing to proactively engage with disability service providers to ensure that appropriate contingency arrangements are made so that the necessary supports are put in place for persons with disabilities and their families. In the absence of regular access to some service and supports, CHOs and service providers tried to maintain services that can be delivered safely; providing outreach and telecare solutions, using technology where possible; and using creative and innovative models of care to support service users, both adults and children. </p>  <p>  The HSE is very aware of the impact of the pandemic on people with disabilities, their families and carers and have over the past few weeks developed a number of working groups to plan and develop guidance on how we will be able to deliver supports, albeit in a new way and under the Public Health guidance. </p>  <p>  In this regard and whilst accepting that very significant levels of vital therapies have been temporarily curtailed, it is important to emphasise that the HSE is now in the process of detailed planning in order to recover these services in line with the Governments&rsquo; Roadmap. It is important to note that this must be supported by way of assurance and oversight from the HSE&rsquo;s Chief Clinical Officer along with the National Public Health Emergency Team, so that we can do so in a safe manner.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p><p>The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p><p>Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.</p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().</p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. </p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>The NTPF currently collects and collates information in respect of the Inpatient, Day Case, Planned Procedure (IDPP*) and Outpatient (OP) Waiting Lists. National waiting lists data by hospital site and by specialty is published by the NTPF on their website (. ) and is publically available. </p><p>The end of year waiting lists for IPDC and OPD from 2016 until 2019, and for June 2020 is outlined in the attached documents. Data requested in regard to UHW is also attached.</p></reply>

In the context of the current COVID-19 Pandemic response, the HSE advised on 22 June 2020 that an additional 324 acute beds have opened since March, bringing the current total of acute beds in the system to 11,597 excluding critical care capacity. It should be noted that this is the total current bed capacity. However, beds are unavailable when they are temporarily closed for reasons such as infection control, maintenance/refurbishment, or staffing shortages.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Critical Care Programme Census from September 2019 reported that there were 255 adult critical care beds in public hospitals. At an early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, additional funding was provided to the HSE to increase the number of critical care beds. 42 critical care beds have been funded since March in addition to the baseline critical care capacity already identified in hospitals. </p>  <p>  In line with the HSE&rsquo;s Critical Care Major Surge Preparedness Planning Framework, surge plans for further capacity for each Hospital Group have been developed in order to create additional capacity if required. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's request for a breakdown by site, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly. </p></reply>

As set out in the HSE&rsquo;s options appraisal, the preferred option is for a second cath lab and associated 12 bed day ward (delivering six additional beds) on the roof of the existing Cardiology Department, which will operate five days per week and provide diagnostic services only. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that funding was allocated in the 2019 Capital Plan for the provision of second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford, planning permission was received from Waterford City and County Council in January 2020.  Applications for fire and disability certification are currently in progress.  Preparation of contract documentation has commenced and contractor selection is underway.  Works and schedules were delayed due to COVID-19, but it is now anticipated that the project will go to tender in late August/early September. </p>  <p>  The Herity Report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services should cease to allow the hospital focus on the much larger volume of planned work. The then Minister for Health asked the Department to address the implications of this recommendation by arranging for a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.</p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 under the Chairmanship of Professor Phillip Nolan and a Steering Group was formed from nominations from interested stakeholders representing medical, professional/technical staff, nursing and patient representatives. </p>  <p>  The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. </p>  <p>  While it is hoped that the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services can be completed in the near future so that decisions can be made with regard to the continued investment and upgrading of Specialist Cardiac Services in Ireland, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has, unfortunately, had an adverse impact on its progression.</p></reply>

The Bill was published on July 01, 2020 and it is expected to proceed through the Houses of the Oireachtas in mid-July. </p>  <p>  The initial stage of this phased expansion will be the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 and 8.  I am currently reviewing the situation in relation to this expansion to determine how and when this expanded service can be introduced in a way which will meet the ongoing health needs of children and will also be sustainable for General Practice in the current COVID environment.</p></reply>

An early priority of the new Policy was the roll-out of packages of care for children under 6 in 2020, however, this has been delayed because of the necessary concentration of resources at managing the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

The community oral healthcare services will centre on vulnerable and special care support services, as well as on needs assessment for people in residential settings and others who require additional supports.</p>  <p>  The Policy recognises the need for a suitably skilled workforce to provide appropriate oral healthcare across all settings. This workforce will include oral healthcare professionals providing the highest level of care in advanced oral healthcare centres or in secondary/tertiary care centres, as well as oral healthcare professionals providing oral healthcare advice and preventive care directly to the public in primary oral healthcare settings. A protected educational, training and research environment will be a priority for the implementation of the Policy.</p>  <p>  The detail of workforce requirements will be agreed as part of the implementation process. At present it remains difficult to quantify what the public health sector's future workforce requirements will be, as we are still in the process of managing the current COVID-19 crisis.

In light of these unprecedented challenges, the HSE, at the outset, had to reassess its operation of Home Support Services nationally, to ensure that the assessed needs of those clients with the highest priority were and still are being met. The HSE, working with its approved home support service providers are endeavouring to maintain essential support services during this unprecedented public health emergency.  In this context, the HSE has set out a prioritisation process for home support, which looks at delivering a service based on priority need across 4 priority categories.   </p>  <p>  As a result of that review of prioritisation, a number of clients with lower priority needs had their home support service temporarily ceased or reduced with the support of family members and/or alternative forms of volunteer provided local supports. In these cases, each client was contacted to advise of the assessment and decision, alternative support available and assistance given to ensure that essential requirements continue to be provided. The HSE continues to review both those clients whose home support service may have been temporarily suspended and those clients of higher priority currently in receipt of home support services. </p>  <p>  The HSE is in the process of restoring services, where capacity exists. In order to maximise the capacity available, consideration has to be given to balancing delivery of service against suspended clients, clients assessed and waiting on commencement of home support services and the continued requirement to meet the needs of higher priority clients currently in receipt of services. </p>  <p>  Having regard to broader public finances, I am committed to prioritising continued investment in the home support services. COVID-19 has shown that these services are needed now, more than ever, to keep people safe and well in their own homes.</p>  <p>  The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2021, and future years, and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE, including home support will be considered as part of the annual national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts.  </p>  <p>  On foot of the 2013 recommendations of the Interdepartmental Group, which was chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, the Government decided that the Minister for Health, in consultation with other relevant Ministers, would progress preparatory work for a new statutory scheme to provide individual payments to people with severe disabilities who require additional income to address the costs of their mobility needs.  The Interdepartmental Group met eight times between June and September that year.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there were 3,831 people in receipt of the interim payments at July 2019. </p>  <p>  Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners; the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p>  <p>  At the whole of Government level, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group.  </p>  <p>  Under the Strategy,  the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.   </p>  <p>  Recent developments which will impact on policy options regarding the provision of transport supports for people with a disability include the following: </p>  <p>  The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in providing accessible public transport nationally and that Department's public consultation launched on 14 November last, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;   </p>  <p>  The Cost of Disability Study currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; and </p>  <p>  The Working Group established under Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy by the Department of Justice and Equality which states that:- "We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;  </p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p><p>In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p><p>The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p><p>Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time.

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan. The decision to delay appointments and admissions is not undertaken lightly and when such a decision is made, it is based on the safe delivery of care to all patients.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Responsibility for enforcement of food legislation is managed through service contracts between the FSAI and a number of competent authorities, also known as &lsquo;Official Agencies&rsquo;.  These official agencies include the Health Service Executive (HSE); Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM); Local Authorities (LAs); and Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.</p>  <p>  The LAs&rsquo; service contract is provided by the Local Authority Veterinary Service (LAVS). LAs, acting on behalf of the FSAI, are responsible for food law enforcement required under EU food law at over 500 food businesses (including small meat manufacturing plants, slaughterhouses, cold stores, etc.).</p>  <p>  In addition to food safety controls, the LAVS also carries out functions for other Government Departments, including overseeing the enforcement of animal health and welfare legislation at slaughterhouses, on-farm emergency slaughter and the verification of competence to slaughter by plant operatives.  LAs also have statutory responsibility in relation to dog and horse control, dog licensing and the regulation of dog breeding establishments.</p>  <p>  The annual funding provided by the Department of Health to the FSAI is inclusive of funding for the LAVS service contract.  While funded by the Department, the FSAI is independent in the exercise of its functions.  There have been a number of meetings between officials in my Department and the Authority regarding the FSAI budget, including the LAVS service contract. </p>  <p>  I understand that due to financial pressures across the FSAI budget, FSAI had indicated to the LAs in early 2020 that it would not be in a position to provide the same amount this year that it had provided for LAVS in 2019.  In early May 2020, my Department advised the FSAI that it has increased its non-capital funding for 2020 by 7.5% (an additional &euro;1.2m), bringing its total annual non-capital allocation to &euro;17.172m.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, FSAI advised the LAs through the County and City Management Association (CCMA) that it is now able to allocate funding to the LAs (in 2020) closer to the amount it provided in 2019. Furthermore, the FSAI has advised my Department that a three-month extension (until 30th September 2020) has been agreed between the FSAI and the LAs/CCMA on the present LAVS service contracts, which will allow FSAI to review the service with the aim of finding a longer-term solution with an appropriately funded and sustainable operational/service model.  My Department will also seek engagement with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), the LAs&rsquo; parent Department.</p>  <p>  The FSAI has advised my Department that it has, in recent years, provided the following funding to the LAs for the delivery of the Local Authority Veterinary Service:</p>  <p>  - 2017: &euro;6,030,266.62</p>  <p>  - 2018: &euro;6,229,317.08</p>  <p>  - 2019: &euro;6,199,697.21</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised concerning the number of outpatient hospital cancellations for February, March, April and June 2020 by hospital and hospital group in tabular form, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

More than ever, attention is paid to not just physical pain, but to psychosocial and spiritual issues too. Palliative care also offers emotional support to both the patient and their families, addressing the fears they may have and giving comfort when necessary.</p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s desire that all people will be provided with the type of palliative care services that they need, regardless of their diagnosis, their age or where they die.</p>  <p>  While many people want, and are able, to die at home with support from their general practitioner and community specialist palliative care teams, it is accepted that others require support from an inpatient palliative care unit, or hospice. In north Dublin, St. Francis Hospice provides inpatient services at Blanchardstown and Raheny. Referral to the hospice is made by the GP, hospital doctor or consultant of the person with a life-limiting condition.</p>  <p>  For those approaching death while living at home, the Irish Cancer Society and Irish Hospice Foundation operate the Night Nursing Service, an end-of-life nursing care programme. This can be used by people with a cancer or a non-malignant diagnosis. The Irish Cancer Society funds care for people with a cancer diagnosis, while the Irish Hospice Foundation funds care for those with a non-cancer diagnosis. The Service can be accessed through referral from the Specialist Community Palliative Care Team, Public Health Nurse, GP or hospital-based Specialist Palliative Care Team.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to directly reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link.  </p>  <p>  With regard to specific service locations, service providers can provide this information directly.

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link.</p></reply>

The availability of appointments as well as visitor restrictions may vary between hospitals. Non-COVID services are now starting back gradually. </p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services, including phlebotomy services, on a private basis. The fees charged by individual GPs for private consultations are a matter of private contract between clinicians and their patients.</p>  <p>  Persons who are eligible for GP care without charge under the Health Act 1970 are not subject to any co-payments or other charges in respect of such services. There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for medical card or GP visit card holders to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition and the HSE has advised GPs accordingly.</p>  <p>  I am aware that, nonetheless, some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  The GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in from this year will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care.</p>  <p>  However, it remains a matter of concern to me that a medical card or GP visit card patient might be charged for blood tests which are clinically necessary and I have asked my officials to discuss with the HSE what further solutions to this issue may be possible.  If such a patient believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Residential settings are people&rsquo;s homes as well as places where health and social care are provided. The introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. During these times there has been a particular emphasis on retaining a holistic view of the wellbeing of residents, remaining person-centred, being cognisant of their rights as citizens, and being vigilant that in seeking to shield them from infection that these rights are not infringed upon in to an extent, or in a manner, that is disproportionate.  </p><p>However, it is important to recall that people living in long-term residential care (LTRC) facilities are particularly vulnerable populations in the context of Covid-19 and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be at a higher risk of being susceptible to infection from this disease and for subsequent adverse outcomes.</p><p>The actions and measures we have taken in Ireland to support long term residential care facilities and their residents have evolved on foot of epidemiological data and guidance from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). These measures have been both society wide as well as focused specifically on residential facilities. Advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) focused on all LTRC settings and its recommended actions were relevant for all residential care services - older people, disability and mental health settings.</p><p>As the disease is becoming more suppressed in the community the National Public Health Emergency has advised that the gradual reintroduction of usual activities while taking public health precautions should commence. This advice is reflected in the latest Cocooning and visiting guidance. Detail of this guidance is set out by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre at: .</p><p>The Department of Health is very much aware of how difficult the current restrictions on visiting are for residents and their families. Families are encouraged to talk to the support staff at the person&rsquo;s residence, to make arrangements for visits and other activities that can be facilitated within the current public health guidance. While it is appropriate in line with the public health cocooning guidance for activities outside the home to commence, it is important to balance the risk involved in prolonged periods of time outside the home. These risks will continue to be reviewed in line with the disease progression and guidelines will be updated.</p></reply>

Under the arrangement, all patients in private hospitals were treated as public patients while the agreement was in place. On review, the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June, and on 1st July 2020 all private hospitals reverted to private activity. The Department of Health does not have a role in the operational functions of private hospitals. </p>  <p>  More broadly in relation to testing, the HSE has developed guidance for the management of planned hospital admissions for non-COVID care which sets out advisory testing strategies for hospital patients.  This guidance seeks to provide an advisory framework for mitigating risks associated with the delivery of non-COVID care while COVID-19 continues to be prevalent, and testing provides one of a number of measures that can be taken to reduce risk. </p>  <p>  As with any procedure or test, there will be a cost. I am not in a position to comment on what the actual cost may be in private hospitals, however, I understand that the costs arising from testing for COVID-19 in public hospitals is much lower than the upper charges quoted by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  In addition, I can confirm that the NTPF have advised my Department that no patient is liable for any charge from a private hospital for services arranged by the NTPF.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

These are related but separate services and each is funded separately. While the resources for the provision of assisted living services available are substantial they are finite. The 2020 national service plan allocated &euro;1m additional funding to PA services.</p>  <p>  PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers.</p>  <p>  The presence and threat of COVID-19 in Ireland has resulted in significant challenges for service providers, families and most importantly, people with disabilities. During these challenging times disability services such as residential services, day services, home supports, Personal Assistant supports, respite services and children&rsquo;s services were either suspended or delivered in alternative ways following Public Health guidance. The changes in service delivery have resulted in significant stressors being placed on families and individuals with disabilities across Ireland. In times of such uncertainty it was imperative that the vulnerable members of our community remained supported by our service providers, therefore, it was essential that a shift in focus occurred in terms of how services were delivered. </p>  <p>  One of the primary opportunities which has occurred as a result of the presence of COVID-19 has been that the pandemic has acted as a catalyst to the development of alternative models of service delivery . It is from this position that the reshaping process of services occur and consideration is given to how services will now be best delivered, mindful of the assessed individualised needs and wishes of people with disabilities and in accordance with Government Public Health guidelines. During this planning phase, there is a need to engage with individuals and, as appropriate, with their families, in reshaping what people with disabilities choose that their day should look like in order to have a meaningful life.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and HSE have agreed that the provision of Home Support services should be prioritised in order to maintain and support people to continue to live in their own homes and to provide support and help families and carers. </p>  <p>  Considerations for reshaping Home Supports are as follows; Where home support hours were reduced due to COVID-19 public health requirements, a rigorous assessment of need including a risk assessment of infection control issues, must occur to determine what reshaping of supports should be delivered. Where a reassessment determines hours should be re-instated and can be delivered in accordance with public health guidance, this should occur. Where a reassessment determines hours are not to be reinstated for whatever reason, a meaningful conversation should be held with the individual and where appropriate with family, to identify what supports are most appropriate and what has been learned during the COVID-19 restrictions in terms of changing needs and wishes, resilience etc.</p>  <p>  The Disability Sector is re-establishing a number of structures, as well as other operational structures, that will co-ordinate and support the sector as we continue to navigate this pandemic and make every effort to deliver home supports in line with Public Health Guidance.</p></reply>

Human rights principles, in common with normative ethical principles are rooted in values of respect for persons, dignity, justice and equality. </p>  <p>  Respect for human rights and dignity of persons is an integral part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In recognition of this, the Pandemic Ethics Advisory Group (PEAG) was established as an expert subgroup of the NPHET.  The PEAG is multidisciplinary in composition and includes members from a broad range of relevant fields, including ethics, medicine, law and patient advocacy. </p>  <p>  The subgroup has developed a broad range of national ethical guidance throughout the course of the Covid-19 pandemic with a view to supporting healthcare workers, managers and policy makers as they navigate their way through the ethical challenges and difficult decisions they are called upon to make during this challenging time.  The Ethical Framework for Decision Making in a Pandemic and the supporting documents produced by PEAG clearly articulate the importance of fairness, inclusiveness, proportionality, and non-discrimination, all of which are enshrined Human Rights principles. </p>  <p>  Given the volatility of the public health emergency and the urgent need for relevant guidance to be produced to address it, it was not feasible or appropriate to the circumstances to conduct an extensive consultation process when developing these guidance documents.  However, they were reviewed by senior medical experts from a number of professional bodies including; the Joint Faculty of the Intensive Care Society of Ireland, the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, the College of Anaesthesiologists of Ireland, and the HSE&rsquo;s National Clinical Programmes. </p>  <p>  The pandemic continues to evolve and the Ethics Guidance documents will be kept under review.  Consideration will be given to the appropriateness of broader consultation as part of this process.</p></reply>

Under the arrangement, all patients in private hospitals were treated as public patients while the agreement was in place.  On review, the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June, and on 1st July 2020 all private hospitals reverted to private activity.  The Department of Health does not have a role in the operational functions of private hospitals.</p>  <p>  More broadly in relation to testing, the HSE has developed guidance for the management of planned hospital admissions for non-COVID care which sets out advisory testing strategies for hospital patients.  This guidance seeks to provide an advisory framework for mitigating risks associated with the delivery of non-COVID care while COVID-19 continues to be prevalent, and testing provides one of a number of measures that can be taken to reduce risk. </p>  <p>  As with any procedure or test, there will be a cost.  I am not in a position to comment on what the actual cost may be in private hospitals, however, I understand that the costs arising from testing for COVID-19 in public hospitals is much lower than the upper charges quoted by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  In addition, I can confirm that the NTPF have advised my Department that no patient is liable for any charge from a private hospital for services arranged by the NTPF.</p></reply>

The Cabinet Committee reviewed the guidance, which state that an assessment should be carried out for each premises to determine how many can attend within the requirements of social distancing.  </p><p>The Cabinet Committee decided that where the size of the premises allows for a capacity of greater than 50 this may be permitted only where:</p><p>- Social distancing guidelines are adhered to </p><p>- The premises can be subdivided into distinct sections (cordoned or marked appropriately) of not more than 50 persons in each section </p><p>- There is a minimum of 4m between sections </p><p>- Each section has its own entrance/exit route</p><p>- There are separate arrangements for elements of the service involving close contact, e.g. the distribution of Holy Communion </p><p>- Strictly no movement of people between sections before, during or after the service</p><p>- The premises is well-ventilated.</p><p>Account must also be taken regarding the risk of congregation by people outside before and after any services, having regard to outdoor overall limits on mass gatherings and arrangements for staggered exiting after ceremonies.</p><p>The use of face coverings is strongly recommended for such indoor settings.</p></reply>

Within the Accelerator, Gavi, CEPI, and WHO together with multinational and developing country vaccine manufacturers are working on the COVAX (vaccine) Pillar to develop the COVAX Facility.</p>  <p>  The Facility provides governments with the opportunity to benefit from a large portfolio of COVID-19 candidate vaccines using a range of technology platforms, produced by more manufacturers across the world, with a bigger market to provide security of demand &ndash; often with greater scope than governments or regional groups can support on their own.  Even where governments already have access to a portfolio of candidate vaccines, it acts as an insurance policy through economies of scale and portfolio diversification.</p>  <p>  Ireland has signed an expression of Interest letter indicating interest in  participating in the Covax Facility, and accordingly in procuring vaccines from the Facility for the country. </p>  <p>  In addition, to ensure that Europeans have access to a vaccine in a timely and fair manner, the European Commission proposes to conclude a number of advance purchase agreements with vaccine manufacturers.  The contracts with companies would take the form of Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs) and would be concluded through a procurement process run by the Commission on behalf of all participating Member States.  The related funding would come from the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI).  The budgetary authorities, the European Parliament and the Council, have made EUR 2.7 billion available under the ESI.  The Commission stands ready to commit the large majority of those funds to APA-related activities.</p>  <p>  This process will respect the principle of subsidiarity and Member States competences as the central procurement action would only conclude the APAs with all relevant conditions, whereas the actual purchase and subsequent use of the vaccines product under the resulting framework contract would remain under the responsibility of the individual Member States.</p>  <p>  A Steering Board has been established to run the procurement centrally and efficiently.  The SB is chaired by the Commission and includes senior officials from all interested Member States to assist and provide guidance throughout the evaluation process.  Ireland is represented on the Steering Board.  For full transparency, the Commission proposes to report regularly to the Integrated Crisis Political Response (IPCR) on overall progress more generally.</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p><p>In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p><p>The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance.  It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p><p>Day services will gradually resume during the month of August.  Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance.  Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p><p>As services resume it will be necessary to identify how transport can continue to be provided in as safe a manner as possible and strictly within social distancing and other COVID-19 precautions.  Transport providers will have to demonstrate that their transport services are safe and that all COVID-19 precautions have been established and observed.  The guidance includes general guidelines and a risk assessment matrix on safe transport.</p><p>With regard to school leavers, the HSE are continuing to plan to meet the needs of all young people leaving school and people leaving Rehabilitation Programmes in 2020 that may require a HSE funded Adult Disability Day Service.  Ring-fenced resources to facilitate this have been provided as part of the HSE's National Service Plan 2020.  People that have left school and require a day service will be introduced to a new service during September, and school leavers referred to the HSE can continue to communicate with their contact person by telephone or email.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time.  Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p><p>The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: .  The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link.  </p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p><p>In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p><p>The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance.  It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p><p>Day services will gradually resume during the month of August.  Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance.  Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time.  Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p><p>The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: <i>www.hse.ie/newdirections</i>.  The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link.  </p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases.  The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. </p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and a Rare Disease Office.  Building on this progress to date, themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and the Irish Platform for Patent Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI).  The Rare Disease Plan is now firmly embedded in the work of the HSE Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office.  This programme is now under the governance of the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. </p>  <p>  Meetings to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the continuing work ongoing in relation to Rare Diseases take place at regular intervals with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office. </p>  <p>  In addition, a number of key themes have been identified for future progress, including: Patient Awareness; European Reference Networks; Research &amp;amp; Registries; Access to Services; Access to Medicines; Diagnosis; Education &amp;amp; Training and Legislation &amp;amp; Policy.</p></reply>

In recent years there has been increased investment in paediatric orthopaedics and scoliosis services, which has improved access to surgery and outpatient appointments.  In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI; previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services.  As a result of this additional funding since 2018, CHI advise that there have been many improvements in paediatric scoliosis services, with increased activity and improved waiting times to access appointments and procedures. </p>  <p>  CHI had advised my Department that they continue to develop sustainable solutions to reduce waiting times for children attending their orthopaedic and scoliosis services.  The additional investment from the HSE in recent years and the implementation of the Scoliosis 10 Point Action Plan has increased orthopaedic activity levels across CHI.  In addition, CHI has also advised my Department that a General Orthopaedic Surgeon, based at CHI Crumlin and Tallaght sites, is due to commence in Q3, 2020.  This post is for general orthopaedic and trauma surgery, to support waiting list activity, and will further support waiting times for children for general orthopaedic outpatient appointments, including scoliosis.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with both CHI and the HSE in relation to paediatric scoliosis services. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised and the specific breakdown of information requested, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Through the Dementia Understand Together Campaign, led by the HSE, and collaboration with other key stakeholders, a range of initiatives and resources have been developed to ensure that people living with dementia stay safe, well and connected, during this time of crisis.  In addition, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland has played a key role in supporting people living with dementia in the home following the suspension of their day and respite services, through social and activity engagement calls, telephone support and family carer training. </p><p>The HSE has adapted its community services in order to provide a flexible response so that the needs of people with dementia continue to be met during the Covid-19 crisis.  Primary care team support is operating nationwide, with referrals being made to community supports, including the Alzheimer Society of Ireland&rsquo;s dementia adviser service and the local authority community response forums.  While home visits have been necessarily restricted, the HSE uses prioritisation and screening measures to identify clients needing home visits.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, people with dementia living in residential settings experience specific challenges.  23 Covid response teams have been established across network of Community Health Care Organisations (CHO) and these teams have geriatrician input, ensuring that the needs of the person living with dementia are incorporated into the overall plan for each nursing home. </p><p>As part of the public health follow-up of confirmed cases of Covid-19, information is routinely collected by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on whether a case has certain medical conditions, including chronic neurological disease.  While I appreciate that many health professionals and organisations working with people with dementia would like to have dementia explicitly included as an underlying condition, the HPSC has to limit the number of conditions on its surveillance forms for the sake of brevity, as the people being interviewed are either caring for a very ill person or are very ill themselves. </p><p>The HSE is currently engaged in detailed operational planning across the primary and community sector that will underpin the phased resumption of community services, including supports for people with dementia, over the period ahead.  This work will align with the recently published document &ldquo;Service Continuity in a COVID Environment &ndash; A Strategic Framework for Delivery&rdquo; which is available on the HSE&rsquo;s website at <i>.</i></p></reply>

This report may add to that evidence and learning.</p>  <p>  Over the past two decades, Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) Mesh has been widely used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women.  Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, considerable work has been done to date and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants; and the patient voice is central to our understanding of these, and similar, issues. As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.  Any engagement process will need to take account of the wider context relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Concerns were raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, including a number of Ministerial representations from the women affected or on their behalf.  At that time, the Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such      procedures.</p>  <p>  This CMO Report was published in November 2018. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the CMO report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery. </p>  <p>  Since July 2018, the HSE has paused all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This was at the request of the CMO and undertaken in advance of completion of the final CMO report. The pause was instigated pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of initial recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The CMO report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional procedures.  However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p>  <p>  The CMO report made a number of recommendations, the implementation of which will provide significant assurance that both women presenting for treatment and who develop mesh-related complications, receive high quality, multi-disciplinary patient centred care in accordance with the evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms.</p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) is progressing treatment pathways and referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications. </p>  <p>  A multidisciplinary National Specialist Centre is being developed over 2 sites at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin.  In addition, two translabial scanners, were procured by the HSE in late 2019, and are now on-site in both hospitals.  However, the first scanning clinic, which was due to take place last March had to be postponed, due to the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. </p>  <p>  I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.  </p></reply>

This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation of a range of practices for the first time, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research.  The General Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  Drafting of the bill is ongoing, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  It is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the publication of the Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.

The current advice is that you should follow social distancing guidance everywhere outside the home, including keeping a physical distance of 2 metres apart. It is also currently recommended that face coverings be worn in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as shops, and on public transport, or when meeting someone who is vulnerable to the virus, for example people who are cocooning. The recommendation applies to those people aged over 13 who can tolerate them.</p>  <p>  Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. </p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and a Rare Disease Office.  Building on this progress to date, themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI).  The Rare Disease Plan is now firmly embedded in the work of the HSE Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office. This programme operated under the governance of the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. </p>  <p>  Meetings to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the continuing work ongoing in relation to Rare Diseases take place at regular intervals with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office. </p>  <p>  In addition, a number of key themes have been identified for future progress, including: Patient Awareness; European Reference Networks; Research &amp;amp; Registries; Access to Services; Access to Medicines; Diagnosis; Education &amp;amp; Training and Legislation &amp;amp; Policy.</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link.</p></reply>

The Commission of Investigation (Certain matters relative to a disability service in the South East and related matters), &ldquo;the Farrelly Commission&rdquo;, was established by Government under S.I No. 96 of 2017, Commission of Investigation Certain matters relative to a disability service in the South East and related matters) Order 2017 to investigate the care and protection of &ldquo;Grace&rdquo; (pseudonym) and others in a former foster home in the South East, which has been the subject of abuse allegations.  </p>  <p>  The first phase of the Farrelly Commission&rsquo;s work is to investigate the role of public authorities in the care and protection of Grace, who resided with a former foster family in the South East of Ireland between 1989 and 2009. Phase 2 will commence following consideration of the Phase 1 Final Report and the Commission&rsquo;s written statement on the scope of its further investigations.  </p>  <p>  The Farrelly Commission commenced work on 15 May 2017 and was due to submit its Final Phase 1 Report within one year of commencing its work.  </p>  <p>  The Farrelly Commission wrote to my predecessor as Minister for Health (Simon Harris, T.D.) to request a ten-week preliminary extension until Friday, 24 July 2020, to allow it to identify the time needed to complete its Phase 1 Final Report. Minister Harris granted the extension. He made this decision following discussion with his colleague, the Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Disabilities, Finian McGrath and his Cabinet colleagues.  </p>  <p>  This is the Farrelly Commission&rsquo;s third extension. It is in addition to the two twelve-month extensions that were granted by Minister Harris in May 2018 and May 2019.  </p>  <p>  The Farrelly Commission&rsquo;s costs to date are &euro;5,247,054.55. The final cost of the Commission will be determined by my decision on the submission that the Farrelly Commission will provide to me by 24 July 2020 setting out the length of time that it has identified to allow it to complete its Phase 1 work and make its report.</p>  <p>  2. The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal was established on a non-statutory basis in December 1995 to compensate people who had contracted Hepatitis C through the administration of Anti-D immunoglobulin, whole blood, or other blood products within the State.  It was put on a statutory footing in November 1997 by means of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act.  The Tribunal&rsquo;s remit was extended in 2002 to include individuals who had contracted HIV and to provide for additional heads of claim for the dependants of infected persons &ndash; loss of consortium, dependency losses, loss of society, post-traumatic stress disorder/nervous shock and future care claims.  In 2006, the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act was further amended to provide for the establishment of an insurance scheme. </p>  <p>  The Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal will continue in existence until the last person infected with Hepatitis C dies and any claim lodged by their dependents is heard.  </p>  <p>  The total cost of the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal from 1995 to end December 2018 is  &euro;1.195bn.  The estimated cost of the Tribunal in 2019 is &euro;16.62m. These figures are provisional pending the publication of the Annual Report for 2019.  This Scheme is demand led and it is impossible to know precisely how much it will cost from year to year.  The Scheme has cost an average of approximately &euro;20m per annum over the last 5 years.</p></reply>
