I attended the GAC (Article 50) on 20 July and 18 September. On both occasions, I met separately with Michel Barnier and I also met briefly with a range of EU colleagues. In addition, in August I attended the German Ambassadors&rsquo; Conference in Berlin and held a meeting with my German opposite number, Heiko Maas. On 4-5 September, I travelled to Estonia, Lithuania and Finland where I met with my Estonian, Lithuanian and Finnish counterparts. I was in Warsaw yesterday for meetings with the Polish Foreign Minister and European Affairs Minister.</p>  <p>   In all my meetings, I am struck by the solidarity and unity of our EU partners with Ireland on the issue of the backstop, and I am grateful for their continued public and private expressions of support.  </p>  <p>  On the UK side, in July, I met with the then recently appointed UK Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union, Dominic Raab, in London to discuss the current state of play in the negotiations, and in particular the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. I also met briefly with Jeremy Hunt, following his appointment as UK Foreign Secretary, in August, in Vienna, and with David Lidington, the UK Minister of the Cabinet Office, in September, in Dublin. In these meetings, I emphasised that it was the responsibility of the UK to put forward viable and workable proposals for the backstop, and encouraged the UK to engage constructively on the issue. </p>  <p>  In September, I also met Keir Starmer, Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, during his visit to Dublin. </p></reply>

In particular, Ireland supports the EU regulation on conflict minerals. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation leads on this area in coordination with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>  <p>  The Kimberley Process is an intergovernmental process, supported by the United Nations, to control the entry of diamonds to the world market, and prevent the exploitation of diamonds by rebels and warlords in diamond producing countries. Once diamonds have entered the market in an approved way, there is no reason to treat them differently from any other product.</p>  <p>  This is not a general mechanism for policing human rights issues in every country through which those diamonds subsequently pass.</p>  <p>  The suggestion of sanctions on Israel has been made many times by the Deputy and others, and discussed here in the House. Restrictions on trade would have to be imposed at EU or UN level. The Government does not support the imposition of sanctions on Israel, and such a proposal would have no possibility of reaching agreement at EU level. </p>  <p>  I have no proposals for a different approach in relation to diamonds.</p></reply>

The notice to residents to demolish their own structures by 1 October or face enforced demolition clearly indicates that Israel is intent on carrying out this reprehensible action.</p>  <p>  These villagers have already been expelled once from their original homes in Israel, and they should have been protected by the occupation authorities, not subjected to further injustice. They have not consented to moving, and it is virtually impossible for them to obtain planning permission from Israeli authorities for housing or other structures in their village.</p>  <p>  The forced removal of the Bedouin community to another site is illegal under international law, which clearly prohibits the destruction of private property and the forcible transfer of the population of an occupied territory.</p>  <p>  The clearing of Palestinians from this particularly sensitive location in the West Bank is critically damaging to the viability of a future Palestinian state, and thus to the prospects for a peace agreement.  </p>  <p>  I have made two public statements, in May and July this year, expressing my concerns about Khan al Ahmar, and calling on the Israeli authorities to halt these demolitions and the removal of Palestinian communities. I reiterated these concerns in my speech to the UN General Assembly last week. I have also made Ireland&rsquo;s views on settlements known directly to the Prime Minister of Israel. </p>  <p>  Irish representatives in Ramallah have visited Khan al Ahmar on several occasions, along with EU colleagues, as a show of support for the villagers. Ireland has also pressed strongly for EU action, and the EU has called on Israel to reverse this policy both in private and in public statements, including last month by the EU High Representative on behalf of the EU. </p></reply>

It is my firm view, which I believe is shared across the Oireachtas, that a collective effort is the only way to address global challenges such as conflict, migration and climate change which are often linked.  </p><p>Our National Statement also provided the opportunity to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s role in UN peacekeeping, disarmament and humanitarian assistance; and to underscore Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding the situation in the Middle East. I also reconfirmed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income for Official Development Assistance by 2030.</p><p>Immediately prior to the General Debate the Taoiseach addressed the Mandela Peace Summit. With South Africa, Ireland successfully co-facilitated the Mandela Peace Summit Declaration which was adopted by consensus by the General Assembly.  It was an honour for Ireland to be chosen to work in partnership with South Africa on the Declaration.</p><p>During the visit to the UN, I and the Minister of State for Development and Diaspora attended a number of events on themes of women, peace and security; international criminal justice; education; health; humanitarian response and climate action.</p><p>A central objective of my visit, and those of the Taoiseach and Minister of State Cannon, was to make a strong case for Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.</p><p>We held a wide range of bilateral meetings, with UN Member States from all regions.  The Taoiseach, Minister of State Cannon and I met with a number of Heads of State and Government and Ministers and received a strong hearing on our campaign, which is based on Ireland&rsquo;s track record of engagement at the UN and on the principles of empathy, partnership and independence which underlie our campaign. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-04a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100400047#WRA01800"><p>The European Commission&rsquo;s proposals on the &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; are set out in the Draft Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, which forms part of the overall draft Withdrawal Agreement published in February. It is available on the European Commission&rsquo;s website and on the Government&rsquo;s Brexit website. </p>  <p>  This draft text serves as the basis on which negotiations have been conducted so far. It sets out the basic elements for a legally operable &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; which avoids a hard border on this island and protects the integrity of the EU Single Market.   </p>  <p>  This reflects the commitments on avoiding a hard border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, made by Prime Minister May in December 2017, and again in March.</p>  <p>  In an effort to finalise negotiations, Michel Barnier has spoken of efforts to &ldquo;de-dramatise&rdquo; the backstop. These would focus on the technical aspects of the backstop in terms of the location and modalities of the controls necessary to protect the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union, in the event that the backstop should ever need to be implemented. This would maintain the key principle of the backstop, to maintain the invisible border as it is today. Mr Barnier briefed EU leaders at the informal European Council Summit in Salzburg and received full and unanimous support for his approach, from all partners, including Ireland. </p>  <p>  Last month, Prime Minister May announced that the UK would now bring forward their own proposals for a backstop arrangement. The Government welcomes this announcement.  We have long called for the UK to engage fully with this issue. However, time is short, and it is important that these proposals are tabled with the Commission Taskforce as soon as possible, to allow negotiations make progress before the October European Council.</p>  <p>  Although the text of the backstop may be subject to change, our objectives do not. Our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues.  However, it remains essential that a legally operable backstop is agreed which provides certainty that a hard border will be avoided in any circumstances. Therefore it cannot be temporary and must be in place unless and until another solution is found. This position is supported and shared by our fellow EU27 Member States, and by the European Commission. </p></reply>

The distribution of work across the 3 passport offices does not in any way or limit the options available to the public in terms of passport application channels or reduce the quality of service provided.  </p>  <p>  Currently, the Cork office processes applications from Northern Ireland and Great Britain, as well as applications submitted at Ireland&rsquo;s network of Embassies and Consulates worldwide. </p>  <p>  The Passport Office in Cork is currently processing applications well within target turnaround times with renewal applications via Northern Ireland and Great Britain being processed within 10 days and non-renewals within 13 and 17 days respectively. Applications submitted at Ireland&rsquo;s network of Embassies and Consulates are being processed within 20 days. </p>  <p>  The public counter in Cork also continues to accept applications from all categories of applicant, by appointment. Where appropriate, this office can also facilitate the issuance of emergency passports.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to closely monitor the level of passport demand to ensure that all resources are effectively deployed. In order to manage seasonal demand and anticipated application increases, the Passport Service recruited 216 Temporary Clerical Officers this year. These Temporary Clerical Officers were appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork in accordance with application volumes allocated to each office. A total of 50 Temporary Clerical Officers were assigned to the Passport Office in Cork. </p>  <p>  Targeted overtime was also utilised across all Passport Offices to help reduce the impact of high application volumes on turnaround times. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, 12 Clerical Officers and 1 Executive Officer have joined the Cork Passport Office&rsquo;s permanent staff since the beginning of the year. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-04a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100400047#WRA02400"><p>The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning for Brexit has from the start included issues relating to the continued effective use of the UK landbridge. This is a priority for the Government given its importance in getting Irish products to market on continental Europe, in particular with regard to agri-food products. This is an important issue with regard to protecting the competitiveness of our producers and ensuring continued unhampered access to the EU Single Market.</p>  <p>  A Landbridge Project Group is chaired by my Department and involves all relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and the Marine, Department of Health, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. The Project Group has met four times to date.  </p>  <p>  Work on is being taken forward in two strands. The first is through the Article 50 negotiations. In the mandate provided to the European Commission by the EU27 in May 2017, it was agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement will take account of Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic situation, including the transit of goods (to and from Ireland via the UK).  The need to address this issue as part of the distinct strand of the negotiations on Irish specific issues was agreed between the EU and the UK in the Joint Progress report of December 2017. </p>  <p>  To this end, I welcome the UK&rsquo;s formal notification to the European Commission of its intention to join the Common Transit Convention. The UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Travel Convention will play an important role in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s access to other EU Member States via the UK landbridge.</p>  <p>  The second strand is our work with the European Commission and other affected Member States (Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden) with a view to preparing EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code. This work is intensifying and good progress is being made. </p>  <p>  Our work on the landbridge must also include the possibility of a no-deal or worse-case outcome. </p>  <p>  To this end, relevant Departments have now been tasked by the Government to roll out detailed Action Plans with a view to advancing, as appropriate, the mitigating measures which have been identified in the areas of their responsibility from the planning to the implementation phase.  In line with this approach, the Government has already approved a number of key Brexit preparedness measures focused on East-West trade which will also take account of the continued use of the landbridge.    </p></reply>

Acts of violence and discrimination based on religion or belief, committed in the name of religion or national security, whether by individuals, by groups or by states, must be challenged. </p>  <p>  Our commitment to promoting freedom of religion and belief is reaffirmed in the Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World, published in January 2015 and more recently in the Programme for Partnership Government. We work to advance this commitment at the EU, the UN Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly and through our bilateral contacts. I wish to stress that the promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. Ireland works closely with Human Rights Defenders to protect them and the work they do and to promote the value of civil society space.</p>  <p>  At the UN General Assembly we regularly support initiatives to protect against acts of persecution based on religion or belief, raising our concern for the continued discrimination, intimidation and systematic harassment of members of Muslim, Christian and Baha&rsquo;i communities, as well as those belonging to non-traditional religious or belief movements.  </p>  <p>  Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of religious minorities. During our Presidency of the European Council in 2013, Ireland played a key role in the development of the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief, which provide a framework for the promotion of this right in the EU&rsquo;s external human rights policy. In 2015, Ireland also pressed for the inclusion of a reference to the promotion of this right in the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019, which ensures that the EU will continue to engage on the issue of the promotion of freedom of religion and belief.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, including in the Irish Embassy in Ankara, which is also accredited to Pakistan, will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Pakistan, in close cooperation with the EU. If the Deputy is aware of any organisations representing the Ahmadiyya community in Ireland, I would ask him to encourage that organisation to make contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade directly. Officials in my Department would be happy to meet with such a group in order to discuss their situation in more detail.</p></reply>

Amongst other things, in Global Ireland the Government committed to publishing a White Paper on Ireland&rsquo;s International Development Cooperation and to delivering 0.7% of GNI to Overseas Development Assistance by 2030.</p>  <p>  The public consultation for the new international development policy concluded on Tuesday in Dublin.  </p>  <p>  Over 185 substantive written submissions were received from Irish people and non-governmental organisations, as well as UN and other international bodies.  Five well-attended public meetings were held, in Cork, Galway, Sligo, Limerick, and Dublin.  The intention is to publish the White Paper before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In developing the new policy, the intention is to further fine tune Ireland&rsquo;s international contribution to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Building on the reputation for quality work for which Irish Aid is recognised, the policy will enable Ireland to play its full part in helping address the challenges which the world will face in the decades ahead, including conflict prevention, climate change and gender equality. We will continue a focus on those left furthest behind and will reinforce our support for a rules-based multi-lateral system. The new policy will also assist Ireland in consolidating existing partnerships and in building new relationships. </p>  <p>  The new policy will inform an ambitious pathway to reaching the UN target of 0.7% GNI over the lifetime of the sustainable development goals.  However, a steady and phased approach is required if the focus on quality and on reaching the furthest behind is to be maintained as the Irish Aid programme expands.   </p></reply>

In particular the report provides credible findings that human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by members of the Burmese Military (Tatmadaw) and other security forces in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States. </p>  <p>  The IIFFM&rsquo;s report also finds that there is sufficient evidence of crimes committed in Rakhine State being so grave that they warrant a competent court to determine the liability for the crime of genocide of those in the Tatmadaw chain of command. </p>  <p>  The work of the IIFFM in investigating allegations, recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability. </p>  <p>  I have taken note of the recommendations and Ireland is actively engaging with our international partners in responding to its findings. </p>  <p>  One of the key issues we have focused on so far is the issue of accountability. At the recent 39th Session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland actively supported the creation of a resolution on Myanmar, proposed jointly by the EU and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which mandates a new impartial independent mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the most serious violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. This is an important step in facilitating fair and independent criminal proceedings for these crimes.</p>  <p>  The IIFFM report also makes a number of other recommendations. In particular, the report recommends the introduction of targeted sanctions against members of the Tatmadaw and Border Guard Police who have been accused of violations of international law. Ireland has actively engaged in the formation of the EU&rsquo;s position in the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s Conclusions on Myanmar, which were adopted on 26 February 2018. These Conclusions, which in some ways anticipated the outcome of the IIFFMM, provide for the imposition of targeted measures against certain persons from the Myanmar Armed Forces and Border Guard Police responsible for serious human rights violations and for the expansion of the existing arms embargo. A number of members of the Tatmadaw and Border Guards have been listed under these sanctions since the Conclusions were adopted in February. Ireland is actively engaging in further discussions in this regard in light of the findings of the IIFFM.</p>  <p>  Another of the key recommendations of the IIFFM relates to the question of repatriation. Ireland strongly supports the IIFFM&rsquo;s insistence that provisions be made for a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable means of return of the Rohingya to Rakhine State and for the introduction of measures that will enable them to sustain a reasonable livelihood. The question of citizenship is central in this regard and I call on the authorities of Myanmar comprehensively address this issue. </p>  <p>  Additionally, it is clear that the long-standing drivers of conflict in Myanmar need to be addressed. The IIFFM recognises that, the implementation of the findings of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State (The Annan Commission) provides a roadmap for sustainable and community-led peacebuilding in Rakhine State, and for the development of extremely impoverished regions there. Ireland has strongly and repeatedly supported the implementation of the report of the Advisory Commission&rsquo;s findings and will continue to do so. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor the situation and to work with our international partners to urge progress within Myanmar on these difficult issues and to pursue a resolution to this crisis that brings peace, reconciliation and prosperity for everybody in Myanmar.  In the meantime, Ireland will continue to support the provision of humanitarian aid to those in need.</p></reply>

An abstention is consistent with the position Ireland has taken on previous ICJ referral resolutions.</p>  <p>  The vote on this resolution was 95 in favour, 15 against, with 65 abstentions.</p>  <p>  It is now for the ICJ to consider the merits of the arguments put before it and I do not, therefore, intend to make any representations.</p></reply>

I have also underlined that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this request, and pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p></reply>

Yemen is the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis, with over twenty million people in need of assistance due to drought and the disruptions of war.  Three years of war have had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of human rights, international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life. </p>  <p>  I, and officials in my Department, have been monitoring the state of affairs in Yemen with growing anxiety, particularly in recent weeks as multiple reports of attacks affecting civilians have circulated. I remain deeply concerned by the level of violence in Yemen, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. I condemn in the strongest terms all actions which endanger civilians, including those attacks referenced by the Deputies. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department regularly convey to the Saudi Embassy in Dublin my strong concerns in relation to the situation in Yemen, and the impact the fighting is having on civilians. They also conveyed my condemnation of missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, which also have the potential to impact on civilians. My officials have also raised my concerns about civilians in Yemen with the Embassy of Iran. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also been to the fore in raising human rights issues in Yemen at the Human Rights Council (HRC). In Ireland&rsquo;s most recent Item 4 Statement (human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention) at the HRC session in September 2018, we expressed our particular concerns about &ldquo;the ongoing reports of attacks resulting in civilian casualties, and allegations of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Ireland has also supported the establishment of the establishing a Group of Eminent Experts (GEE) whose mandate is to carry out investigations into all alleged violations of human rights in Yemen. Last week, Ireland once again worked with a core group of countries at the HRC to bring forward a resolution to extend the mandate of this group, in order to allow more time for its work.</p>  <p>  I remain convinced that for a small country such as Ireland, raising issues of concern in multilateral fora can be the most effective way to multiply our influence. I have participated actively in discussions at EU level on this issue. There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia in relation to concerns about civilians in Yemen. My officials and I will continue to raise our concerns about the situation in Yemen in EU, UN and other international contexts, whenever opportunities arise.</p>  <p>  On the problems posed by arms transfers to conflict regions, Ireland&rsquo;s efforts are concentrated on universalisation and implementation of the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which has been signed and ratified by all EU Member States. The ATT is the first legally binding instrument to regulate the international trade in conventional weapons. States which sign up to the Treaty are prohibited from exporting arms to countries if they know those weapons will be used to commit gross violations of human rights. In addition, the EU&rsquo;s Common Position on Arms Exports contains 8 risk assessment criteria that all EU countries must apply to their licensing decisions for exports of military goods. At present, there is no consensus at EU level on an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia. </p>  <p>  Ireland has provided &euro;15.5 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance to Yemen since the conflict began in 2015. Of this, &euro;4 million was contributed this year alone.   Ireland also provides global funding to a number of organisations which are particularly active in Yemen including the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputies that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to urge stronger international action, and will press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, as well as respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.</p></reply>

While the rationale for the sanctions in question is fully understood, they have unfortunately and inadvertently had the effect of jeopardising a major employer in Ireland and, if a resolution is not found, will also lead to serious economic consequences elsewhere in Europe.</p>  <p>  There has been extensive engagement between the Government and the US authorities on this issue in recent months.  The Embassy in Washington DC is in regular, ongoing contact with the US administration, including with the US Treasury Department&rsquo;s Office for Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is responsible for administering and enforcing economic sanctions.   </p>  <p>  In addition, my officials based at Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation to the European Union in Brussels have engaged intensively on the issue, both with similarly affected EU Member States and with the European Commission.  My Department is also represented on the Inter-Departmental committee established to safeguard the future of the plant, which has met regularly in recent months.   </p>  <p>  I wrote to my US counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on the issue in July, and again last month, outlining the difficulties faced here in Ireland, and requesting a definitive resolution to the situation.  My colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Business and Innovation have also written to US Secretaries Mnuchin and Ross on the issue.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance also discussed the matter with Kevin Hassett, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, on his recent visit to Ireland.  Most recently, I raised the issue with US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan in the course of my meeting with him in New York on Friday last.</p>  <p>  There have also been ongoing contacts with the Irish management of the plant in the last number of months in order to understand the difficulties they are experiencing, and to seek their views on where a resolution might lie.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that OFAC recently announced the extension of the expiration of the licence for the plant in question for several weeks, until mid-November.  This is an encouraging sign, and one which I and my Government colleagues very much hope means we are moving closer to a resolution.  Notwithstanding this, we will remain intensively engaged on the issue so as to safeguard the future of the plant.  </p></reply>

I am particularly pleased that the report singles Ireland out as an example of best practice, as pioneers in the introduction of a plastic bag levy at the point of sale in 2002.</p>  <p>  The report highlights the vast human, social, environmental and economic cost of plastic pollution to the world.  </p>  <p>  Plastic pollution marks a major hindrance to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, which the world agreed to in 2015.  Ireland is no exception. Ireland&rsquo;s strong reliance on fisheries, agriculture and tourism for economic prosperity means that we must continue to be ambitious in addressing plastic pollution. </p>  <p>  I strongly support the UN Global Plastics Platform, which was launched last week at the UN General Assembly where Ireland was represented.  UN action will help to encourage stronger collective response to a shared problem. </p>  <p>  The European Plastics Strategy was launched in May 2018, including associated Plastics Directive. Delivery of the Plastics Strategy is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment. </p></reply>

The mandate of this group was to carry out investigations into all alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all warring parties in Yemen. The GEE presented its findings to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in a report published on 29 August 2018. The report strongly suggested that violations and crimes under international law have been perpetrated in Yemen since 2014. However the report also noted the limited time, access and resources that the experts had in order to carry out their work and that many incidents and alleged violations committed by all parties have not yet been fully documented.</p>  <p>  Given the gravity of the situation in Yemen, Ireland and our core group partners believed it was important to give the Group of Eminent Experts more time to fully examine the conflict and to ensure that their conclusions comprehensively reflect the conduct of all parties in future reporting.  </p>  <p>  In light of this, Ireland once again worked with a core group of countries to bring forward a resolution which sought to extend the mandate of the GEE, in order to allow the group more time to continue its vital work. Last week, although there was unfortunately not full consensus on the issue, the Human Rights Council voted in favour of extending the mandate of the Group of Eminent Experts for a further period of one year, and requested that the Group submit a comprehensive written report to the High Commissioner for presentation next September, at the forty-second session of the Council.</p></reply>

I am also aware of the specific case referred to by the Deputy, of a Baha&rsquo;i individual who has been sentenced to death by the Houthi de facto authorities. While we do not have all the details of the case, I am concerned that this person appears to have been sentenced on the basis of his religious beliefs. Ireland calls on all parties in Yemen to immediately release all Baha&rsquo;i detained due to their religious belief, and to cease the harassment to which they are subjected.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are. The promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief is and will continue to be a priority for Ireland&rsquo;s engagement on human rights issues. Ireland is also unequivocal in our position regarding the universal abolition of the death penalty. Most recently, at the 39th session of the UN Human Rights Council, we reaffirmed our strong opposition to capital punishment in all circumstances and for all cases, expressing our deep concern at its continued use by States. </p>  <p> Ireland has regularly raised our concern regarding the persecution of the Baha&rsquo;i at the Human Rights Council and the United Nations General Assembly. Most recently, Ireland raised concerns with regards to the persecution of the Baha&rsquo;i at the 37th session of the Human Rights Council in March 2018 during the interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief.</p>  <p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia is also accredited to Yemen, the Irish Government does not have any contact with the Houthi de facto authorities, against whom the accusations have been made of the persecution of the Baha&rsquo;i community. Unfortunately, the Government is not in a position to make representations to non-state actors in Yemen in relation to their actions. We have therefore focused our efforts on this issue in multilateral fora, to increase international awareness of the issue. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation closely, and will remain in contact with representatives of the Baha&rsquo;i community in Ireland, who are represented on the Department of Foreign Affairs Committee on Human Rights, and with whom they have discussed the situation of Baha&rsquo;i in Yemen, and </p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to building on the progress made to establish the comprehensive institutional framework for dealing with the past that is provided for under the 2014 Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>  Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland to deal with the legacy of the Troubles.  Over the last 18 months, I have engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with all of the political parties to support a way forward on the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies.  </p>  <p>  I have also consistently emphasised in these discussions the need to ensure proper resourcing of legacy inquests in Northern Ireland, and I continue to raise this matter, seeking urgent progress.</p>  <p>  Secretary of State Bradley and I are agreed on the imperative of moving ahead with the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework.</p>  <p>  On 11 May, I welcomed the launch of a public consultation by the British Government on their draft legislation to establish the legacy bodies provided for in the Stormont House Agreement as an important step forward. </p>  <p>  While that consultation is about UK legislation to establish the institutions, legislation will also be required in this jurisdiction to provide for cooperation with the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies.  The drafting of legislative proposals for consideration by the Government and Oireachtas is advancing, led by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The Historical Investigation Unit (HIU) is one of the institutions provided for as part of the legacy framework of the Stormont House Agreement.  The HIU will take forward outstanding investigations into Troubles-related deaths in Northern Ireland, from the Historical Enquiries Team process and the historical investigations of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. The HIU was provided for under the Stormont House Agreement in response to concerns about shortcomings with the investigation of outstanding Troubles-related deaths, which are unique to Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  There is no provision under the Stormont House Agreement for a similar body in this jurisdiction. The investigation of crime, including unresolved, Troubles-related crimes, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of all Garda resources, including personnel. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Charles Flanagan T.D., has confirmed to this House that in circumstances where historic, Troubles-related offences have not been resolved, the investigations remain open and the Garda Authorities will and do follow up fully on any new evidence or information that becomes available to them, whether that comes from the public, from other police services or from their own investigations. </p>  <p>  The Government has also committed to putting in place the necessary additional provisions for the HIU to co-operate with relevant authorities in this jurisdiction. As I have noted, the drafting of legislative proposals for consideration by the Government and Oireachtas in this regard is advancing, led by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Comprehensive progress on legacy issues from the Troubles is crucial in order to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors, and to contribute to broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process.  The Government will continue to engage in support of that, consistent with our role and responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

We have provided more than &euro;10 million in funding to Colombia since 2007 to protect human rights, prevent conflict, build peace, and support livelihoods for rural populations, including women.</p>  <p>  A particular focus for funding last year was supporting the implementation of the Peace Agreements, as well as developing and facilitating lesson-sharing programmes between Colombia and Ireland, building on our own experience of conflict and amounting to more than &euro;2.3 million.  </p>  <p>  Ireland was a founding member of the EU Trust Fund for Colombia, and continues to provide funding to the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in their work to support the implementation of the peace accords. </p>  <p>  While financial contributions are important, also of value is the sharing of our experience of peacebuilding.  One of the most important lessons we have learnt in twenty years of implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is how long it takes to build peace, and that it is not a linear process.  There have been many periods where the process hit what seemed like unsurmountable obstacles.  Nonetheless, we have also seen the importance of the slow and painstaking building up of trust between communities, enabling reconciliation, and embedding a culture of peace.</p>  <p>  We support the full implementation of the peace accords in Colombia to ensure a more peaceful future for all Colombians.  We have stressed our continued support for the peace process to the government of President Iv&aacute;n Duque, which recently took office, and have outlined that we see our support to Colombia as a long term commitment.  The Taoiseach met with President Duque in New York last week and reiterated this commitment.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working with the Government of Colombia and with our EU partners to ensure a coordinated and effective approach that best supports the implementation of the peace accords.  I am pleased that former T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore will continue in his role as EU Special Envoy to the Peace Process for a further year, and my Department will continue to support him in this work. </p>  <p>  I also look forward to the opening of our new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; early next year.  Having a permanent diplomatic presence on the ground will further enable us to monitor the status of the peace accords closely and to fulfil our commitment to the Government and people of Colombia. </p></reply>

The Government remains focused on work in the negotiations to conclude a withdrawal agreement.</p><p>On 18 July I presented a detailed Memorandum to the Government on Brexit Preparedness and Contingency Planning. The Memorandum included elements aimed at moving from planning to implementation in a number of key areas and the Government requested detailed follow-up proposals, including in regard to the recruitment of customs officers and staff responsible for sanitary and phytosanitary checks. </p><p>Subsequently, at its meeting of 18 September the Government agreed key steps including the necessary recruitment for 2019 of customs officials and staff responsible for SPS and health checks that may be necessary at ports and airports on an East West basis.</p><p>On 19 July, the European Commission published a paper on <i>Preparing for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 30 March 2019</i>.  The European Commission has offered guidance regarding potential consequences resulting from various Brexit scenarios, and where planning is focused on areas of exclusive EU or mixed competence, the role of the Commission will be of great importance and we continue to engage actively with the Commission on this work.  This includes matters relating to aviation.  </p><p>In areas of domestic action, the focus is on the necessary responses led by Government Departments and Agencies, as well as in areas where the preparedness response is driven primarily by stakeholders in individual sectors of the economy but with appropriate support from Government. Preparation and planning is ongoing across Government to address a range of Brexit scenarios, including a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; scenario, and Departments and agencies continue to develop and implement, as appropriate, Brexit preparedness and contingency planning in their areas of responsibility. </p><p>All of this work is in addition to measures that have already been put in place to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector.  Capital expenditure of &euro;116bn over the coming decade under Project Ireland 2040 will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead. There was also increased funding provided to my Department in Budget 2018 for the opening of six new diplomatic missions. A further seven new Missions will be opened as part of the next phase of expanding Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint. These thirteen new Missions will be located in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Oceania and will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets.</p><p>Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. In total 51 reports analysing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments. All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Detailed preparedness and contingency planning is being carried forward by Government Departments across the full range of sectors expected to be impacted by Brexit. In the case of aviation, preparation and planning includes future air connectivity with the UK following Brexit. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is preparing a Brexit Action Plan as well as continuing its contingency planning for a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; UK exit from the EU. </p><p>It is also important that the aviation industry takes steps to prepare for Brexit and that industry stakeholders undertake contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations. Stakeholders should refer to the European Commission&rsquo;s published Notices to Stakeholders in the field of air transport, aviation safety and aviation security. </p><p>There are ongoing consultations and meetings between my officials, other Government Departments and agencies, and other public and private key stakeholders in order to continue to plan for and mitigate the risks associated with Brexit across the range of sectoral areas. </p></reply>

I have also prioritised this issue in my own engagements with the US Administration and Congress.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has been active on the issue and has, since his appointment, travelled to Washington, D.C., on ten separate occasions for meetings with key contacts.</p><p>In addition, our Embassy in Washington, D.C., continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the Administration and with a wide range of contacts on Capitol Hill. </p><p>The Embassy, as well as our six Consulates across the United States, also work closely with Irish immigration centres, which support the needs of Irish citizens in the United States, including undocumented Irish citizens.  My colleague Minister of State Ciar&aacute;n Cannon met with the New York and Philadelphia-based Irish Centers just last week in New York.  <i></i></p><p>Through these many high-level contacts and discussions, the Government continues to explore a number of different options, including the possibility of a reciprocal agreement covering the undocumented Irish in the US, on the one hand, and US citizens looking to move to Ireland, on the other. </p><p>This remains a very challenging issue, however, and I do not want to raise expectations.  Immigration reform has been a sensitive and divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with an issue which directly affects over 11 million people.  </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that both the Taoiseach and I, together with our Government colleagues, Special Envoy Deputy Deasy, and our Embassy in Washington, D.C., will continue to prioritise this issue, mindful of its importance to the thousands of undocumented and to their families in Ireland.

His visit came ten years after his last visit in 2008 and gave us a valuable opportunity to discuss a number of issues relating to the Middle East Peace Process and our bilateral relations with Palestine.</p>  <p>  After the official welcome at the Dublin airport on 22 September, President Abbas and his delegation proceeded to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in to meet with President Higgins. Following this the Taoiseach and I held a substantive and useful meeting with President Abbas at Farmleigh. I also hosted a working dinner for the President and his delegation that evening. Our discussions were enhanced by the presence of other senior Palestinian leaders, including Saeb Erekat, Chief Negotiator and Secretary General of the PLO; Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Ziad Abu-Amr; Foreign Minister Riad Malki; and others.  </p>  <p>  Our discussions covered a range of issues, opening with Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing support for the Palestinian people, including practical support in the form of bilateral assistance. We discussed the Middle East Peace Process, both in terms of the issues arising from the occupation, and the international environment and prospects for any political initiative. We shared concerns about increasing illegal settlements and discussed the threatened demolition of the village of Khan Al Ahmar in particular. We also spoke about the situation in Gaza and the prospects for Palestinian reconciliation. </p>  <p>  We discussed the funding crisis facing UNRWA and I was able to take the opportunity to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s support for UNRWA with the announcement of an additional &euro;1 million in Irish Aid funding, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total funding to UNRWA to &euro;7 million this year, the highest it has ever been. I underlined the Government&rsquo;s strong support for the Agency and the essential work it is carrying out under difficult conditions. </p>  <p>  During the meeting with the Taoiseach, the issue of human rights in Palestine was raised, in particular in relation to the Christian minority, women and LGBT persons in Palestine. </p>  <p>  President Abbas and his colleagues expressed their strong hope that Ireland would soon recognise the State of Palestine. I explained the Government&rsquo;s position, our consistent support for the achievement of a fully sovereign Palestinian state, and my continuing assessment of whether and when formal recognition by Ireland could be most helpful. </p>  <p>  In giving consideration to what more we could do to support the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority in the current deteriorating situation, I also raised the idea of Ireland hosting an informal meeting of a small number of Arab and European Ministers with Palestinian representatives, to reflect privately on how to advance the cause of peace. We are working to develop this concept, in consultation with partners, over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

I made my views clear in my public statement<b></b>on 1 September and reiterated them during my speech before the UN General Assembly last week, where I stated that I greatly regretted recent cuts to UNRWA&rsquo;s funding by the US, and called on those in power to reconsider the consequence of their decisions. I believe that this move is dangerous and will only have a negative effect on the Middle East region. I have also explicitly expressed my concern in direct contacts with the US administration.</p><p>I met with UNRWA&rsquo;s Commissioner General, Pierre Kr&auml;henb&uuml;hl in January, and saw for myself the services provided by UNRWA both in the West Bank and in Gaza. I am very conscious of how essential the Agency&rsquo;s work is, in terms of delivering core services, especially in education and health. These services are often delivered in the most challenging of circumstances, especially in Gaza.  </p><p>The services that UNRWA provides are necessary, and will remain necessary, until a durable solution to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict can be negotiated that meets the needs of both parties and resolves all final status issues.</p><p>I was delighted to use the opportunity of the visit by President Abbas to Ireland last month to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s support for UNRWA, including by announcing an additional &euro;1 million in Irish Aid funding, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total funding to UNRWA to &euro;7 million this year, an increase of &euro;1.5m on 2017, and the highest it has ever been.</p><p>We are far from alone in our support for UNRWA.  At a Ministerial meeting in New York last week to discuss UNRWA, I was gratified by the strong political support for the Agency, its mandate and staff, and the critical services it provides to Palestine refugees. An additional US$122 million for UNRWA was pledged at the New York meeting. This included an additional &euro;40 million from the European Commission, bringing its overall contribution to UNRWA's activities in 2018 to &euro;146 million. In fact for the three years 2016, 2017 and 2018, the total contribution to UNRWA of the EU and its Member States combined has reached approximately &euro;1.2 billion.</p><p>Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue our assistance to the Palestinian people, including our support to UNRWA's services, while we will also continue our efforts to reach a two-state solution to the conflict. </p></reply>

The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport. These include a postal application system, an online passport application service, in person counter application facilities in Dublin and Cork and the network of Irish Missions worldwide.</p>  <p>  The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently ahead of target at 10 working days.  </p>  <p>  Other types of application, which are generally submitted through Passport Express, such as first time applications or applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports are also ahead of target at 15 working days. The target turnaround times for these channels are 15 working days and 20 working days respectively.</p>  <p>  The current turnaround time for applications made via the online passport application service is also ahead of target at 8 working days plus postage, 2 days ahead of the target of 10 working days. I would urge applicants wishing to renew their passports, whether residing in Ireland or overseas, to avail of the online passport application service where possible. </p>  <p>  At present, the online passport application service accommodates adult passport renewal applications and passport card applications. The Passport Service is currently in the process of rolling out a similar service for the renewal of children&rsquo;s passports. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is processing just over 22,000 passport applications at present. These applications are going through the normal checking, processing and security stages. </p>  <p>  Measures taken by the Passport Service this year to manage increasing passport demand included the recruitment of Temporary Clerical Officers and the use of targeted overtime. The Passport Service plans to commence recruitment for next year&rsquo;s intake Temporary Clerical Officers next month so that the appropriate level temporary staff are trained and in place early next year. </p></reply>

The conflict, which is now in its eighth year, has cost the lives of well over 400,000 people. Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, over 6 million people are internally displaced, and a further 5.6 million people have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;116 million in humanitarian assistance to the Syria crisis, making this Ireland&rsquo;s largest contribution to a single crisis in recent years. At the 2018 Brussels Donor conference, Ireland pledged to contribute a further &euro;25 million in 2018, and over &euro;23 million of this has been disbursed so far.  Irish funding has supported the work of UN, Red Cross/ Red Crescent and established NGO partners. Ireland&rsquo;s Syria funding is not generally programmed in the form of direct funding to local Syrian NGOs, and thus the Government has not funded the group that the Deputy refers to. </p>  <p>  The organisation to which the Deputy refers is a volunteer search and rescue organisation that operates in opposition-held areas. Its members have taken upon themselves the extremely hazardous work of saving lives in the most challenging and dangerous circumstances. This work has been acknowledged and supported by many EU member states.</p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the funding decisions of another EU Member State. However, I understand that the Government of the Netherlands has made clear that its decision to end its funding to this group, which will occur at the end of this year, does not represent a negative judgement on their work. It is rather a reaction to the shifting nature of the Syria conflict, and a changing assessment of where the greatest needs are expected to lie. </p>  <p>  The protection of civilians is an obligation on all parties to conflicts, and I call on all parties to the fighting in Syria to take the necessary steps to ensure that civilians are not harmed, especially around Idlib, where there are particularly acute concerns. I also take this opportunity to reiterate my call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, respect for de-escalation agreements and full humanitarian access to all Syrians in need. </p></reply>

Other EU partners are also very active on this issue. Fields for EU action include political support for the peace process, action on the ground to mitigate the damaging effects of the occupation, and humanitarian assistance in Gaza and other areas.

The implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is a priority for the Government, as highlighted in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government. </p>  <p>  I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department. </p>  <p>  I met with Justice for the Forgotten in April to hear their views and update them on the Government&rsquo;s continuing engagement on legacy issues, including with the British Government on the D&aacute;il motions. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality met with Justice for the Forgotten on 4 July to hear their further views on the implementation of the legacy framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement.  My Department also facilitated an engagement on 29 August in Dublin for the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Victims and Survivors, Judith Thompson, to hear the views of victims and survivors in this jurisdiction, including the families affected by the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other attacks, in the context of the British Government&rsquo;s ongoing consultation on draft UK legislation to establish the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies.</p>  <p>  In relation to the D&aacute;il motions, I have consistently underlined to the British Government that the motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin and Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p></reply>

My Department has from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management, particularly in relation to Irish Aid public outreach activities.</p><p>In 2018, DHR Communications has been contracted via separate competitive tendering processes to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer Africa Day-related events.  </p><p>The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year, including the annual SCMF student competition. This typically involves the following activities:  </p><p>- Convening national and regional information workshops; </p><p>- Managing and administering the application process;</p><p>- Organising the judging process</p><p>- Providing detailed feedback to all applicants; </p><p>- Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;</p><p>- Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  </p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties at this stage account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund. This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  </p><p>In relation to Africa Day 2018, DHR was engaged to plan, manage and execute a national flagship event as hosted by my Department at the Farmleigh Estate on Sunday 27 May. DHR worked to raise public awareness of the event, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This public awareness work was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s Communications Unit.</p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs involved. This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.</p><p>Details of project management, logistics and event management-related expenditure to date during 2018 for the Simon Cumbers Media Fund and Africa Day are as follows:</p><p><b>Project Management, Logistics and Event Management Expenditure 2018</b><table><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Supplier</th><th>Breakdown by Month</th><th>Cost to Date in 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Simon Cumbers Media Fund</td><td>DHR  Communications</td><td>Jan</td><td>2,631</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Feb</td><td>4,305</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Mar</td><td>3,715</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>April</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>May</td><td>19,565</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>June</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>July</td><td>11,187</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Aug</td><td>4,380.49</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Sept</td><td>4,063.51</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>49,847</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Africa Day 2018</td><td>DHR Communications</td><td>Jan</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Feb</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Mar</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>April</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>May</td><td>98,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>June</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>July</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Aug</td><td>56,226</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Sept</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>154,226</td></tr></table></p></reply>

A key element of our programme is directed towards strengthening the ability of the Palestinian Authority to meet those needs. Enabling Palestinians to build institutions and provide essential public services is critical to laying the foundations for a future Palestinian State. </p>  <p>  Ireland is one of five partners working directly with the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Education and Higher Education to support them in delivering their Education Development Strategic Plan.  Funding of &euro;2.5 million will be provided this year to support the Ministry in providing better quality education services to more Palestinian children, which is crucial to Palestine&rsquo;s long-term economic viability.</p>  <p>  The provision of scholarship opportunities for Palestinian students to study in Ireland is also an important dimension of our engagement. In January this year, the T&aacute;naiste announced an increase of &euro;200,000 in scholarship funding for Palestinian students. This is a first step towards scaling up a scholarship programme for Palestinian students over the next five years.</p>  <p>  Ireland also works to assist the Palestinian Authority in delivering essential public services in the West Bank and Gaza through a mechanism overseen by the European Commission, known as PEGASE. Our support, which will amount to &euro;0.275 million in 2018, has been focused on the social development sector, enabling continued service delivery in the vital areas of health, education and social services. This support helps to strengthen the Authority&rsquo;s ability to meet the needs of the most vulnerable Palestinian households. </p>  <p>  Significant funding is also given to the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) so that they can continue to provide basic services such as food aid, education and health to some 5.3 million Palestine refugees.  To date in 2018, Ireland has provided funding totalling &euro;7 million for UNRWA&rsquo;s Programme Budget and Emergency Appeals in Gaza and Syria. This is an increase of &euro;1.5 million on the 2017 allocation, making this year&rsquo;s contribution Ireland&rsquo;s highest ever.</p>  <p>  Ireland will also provide support in 2018 to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), the West Bank Protection Consortium and civil society organisations working to promote human rights and peacebuilding. In addition, preliminary work is underway to allow for a significant capital project, providing solar power to the NGEST water treatment plant in Gaza, to move to construction during 2019.</p></reply>

A number of Palestinian and Israeli organisations who monitor human rights violations and promote greater accountability by both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities receive Irish funds &ndash; a total of &euro;645,000 will be provided to these organisations in 2018. </p>  <p>  In 2017, Ireland joined the European Commission-led West Bank Protection Consortium, underlining our commitment to reducing the vulnerability of Palestinian communities living in Area C of the West Bank. The Consortium has played a leading role in supporting threatened communities and coordinating the provision of essential services, including material assistance and legal aid. Funding of &euro;200,000 was provided to the Consortium in 2018. A further &euro;75,000 will be provided this year to support the Israeli-Palestinian NGO, COMET-ME, which provides potable water and solar power to isolated communities at risk in the West Bank. </p>  <p>  Ireland also supports initiatives in the area of peacebuilding, aimed in particular at sharing lessons and inspiration from the Northern Ireland peace process. A total of &euro;220,000 will be provided to organisations working in Israel and Palestine for peacebuilding programmes in 2018. </p>  <p>  In addition, two of Ireland&rsquo;s key NGO partners, Tr&oacute;caire and Christian Aid, allocate a portion of their overall Irish Aid funding for work with Palestinian and Israeli civil society organisations which are also involved in a range of humanitarian, development and peace building programmes. A total of over &euro;1 million has been allocated for these programmes in 2018.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to continuing support to civil society organisations as part of our overall programme of support to the Palestinian people. Further funding levels will be considered in the context of the overall budget allocation available to the overseas development programme in 2019. </p></reply>

The Embassy network is an invaluable asset for trade promotion in locations with limited or no state agency presence. In addition to economic and public diplomacy, the Department&rsquo;s officers overseas and our mission attach&eacute;s undertake essential work in government-to-government relations across a range of issues including market access, regulatory compliance, visas, phyto-sanitary issues, DTAS and a host of other activities.</p><p>The Embassy network &ndash; comprising more than 80 Embassies or Consulates - plays a crucial role in supporting Irish businesses to grow overseas; in promoting our wider trade interests including through EU and WTO regulation; in addressing market access issues; and in supporting Ministerial visits and trade missions, as part of Team Ireland. </p><p>There are 30 Enterprise Ireland international locations covering more than 60 countries, alongside 21 IDA international locations covering more than 55 countries and 14 Tourism Ireland international locations covering 23 markets.  These are supported by a range of other individuals including pathfinders and commercial attach&eacute;s.</p><p>Taken together, Irish government representatives overseas form Team Ireland.  After the very successful inaugural Team Ireland Conference last November, the Government has committed in <i>Global Ireland</i>to the Team Ireland approach and to holding an annual conference.  As part of the implementation of <i>Global Ireland</i>and follow up from the Team Ireland Conference, discussions are ongoing about how to ensure that Team Ireland delivers on our ambitions to double our global impact.</p><p>At the market level, Team Ireland meets in the form of the Local Market Team, led by the Head of Mission.  The Local Market Team is tasked with ensuring that we can best exploit opportunities in market.  As set out in our trade strategy, <i>Ireland Connected</i>, we are pursuing two key objectives, namely market diversification and strengthening our presence in our traditional markets.  </p><p>Strengthening and diversifying our alliances within the EU has assumed renewed importance with Brexit. Work to intensify alliance-building is ongoing, building on Ireland&rsquo;s strong level of engagement with a range of EU Member States across policy areas of key national concern.  </p><p>We also greatly value our trading relationship with the UK which is worth approximately &euro;65 billion p.a. and supports 400,000 jobs almost equally divided across the UK and Ireland.  Our Embassy in London and Consulate in Edinburgh work in conjunction with the State Agencies to promote and develop this relationship and will continue to do so.  </p><p>Advancing Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, education and investment objectives through economic diplomacy and related activities is at the forefront of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and is reflected in our approach to engaging with global challenges as set out in <i>Global Ireland</i>. </p><p>Underscoring the Government&rsquo;s global vision for Ireland and ensuring that our economy is resilient through market diversification, six new Missions will have been opened by early 2019 and a further seven will be opened from 2019 as part of the next phase of expanding Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint. These thirteen new Missions will be located in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Oceania and will contribute to helping develop new markets for Ireland&rsquo;s exports.  One of these new Missions is a Consulate in Cardiff which will also add to our footprint in the UK.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance programme is sharply focused on delivering our goals of reducing poverty and hunger, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth and building more equitable and better systems of governance.  Last month, the Overseas Development Institute, a leading think tank, found that Ireland&rsquo;s development programme was the most efficient in the world at targeting those in extreme poverty. </p>  <p>  A key principle underpinning Irish development cooperation is that it should remain untied - that is, not conditional on acquiring goods and services from Ireland.  This is regularly positively remarked upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee in their regular assessments of Ireland&rsquo;s international development cooperation and humanitarian programmes.</p>  <p>  Funding for multilateral organisations is kept under regular review by my Department, to ensure that it is targeted effectively, and channelled through partners who can contribute most effectively to delivering agreed priorities. In this way, Ireland is playing a strong role in supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.  </p>  <p>  Throughout, the ability of these funding channels to reach the poorest and most fragile countries and regions in the world, and deliver real results on the ground, is at the forefront of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement. Untying aid &ndash; removing the legal and regulatory barriers to open competition for aid-funded procurement &ndash; increases aid effectiveness by reducing transaction costs and improving the ability of partner countries to set their own course. Ireland is leading the way in this by making its bilateral Official Development Assistance 100% untied. </p>  <p>  For example, Ireland has been to the forefront in encouraging the EU and its Member States to untie more of their aid. Progress is being made. The proportion of EU and Member State aid that is untied now stands at over 80%. The European Commission has increased its share of untied aid from 48% in 2010 to 72% in 2016. We will continue to encourage further progress in that regard and maintain our international record of keeping our ODA 100% untied.  </p></reply>

We believe it is a transformative driver for stability and peace, and that it will enhance stability, political reform and economic growth. Providing the countries of the Western Balkans with a credible membership perspective is essential. Both the Taoiseach and Minister McEntee made this point when attending the EU-Western Balkans Summit on 17 May, and Minister McEntee re-iterated our support for enlargement at the June GAC prior to the issuing of Council Conclusions on Enlargement.</p>  <p>  We share the EU&rsquo;s view that considerable work remains to be done in all countries before accession can occur. Conditionality cannot be compromised and all criteria must be met. Comprehensive reforms are needed in crucial areas in each country, most notably on the rule of law, fundamental rights and good governance. Economic reform also requires progress. While we firmly support the European perspective of the six Western Balkan countries, Ireland has been clear that all benchmarks and criteria, particularly those relating to Chapters 23 and 24 of the acquis, which deal with issues relating to the rule of law, must be met before accession can be agreed. We are also clear that the EU cannot import instability; the six Western Balkan states must resolve all bilateral issues before they can become members of the EU.</p>  <p>  Equally, we believe it is important that the candidate and potential candidate countries are supported and rewarded as they make progress on their respective European paths. For this reason, we support the increasing of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Funding (IPA) in the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework. Ireland also gives annual funding to the Regional Cooperation Council, which supports regional cooperation and connectivity across the Western Balkans. In addition, officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassies accredited to the region are working to strengthen our already warm bilateral relations with the accession countries, with Minister McEntee visiting Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina for various high-level meetings, including with their respective Foreign Ministers, earlier this year. These efforts reflect the increased importance that successive EU Presidencies are placing on the European perspective of the Western Balkans.</p>  <p>  With regard to Turkey, Ireland has, together with our EU partners, expressed its serious concerns regarding the situation with respect to human rights, freedom of expression, rule of law, and democracy in the country. The EU still considers Turkey as a &lsquo;key partner&rsquo;, and it formally remains a candidate for EU membership, but given the current circumstances, the June 2018 Council conclusions on Enlargement noted that Turkey has been moving further away from the European Union, stating that accession negotiations have effectively come to a standstill and that no further chapters can be considered for opening or closing at this point in time. Neither is any further work towards the modernisation of the EU-Turkey Customs Union foreseen. Ireland supports this position and has stated that this situation will not change until Turkey begins to re-engage constructively with the Council of Europe and the EU, as we have urged them to do.</p></reply>

Irish officials continually coordinate with implementing partners and beneficiaries to ensure that Irish development assistance continues to have transformative impacts and, where possible, benefits from the network effects of collective, coordinated actions. </p><p>The area of greatest Irish concentration is Sub-Saharan Africa, where we direct assistance to the poorest communities, particularly but not exclusively in Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  Ireland also engages in Vietnam and neighbouring countries. </p><p>Our Embassy network coordinates with national and local governments on the design of development policies and strategies, and works with other bilateral donors in coordination structures in country to ensure that there is maximum collective impact.  These contacts also ensure that each bilateral donor acts in complementarity, with an eye to where each has comparative advantage.  In addition, these coordination structures allow all those involved to ensure effective implementation against agreed benchmarks. </p><p>In Ireland, we support coordination mechanisms among Irish NGOs and missionary organisations to maximise impact in their countries of activity.</p><p>We engage with UN and multilateral agencies whose core mission and objectives are closely aligned to Ireland&rsquo;s aid priorities, allowing us to work with and support vulnerable communities across most developing countries.  Programmes in receipt of funding are subject to regular internal and external monitoring and evaluation to ensure that the intended objectives and goals are being achieved - for example using the <i>Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network</i>(MOPAN) evaluations which every year focus on a number of multilateral organisations. </p><p>Ireland also plays a strong role in the relevant management structures of our multilateral partners, for example as Board Members of UNDP and UNFPA this year. In addition, we use our Embassy network, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, to monitor the work of multilateral partners on the ground and ensure that aid reaches the targeted population.  </p><p>In addition to development assistance, Ireland leads in humanitarian response, including to the ongoing Syria crisis and also to the situation in the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as to emergencies as they arise. We coordinate with the United Nations system, country governments and international partners to ensure the most effective collective actions to reduce suffering. In this regard, Ireland has this year taken the chair of the donor support group which supports the Office of the UN Humanitarian Coordinator (OCHA).</p></reply>

These groups continue to launch attacks and commit grave human rights violations against civilian populations, particularly women and girls. The Government consistently condemns their brutal actions.  Ireland continues to work with EU and UN partners to promote peace and security in the affected areas, and to coordinate our humanitarian responses so that those affected can be most effectively protected and assisted.  </p><p>Ireland and the EU are strong and consistent supporters of the work to build peace and stability in both the Lake Chad region and Somalia.  With international support, the Nigerian Government and regional security forces have continued to make progress in the fight against Boko Haram. The EU has contributed up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, where Nigeria and its neighbouring countries promote regional security.</p><p>The EU also provides considerable funding to AMISOM, the African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia, to combat the serious threat posed by Al-Shabaab and support the establishment of Somalia&rsquo;s government institutions. The EU provides further support to capacity building operations in the areas of maritime law enforcement and military training.</p><p>We are working with EU and UN partners to implement a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of radicalisation in both regions.

In line with our commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, our aid programme is sharply focused on delivering our goals of reducing poverty and hunger, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth and building more equitable and better systems of governance. </p><p>The Irish Aid Annual Report 2017, published on 2 October last, indicates that last year Irish bilateral assistance reached 87 of the world&rsquo;s under developed countries and a total of 143 countries received Irish support channelled through the multilateral system. A full list of all of the countries and multilateral agencies receiving ODA from Ireland in the annual report, which is available at: <i> </i></p><p>Irish assistance is given in support of countries development needs, typically in response to their poverty reduction strategies, and through the provision of humanitarian assistance in response to emergencies and protracted crises.  Sub-Saharan Africa remains our priority focus, where we direct assistance to the poorest communities, delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world poorest and most vulnerable people in the areas of basic health, education, agriculture, and food production. This focus is reflected in the adjudication last month by the Overseas Development Institute that Irish Aid is the world&rsquo;s most efficient donor at targeting extreme poverty.</p><p>We have a particularly strategic input into poverty reduction in those countries in Africa where we have a resident embassy - Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Tanzania Uganda, Zambia - allowing Ireland to play a key role in their long-term development.  A similar strategic role is played by the Embassy to Vietnam.  Smaller more focused programs are delivered in countries and territories such as Zimbabwe, South Africa, Liberia, Kenya and Palestine.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is delivered through a wide range of partners and channels, including partner government systems, Irish and international Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and missionary organisations, and UN and other multilateral agencies and organisations.

Tens of thousands of children are recruited and used as soldiers in conflicts around the world. Since 2002, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has issued an annual report on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups &ndash; both state and non-state &ndash; that recruit and use children. The most recent report, published in May 2018, indicated that children continue to be disproportionately affected by armed conflict in many country situations. The report also noted that in 2017, there was a large increase in the number of violations compared with the number reported for 2016. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and use of children as soldiers is explicitly prohibited under international humanitarian law and human rights law. In 1999, the UN Security Council passed its first Resolution, UNSCR 1261, on the impact of armed conflict on children and condemned violations in that context. In the same year, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child entered into force. Article 22 of the Charter sets out a prohibition on the recruitment and direct participation in hostilities of any person under the age of 18 years.</p>  <p>  Ever since, the Security Council has established important tools to strengthen child protection and to strengthen implementation of international standards, including the position of UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict who investigates and develops best practices to address the recruitment and use of child soldiers.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the eradication of the recruitment and use of child soldiers is highlighted in our Policy for International Development, &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo;. In addition to the focus in our development programmes on addressing the socio-economic causes which can lead to conflict, and the recruitment of child soldiers, Ireland also supports more targeted interventions by working with organizations such as UNICEF, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and institutions such as the International Criminal Court.</p></reply>

This is not dissimilar from our own peace process.</p>  <p>  For over a year, the United States Administration has been actively exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement. This is welcome, and I have met with and spoken to the US team on a number of occasions to encourage their work, and to underline the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused.  </p>  <p>  What is needed now is the resumption of direct talks, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace. I hope that the US peace plan, when it emerges, will provide a fair and workable basis for such talks to resume. I understand that the Palestinian leadership has concerns in relation to what a US proposal may contain. And I have been clear in my conversations with the US that a peace plan cannot work without Palestinian acceptance. In that regard, I have also urged President Abbas to keep an open mind on the US plans. </p>  <p>  I have also urged the EU to encourage and engage with a US initiative, provided it meets the parameters for a fair and successful resolution of the conflict. But I have also emphasised the need for the EU to continue our own work to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two-state solution, to which the EU remains firmly committed, can be achieved.</p>  <p>  At EU level, issues relating to the Israel-Palestine conflict are regularly discussed at both Ministerial and official level. In the last year, the members of the Foreign Affairs Council have held meetings on the margins of the Council with Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Abbas, and the group of Arab Foreign Ministers, as well as discussing the situation in Gaza specifically at their meeting in May. The Peace Process was discussed most recently by EU Foreign Ministers at the informal Foreign Affairs Council in August. There we considered how the EU can productively engage, and better use, all the levers at our disposal to influence the parties to the conflict. We must ensure that the EU&rsquo;s support for the region is focused on delivery of the two-state solution. </p>  <p>  Last month, the Council appointed a new EU Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process, Dutch diplomat Susanna Terstal, who will continue the work of her predecessors, engaging with partners to strengthen the peace process. </p>  <p>  The situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territory will remain high on my agenda.</p></reply>

Double taxation can potentially arise because Irish inheritance tax is based on the country of residence of the beneficiary while UK inheritance tax is based on the country of domicile of the deceased person (i.e. the disponer). A double taxation treaty between both countries, as mentioned by the Deputy, provides for tax relief where a particular asset that is included in an inheritance is taxed in both countries.  The relief operates by granting a credit against any Irish tax due of the amount of UK tax paid in respect of an asset (such as a property) which is situated in the UK. </p>  <p>  For a credit to be granted under the treaty, there must first be an Irish inheritance tax liability. For inheritance tax purposes, the relationship between the disponer and the beneficiary determines the maximum tax-free amount known as the &ldquo;Group threshold&rdquo; below which inheritance tax does not arise. The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) is relevant in this case and applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. </p>  <p>  Any prior inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives an inheritance(s) that exceeds the relevant tax-free threshold, inheritance tax at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax-free threshold.</p>  <p>  From the information supplied by the Deputy it is not possible to be definitive as how the double taxation relief will apply in this case. As the Deputy will be aware, the Revenue Commissioners are independent in their dealings with the tax affairs of any individual and therefore the person should be advised to contact his or her local Revenue Office and outline the circumstances of the inheritance to ascertain how the credit system will operate in his or her particular case. </p></reply>

There are approximately 200,000 registered employers and around 2.3 million employees with a significant number of these having more than one employment. The nature of the current PAYE system is such that it gives rise to a high number of contacts from taxpayers throughout the year.  For example, Revenue&rsquo;s Employee Helpline handled around 1.3 million telephone calls in 2017 and a significant amount of Revenue&rsquo;s staff resources are deployed to handle these calls.</p>  <p>  The PAYE Modernisation programme represents the most significant change to the PAYE system since its introduction more than fifty years ago.  At the heart of the programme is the new real-time reporting requirement to Revenue for employers in respect of employee income and statutory deductions, including income tax, PRSI, USC and Local Property Tax, which must be completed with each payroll run. There will be no change to the actual payment dates and as such no cash-flow implications for employers.   </p>  <p>  Once the system goes live on 1 January 2019 it will bring improved accuracy and transparency for all stakeholders, including employers, employees and Revenue and will also significantly streamline the entire administrative process. To ensure optimum benefits, Revenue has worked extensively with all relevant stakeholders over the past two years in a co-design approach. This has included employers, representative bodies and the payroll industry to ensure the new reporting system successfully delivers these benefits while also reducing the administrative burden to the greatest extent possible. </p>  <p>  For example, from 1 January 2019, the PAYE reporting process will be significantly simplified by the elimination of the various forms (e.g. P30, P45, P46, P35, P60,) that must currently be completed while also ensuring that employee tax deductions and other contributions are accurately reflected. As every employer will be required to provide information on employees&rsquo; pay and statutory deductions each time they pay their employees, Revenue will have the most up to date pay and deductions details available to it, which will be of major assistance in ensuring that taxpayers benefit fully from their various credits and entitlements. Also, for the first time, employees will be able to view the information reported to Revenue on their behalf by employers.</p>  <p>  It is too early to identify any staff savings that will accrue from the new system. Revenue has advised me that its initial focus will be on supporting employers to meet the new obligations arising from PAYE Modernisation and to assist employees on an individual basis where necessary. Once the system is successfully implemented, Revenue will reassign any staff available at that point to other priority work, including compliance activity.</p>  <p>  The issue of resources for the administration of Pay Related Social Insurance is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 (Act 21 of 2018) was signed into law in July this year. The Act, inter alia, provides for the payment of 100% of the compensation due to Setanta third party personal injury motor insurance claimants including the additional 35% to those who have settled their claims and have already received compensation of 65% of their claim. The same principle of full payment will apply to third party property motor insurance claimants subject to a limit of &euro;1.22 million (in line with Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland limits).</p>  <p>  The Act also provides for revised arrangements for the ongoing management and administration of the Insurance Compensation Fund, including for applications to the High Court. These revised arrangements have now been put in place.</p>  <p>  As the Courts have just re-commenced this week, no date has yet been fixed for the next tranche of payments.  However, I am informed by the State Claims Agency that much of the preparatory work has been completed. They have also advised this next tranche will comprise of new cases where 100% will be paid, all the cases where the balance of 35% is due, as well as a number of third party legal costs payments. In total it is expected that there will be in the region of 1,500 payments made with a value of approximately &euro;21 million.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while I hope that a court date can be agreed by the end of October, it is possible that this may slip into the first half of November.   You can rest assured however that every effort is being made to process these payments as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that only claims which have been settled can be included in applications to the High Court for payment from the ICF. The Liquidator has advised that the process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties.  Therefore for such cases it is not possible at this stage to give any indication when payment will be made. However, I believe that by the State having taken steps to ensure that third party claimants are compensated in full, that this will encourage the settlement of all outstanding claims as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, continuous driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein or, indeed, whether the country is a member of the EU or not.</p><p>In relation to the implementation of this recommendation, Insurance Ireland submitted a report to the Department in December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website. </p><p>The Insurance Ireland report also outlined some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provided figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) decreased during the first six months of 2017.  I understand that the DCA figures subsequently provided in respect of the second half of last year showed that this downward trend continued throughout the remainder of 2017.  The next report on the operation of the DCA, outlining the figures for 2018, is due to be submitted to my Department in Q1 2019. Officials will examine the breakdown of the number of cases in the report to determine if the downward trend is continuing.</p><p>It is important to highlight that if a returning emigrant believes that they have received a high quote due to an insurance provider not accepting driving experience gained while abroad, they should contact the free Insurance Information Service operated by Insurance Ireland, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761820. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy should also note that I am continuing to monitor the implementation of this recommendation through my Department&rsquo;s regular engagement with Insurance Ireland. </p></reply>

This was only slightly over profile, by &euro;13 million, and &euro;3,208 million, or 7.7 per cent, higher than expenditure for the same period in 2017. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;41,601 million was &euro;265 million, or 0.6 per cent ahead of profile and &euro;2,451 million, or 6.3 per cent ahead of the same period last year. As set out in the September 2018 Fiscal Monitor, at the end of September 2018, 13 out of 17 Ministerial Vote Groups were either broadly in line or below profile, with an aggregate underspend across these 13 Ministerial Vote Groups of &euro;188 million versus their gross current expenditure profiles. </p><p>At this stage of the year, it is difficult to accurately predict the scale of potential underspends at the end of the year to be surrendered to the Exchequer. However, the expenditure outturns for the last two years provide an indication of the potential range. </p><p>As reported in the December 2017 Fiscal Monitor, gross voted expenditure in 12 out of 17 Vote Groups was in line or below profile for the year. These profiles reflected the allocations set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2017 published in December 2016 and the Further Revised Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il on 17th October 2017. Across these 12 Vote groups, there was an aggregate underspend on current expenditure of &euro;208 million. As set out in the December 2016 Exchequer Statement, gross voted expenditure in 11 out of 16 Ministerial Vote Groups finished the year at or below their total expenditure profile. The aggregate underspend on current expenditure across these 11 Vote Groups was &euro;238 million. </p><p>Thus, the level of underspends on current expenditure by Vote groups that underspent relative to profile in 2016 and 2017 suggests that underspends for 2018 of the order of approximately &euro;0.2 billion could reasonably be expected.</p></reply>

I negotiated, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers. </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, since 1 October 2018 the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,318, and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On Monday 24th September, I welcomed, together with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the outcome of discussions between public service employers and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants at points 4 and 8 of their scale. </p>  <p>  For example, a teachers hired in September 2011 would see their salary increase from &euro;45,200 in September 2018 to &euro;53,062 in September 2020 under the PSSA agreement and the recent outcome of the new entrant pay talks. </p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible. Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.</p>  <p>  The greater proportion of children with ASD attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. </p>  <p>  Some students with ASD, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there and placement in an ASD special class is an option for them. ASD special classes are resourced to cater for six pupils with complex educational needs arising from their diagnosis of autism and as such are staffed with a reduced PTR (6:1 Primary and 6:1.5 Post Primary) and two Special Needs Assistants. </p>  <p>  Special school placements are provided for other students with ASD and very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers, for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 130% from 548 in 2011 to 1,456 across the country now, of which 1,192 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. This network includes 129 ASD early intervention classes, 742 primary ASD classes and 321 post-primary ASD classes in mainstream schools.</p>  <p>  There are 37 special schools and 235 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Dublin. Of these, 17 are ASD early intervention classes, 138 are primary ASD classes and 40 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 195 in 2017/2018. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie in county order.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year in Dublin, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need. I have arranged for the Deputy's question on emerging need to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education has published Guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which contain information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes and are available to download from www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  My Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities has been challenging.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I signed a Commencement Order on the 4th of October bringing a number of sections of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act, 2018 into operation. </p>  <p>  The commencement order will provide the Minister for Education and Skills with a power, after a process of consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.

It is in that context that I will formulate my specific budgetary priorities.  </p>  <p>  I have set 4 key areas where I am seeking to make improvements in order to meet our objective to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe: the quality of the learning experience; the capacity to meet the needs of those at a disadvantage or with special needs to fulfil their potential; the environment for schools to be innovative and continuously improve their capacity to serve their pupils' needs; and the collaboration and bridges which education and training institutions build with their wider communities to meet the changing needs of our country.  </p>  <p>  DEIS Plan 2017 allows for a reduced class size in Urban Band 1 primary schools to accommodate class size of 20:1 at junior classes and 24:1 at senior classes to support those students at the highest risk of educational disadvantage.  Under DEIS Plan 2017, there is a commitment to evaluate the level of teaching resources for schools participating in the School Support Programme to inform future policy in this area and this evaluation is currently underway.</p></reply>

This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis, it has been decided to conduct further quality assurance on the model before extending these envisaged uses of the model. Therefore, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools until this work is complete. </p>  <p>  DEIS Plan 2017 provides that if we are to have the maximum possible impact on providing opportunities for students most at risk of disadvantage, then our extra resources must be targeted as closely as possible at those students with the greatest level of need.</p>  <p>  Work has commenced on identifying such interventions that are having the greatest impact on tackling educational disadvantage. This will involve testing new approaches in groups of schools and working closely with schools in school self-evaluation and planning improvements. </p></reply>

The cost for the allocation of additional teaching hours to primary and post-primary schools participating in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme from September 2018 was estimated at in the region of &euro;1m. This estimate was based on the provision of additional hours to all primary and post-primary Gaeltacht schools under the terms of Department of Education and Skills Circulars 0033/2017 and 0034/2017, and Circulars 0021/2018 and 0022/2018 for primary and post-primary schools in the Gaeltacht. Funding  for up to 30 participants on a new Irish-medium M.Ed. programme commencing from September 2018 was estimated at &euro;210,000 on the basis of the norms for the cost of teacher education places. Implementation of the e-hub digital project in post-primary schools was estimated at a cost of &euro;70,000 in 2018, however, it should be noted that the cost of project implementation was estimated when the project was at an embryonic stage of development. The allocation of hours for the For&aacute;s language development programme in two post-primary schools in the Gaeltacht was estimated at &euro;120,000 on the basis of the allocation of two ex-quota teaching posts to two schools. The estimated budget to support an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG) in the implementation of Policy actions, including the extra allocation of  two Education Officers to COGG, amounted to in the region of &euro;200,000. Provision for substitute cover for primary and post-primary teachers attending additional CPD under the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, which was estimated on the basis of attendance by schools at the CPD in accordance with Circulars  0033/2017, 0034/2017, 0021/2018 and 0022/2018, was estimated at in the region of &euro;120,000 for 2018. Provision for printing, administration and staffing of the Gaeltacht Education Unit in the Department was estimated in the region of &euro;220,000. </p>  <p>  A further &euro;133,000 was estimated to cover the cost of the payment of a grant, for the purchase of Irish-medium resources, to primary and post-primary schools participating in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme, while in the region of &euro;210,000 was estimated to cover the cost of release days and CPD for new entrants to the Scheme, along with provision for associates and the secondment of two teachers to NUIG to support implementation of the Policy.</p>  <p>  Overall expenditure across Policy actions in 2018 is in line with the estimated expenditure of &euro;2.3m.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-04a.278.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100400051#WRE04300"><p>Brexit has brought ever-sharper focus upon the importance for Irish companies of pursuing  diversified export markets as well as new market opportunities. This includes markets that are growing as well as markets where there is already a well established presence but with potential for further growth.  Supporting such actions are key priorities for Government and my Department.  </p>  <p>  Ministerial-led Trade Missions support the Government's major drive towards market diversification.  The majority of trade missions are taking place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represent the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies.  These Trade Missions focus on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offers of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences.   </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52% to between 55% and 60% by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020. The strategy also targets a 50% increase in the number of FDI investments from non-US markets by 2020.</p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets.  In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to a 50% increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in June 2018, the Government formally launched the &lsquo;Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025&rsquo; initiative. Global Ireland will support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism, as Brexit becomes a reality. It will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend its positions in a post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future. Under the Global Ireland initiative Enterprise Ireland will further increase the diversification of client exports into new markets, with the ambition that 70% of exports will go to markets beyond the UK by 2025.</p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more. These existing suite of EU Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and in this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities. </p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  For a medicine to be considered for reimbursement by the HSE, it must first have a marketing authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), before being assessed under the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. </p>  <p>  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention. This process ensures that only treatments that are clinical and cost effective are reimbursed. </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  Nusinersen (Spinraza) is indicated for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a disorder characterised by progressive muscle atrophy and weakness.  </p>  <p>  In May 2017, the EMA granted market authorisation for nusinersen and in October 2017, the HSE received a reimbursement application for nusinersen.  </p>  <p>  In December 2017, the NCPE completed a HTA of nusinersen and did not recommend reimbursement at the price submitted. No decision has been arrived as yet on the application for the reimbursement of nusinersen as the statutory process is still on-going.</p></reply>

The Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan, published last April outlines the combined impact of HSE and NTPF activity in 2018. </p>  <p>  Waiting list data from the National Treatment Purchase Fund shows that at the end of August 2018 there were 1,845 patients on the Inpatient/Daycase (IPDC) waiting list at Mayo General Hospital, representing an increase of 407 patients on the same period last year. It is of note that 83% of patients are waiting 9 months or less for treatment. </p>  <p>  This year, Mayo General Hospital have submitted proposals to the National Treatment Purchase Fund to facilitate the provision of treatment for 255 long waiting Inpatient/Daycase patients.</p>  <p>  Outpatient waiting list data for the end of August, shows that there were 8,244 patients waiting for an outpatient appoint at Mayo General Hospital, representing a slight increase of 4% on the same period last year. </p>  <p>  In order to address the issue of growing outpatient waiting list numbers, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are in the process of finalising an Outpatient Action Plan for the remainder of 2018.

The manufacturer, CSL Behring, was notified in August 2017 that the HSE was unable to recommend reimbursement. The HSE concluded that there was not enough evidence to suggest that patients would derive a clinically meaningful benefit from this treatment and that the current price was not a cost effective use of resources.</p><p>A number of patients were on an access scheme for this product, operated by the manufacturer, for the treatment of Alpha-1 deficiency. This scheme was being run independently by the manufacturer without reference to the HSE.</p><p>Late last year the company decided to terminate the access scheme. Following interventions by the HSE, the company modified its decision and agreed to continue to supply the medication free of charge for the patients on the access scheme but stipulated that it would not cover the cost of administering the medicine.</p><p>Due to the critical and exceptional circumstances, the HSE decided to facilitate a transitional arrangement, under which it would fund the necessary nursing service to ensure that patients would continue to receive the medicine until a new clinical trial commences.</p><p>The terms of this transitional arrangement, under which the HSE has agreed to fund the administration of the drug, include a requirement that the lead clinician (who is the patients' treating consultant) ensures that appropriate alternative treatment regimes are put in place for those patients not proceeding onto the next trial.</p><p>This transitional arrangement for the 19 Alpha 1 clinical trial patients does not alter the reimbursement decision of the HSE in relation to Respreeza.  The company is welcome to submit a new reimbursement application which will be assessed in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>The HSE is continuing to liaise with the treating Consultant and the Pharmaceutical Company in relation to the long term care of this group of patients (19 Alpha 1 clinical trial patients) on the condition that the company would continue to supply the medicine into 2019.  </p><p>The HSE has indicated that negotiations with the Company in respect of the 19 Alpha 1 clinical trial patients are in the final stages.</p></reply>

BCG vaccine stock in all areas expired at the end of April 2015. Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office (NIO) has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available. There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland. The NIO and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) have sought an alternative supply of BCG vaccine that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland. To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer has been found. When there is confirmation of a date for a new supply, the HSE will be guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee on its administration.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  For a medicine to be considered for reimbursement by the HSE, it must first have a marketing authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), before being assessed under the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. </p>  <p>  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention. This process ensures that only treatments that are clinical and cost effective are reimbursed. </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  Nusinersen (Spinraza) is indicated for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a disorder characterised by progressive muscle atrophy and weakness.  </p>  <p>  In May 2017, the EMA granted market authorisation for nusinersen and in October 2017, the HSE received a reimbursement application for nusinersen.  </p>  <p>  In December 2017, the NCPE completed a HTA of nusinersen and did not recommend reimbursement at the price submitted. No decision has been arrived as yet on the application for the reimbursement of nusinersen as the statutory process is still on-going.</p>  <p>  Two members of the Beneluxa Initiative (Belgium and the Netherlands) completed a joint negotiation for the reimbursement of nusinersen in July 2018. This process began before Ireland joined the collaboration and Ireland was not party to these negotiations.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s primary concern is that their needs are being prioritised and addressed. </p>  <p>  Over 23,000 older people and 8,500 people with a disability are currently in receipt of residential care in Ireland from over 1,600 service providers. The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the statutory independent regulator for residential services in the Disability and Older Persons sectors.</p>  <p>  HIQA has published standards against which it registers residential services for older people and those with a disability. These standards establish the requirements for people living in residential care in order to ensure high-quality, safe and effective services which promote person-centred care, uphold the rights of people, respect privacy and dignity, and protect people living in residential care from abuse and neglect.  </p>  <p>  Service providers must ensure that all reasonable measures are taken to protect residents from all forms of abuse.  They must have policies and procedures in place for the prevention, detection and response to abuse.  Furthermore, operators must notify HIQA of any allegation of abuse or serious adverse incidents that occur in a residential centre.</p>  <p>  HIQA welcomes information about designated centres for dependent persons, reviews all information about services received and evaluates it against the regulations and standards. If there is a serious risk to the health and welfare of persons accessing the service, HIQA may decide to take appropriate action.</p>  <p>  A report by HIQA on the use of information gathered and received in the regulation of services was received by my Department this week and we are currently examining this very useful document.  </p>  <p>  The report outlines how unsolicited information and mandated monitoring notifications are received and reviewed by an inspector of social services who assesses the related risk and decides on a regulatory response. Every piece of information received, whether unsolicited or mandated, is reviewed in such a manner. </p>  <p>  Some concerns were raised recently in the media about the manner in which unsolicited information received by HIQA was dealt with. HIQA reports that in 2017, 820 pieces of unsolicited information were received related to older persons services. In the case of 342 of these pieces of information, further information or a provider-led investigation of the issue identified was requested following initial review and risk rating of the information. Review of the unsolicited information triggered 17 targeted inspections. HIQA concluded that none of the issues raised by the unsolicited information required referral to other organisations.</p>  <p>  HIQA reports that in the case of disability services, from 298 pieces of unsolicited information, further investigation or provider-led investigation was requested in 140 cases, 10 targeted inspections were triggered, and none of the issues raised by the unsolicited information required referral to other organisations.</p>  <p>  Where referrals are required, they take place. In the case of Children&rsquo;s Services, 13 of the 108 pieces of unsolicited information received were signposted to Tusla&rsquo;s complaints process, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children's Office and/or  the Health and Social Care Professionals Regulator, CORU.</p>  <p>  HIQA is very open and transparent in relation to the information it gathers in its regulation of services. It publishes an annual report. The Chief Inspector publishes an overview report detailing the quality and safety of services and areas of high risk. In addition, HIQA publishes every individual report as to the quality and safety of services within its legislative remit. All of these reports are publicly available on the website hiqa.ie. HIQA also has a project underway looking at improving its data sharing agreements and enhancing its memorandums of understanding with other agencies. </p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

An issue arose in relation to a parcel of land that was included in their Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) and the Organic Farming Scheme.  The AEOS action selected by the person did not permit payment on that parcel under the Organic Farming Scheme due to the issue of double funding.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, upon transforming their AEOS contract to the Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) different actions were chosen on the parcel in question.  This change permitted payments under both the GLAS and Organic Farming schemes.  Due to a retrospective AEOS payment issued in respect of 2016, the OFS payment on this parcel was initially blocked.</p>  <p>  My Department's staff have now rectified the issue that was preventing the 2016 OFS payment for the land parcel in question. The OFS payment in respect of same will issue this week. </p></reply>

The afforestation scheme offers a fixed grant towards the costs, subject to the maximum laid down in the scheme&rsquo;s terms and conditions. In addition, annual premiums are payable to new forests which qualify for an afforestation grant for a maximum period of 15 years.</p><p>There is no distinction between the rate paid to farmers and non-farmers under the 2014-2020 Forestry Programme as the aim is to make the afforestation scheme accessible to all landowners; this allows retired farmers,  sons and daughters of farmers or other relatives who might have inherited land but who have careers outside of farming to take part in the scheme, as well as other private investors. </p><p>My Department compiles a number of different afforestation statistics annually, which are made available on my Department's website.

While there are no targets in place for broadleaf tree planting at the reforestation stage, where environmental sensitivities exist the inclusion of broadleaves may be a condition of the tree-felling licence. As broadleaves are not generally clearfelled, the percentage of broadleaves continues to grow and according to the most recent National Forest Inventory has increased by 3% between 2013 and 2017 bringing the overall broadleaf area to 28.7% of the national forest estate.</p><p>In the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 a target was set to plant 30% of the area of new forests created annually with broadleaf tree species. My Department is making a monthly return to the European Commission on this rate which I am pleased to note has increased this year, largely as a direct result of measures introduced in the mid-term review of the Forestry Programme.</p><p>Detailed annual information on reforestation is not available for the period requested. However the third National Forest Inventory completed in 2017 provides information on species composition in reforestation site that are 10 years old and younger. The re-stocking species and figures are shown below;<table><tr><th>Species</th><th>Area (ha)  </th><th>Percent Area (%)</th></tr><tr><td>Sitka spruce</td><td>36,660</td><td>60.7</td></tr><tr><td>Norway spruce</td><td>557</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td>birch spp.</td><td>5,340</td><td>8.9</td></tr><tr><td>Scots pine</td><td>16</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>other pines</td><td>7,939</td><td>13.2</td></tr><tr><td>Douglas fir</td><td>3</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>alder</td><td>1,370</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>larch spp.</td><td>1,378</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>ash</td><td>1,432</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>beech</td><td>66</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>sycamore</td><td>156</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>sessile &amp;amp; pedunculate oak</td><td>600</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>other conifers</td><td>3</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Other short living broadleaves </td><td>3,698</td><td>6.1</td></tr><tr><td>Other long living broadleaves </td><td>1,085</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>60,302</td><td>100</td></tr></table></p><p>All new forests must be established in compliance with national and EU legislation and the Department&rsquo;s requirements as set out in the Forestry Standards Manual, Scheme Documents, Code of Best Practice &ndash; Ireland and the suite of environmental guidelines including the Environmental Requirements for Afforestation and the Land Types for Afforestation, to ensure that the establishment of new forests is carried out in a way that is compatible with the protection and enhancement of our environment, particularly in relation to water, biodiversity, archaeology, soil type and the landscape. The scheme documents set out the requirements at the design stage, the site works stage and the ongoing management.  The Form 1 application records the initial application and sets out the project in accordance with the Environmental Requirements for afforestation document.  Failure to do so, following an assessment of the application by DAFM, may result in a request for further information to rectify the application, additional conditions,  or refusal.  Post planting the site may be inspected for compliance with the Environmental Requirements.  The site is also subject to inspection at year 4 and at any point during the 15 year premium run.</p><p>The Department regularly issues Circulars to update all internal and external stakeholders on new developments or to clarify any issues that arise and in the last two years has issued five circulars related to biodiversity and the environment aspects of forestry. Some of these are to update on policy changes while others for example are to announce mandatory training for registered foresters on the revised guidelines. I have no concern that these measures are not being implemented uniformly as we operate to one common regulatory system for forestry in Ireland. </p><p>The Department has also encouraged all registered foresters to register with the Society of Foresters and participate in their Continuous Professional Development programme which is funded by the Department. </p><p>Under the DAFM / EPA Acid Sensitivity Protocol, afforestation applications within certain defined areas of the country must be accompanied by water sampling at pre-approval stage, to assess the sensitivity of receiving waters to acidification.</p><p>In summary, sampling and analysis by an accredited laboratory must be carried out on at least four separate occasions within the period 1st February to the 31st May inclusive, with each sample taken at least 28 days apart. Where the minimum alkalinity of any one of the four samples taken is &amp;lt;8 mg CaCO<sub>3</sub>/ litre, no afforestation is permitted. If the result is 8-15 mg CaCO<sub>3</sub>/ litre, full, partial or no afforestation may be approved, following discussion and agreement between DAFM, EPA and Inland Fisheries Ireland. If the result is &amp;gt;15 mg CaCO<sub>3</sub>/ litre, afforestation may be licensed.</p><p>It should be noted that where landowners or foresters get negative water sample results they may not proceed with potential applications and therefore the amount of sampling conducted may be greater than that reflected in the numbers submitted to the Department.</p><p>It should also be noted that, since early 2013, water sampling under the Acid Sensitivity Protocol is not required for afforestation applications which relate to native woodland creation, as these are not considered  to have the same potential acidifying effect as other categories of afforestation.</p></reply>

The measures adopted will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector to develop in an economically and environmentally sustainable way, as well as the relevant research and the available budget and structure of the new CAP when it is finalised. </p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  </p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector. National Farm Survey data suggests that suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.</p></reply>

Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. </p><p>The Price Monitoring Group has considered twelve months of data to date.

The Directive gives Member States the option to allow children to travel without child restraints in the rear of small public service vehicles if restraints are not available.  In allowing for such arrangements in relation to the rear seats of small public service vehicles, the Directive recognises that child restraint systems come in a number of different weight classes and that it would not be reasonable to expect drivers of these vehicles to always have the appropriate child restraint available in their vehicles.  For that reason, in making the Regulations to transpose the Directive into Irish law, the option in the Directive permitting children to travel without child restraints in the rear of small public service vehicles was reluctantly exercised.  The Regulations, however, require children who are 3 years of age or over and 135 centimetres or more in height travelling in the rear of small public service vehicles not fitted with child restraints to wear safety belts.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the legal position, it would be my desire that owners of small public service vehicles would endeavour to provide child restraints in so far as it is practicable to do so.  </p></reply>

Based on the interim recommendations of the Taskforce, I was pleased to secure funding in Budget 2018 to introduce a new toll incentive regime for EVs, as well as an EV grant scheme specifically for the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector, which involves taxis, hackneys and limousines.</p>  <p>  The Electric SPSV Grant Scheme opened to applicants in February this year, and provides purchase reliefs of up to &euro;7,000 for Battery Electric Vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles. I have allocated &euro;500,000 from my Department's "Green Public Transport Fund" in support of the initiative.</p>  <p>  According to the most recent figures received from the National Transport Authority, by 24 September 2018 24 grants totalling &euro;152,000 had been paid or authorised. Encouragingly, all but one of these SPSV vehicles in receipt of the grant so far are Battery Electric Vehicles, which are fully zero-emission. </p>  <p>  A total of 118 applications have been received so far and almost 90% of these have been provisionally offered grant assistance under the Scheme subject to initial suitability tests, therefore I am very hopeful that the uptake of the grant and the advancement of electric vehicles in our SPSV fleet will continue to grow.</p></reply>

Alongside this, our considerable planned investment in the bus system through the new BusConnects programme - initially in Dublin and then followed by other cities - will also support the construction of, where possible, segregated cycle lanes along the improved bus corridors;  the aim in Dublin is to deliver around 200 kilometres of quality cycling facilities as part of the bus upgrade.

The European Tour contacted the Department in late August and early September to inquire if either Minister Griffin or I would be interested in attending the event.  In the normal course, a Minister would attend significant international sporting events where Irish athletes or sports people are involved.  Ireland's involvement in the 2018 Ryder Cup included one player and two Vice-Captains.  However, neither I nor Minister Griffin were available to attend due to other commitments.  Consequently, both Minister Griffin and I indicated to the European Tour that we would not be in a position to attend.  Rather, given the Irish involvement in the European Team, consideration would be given to attendance by officials. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, the European Tour conveyed their wish to discuss the hosting of a future Ryder Cup in Ireland and sought a meeting to discuss same with Ministers and officials.  The European Tour requested that the meeting would be held at Le Golf National in Paris on one of the three days of the Ryder Cup.  </p>  <p>  The hosting of a Ryder Cup gives rise to considerable economic value in the host country.  Deloitte have reported on the value to the Irish economy of the 2006 Ryder Cup.  The direct economic value was estimated to be more than &euro;140m and the full impact was reported to be around &euro;240m.  Similarly, the value to the Scottish and Welsh economies, from the 2014 and 2010 events respectively, have been reported and are substantial.</p>  <p>  Given the potential value of hosting a future Ryder Cup in Ireland, I reconsidered the European Tour's request for a meeting.  On 26 September, I decided that I would travel out to Paris to meet with the European Tour and I cancelled my prior commitments for the day of the meeting, i.e. Sunday, 30 September. I, along with the Secretary General of my Department, the Assistant Secretary with responsibility for tourism and sport and my Special Advisor, travelled to Paris and arrived in Paris on the evening of 29 September.   </p>  <p>  Flights for me and my Special Advisor were booked on 26 September and flight bookings for the Secretary General and Assistant Secretary were made on 21 September. The total cost of flights was &euro;1,989.70.  No costs were incurred for accommodation as this was provided by the European Tour.</p>  <p>  Discussions with the European Tour began at a meeting in a pavilion at 11.30 a.m. at Le Golf National.  Discussions continued with a viewing of the event infrastructure and facilities, followed by a second meeting at approximately 2 p.m. on Sunday 30 September.  The European Tour was represented by Mr. David Williams, Chairman of the European Tour, Mr. Keith Pelley, CEO of the European Tour, Mr. Guy Kinnings, European Tour Deputy CEO, Mr. Richard Hills, Ryder Cup Director, and Mr. Paul McGinley.  Mr. McGinley is a former Ryder Cup Captain and also a member of the European Tour Board.</p></reply>

I have prioritised the work of developing a new integrated funding scheme as recommended by the Value for Money and Policy Review.

In this regard, the Child Care Act 1991 (as amended), requires Tusla to take reasonable steps to make available accommodation to children who present as homeless, without parents or guardians, and have no accommodation that they can reasonably occupy. In general, these children are taken into the care of Tusla or, in the case of children aged 16 or 17, they may be provided with accommodation under section 5 of the Act. </p>  <p>  Where children and young people are homeless as part of a family experiencing homelessness, my Department is working closely with Tusla to provide supports to mitigate the challenges faced by these parents and children. These include the introduction of free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness. As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate. The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation.</p>  <p>  Tusla works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness. Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of families in emergency accommodation. These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation and is fully operational. A Joint Working Protocol has also been signed between Tusla and Galway City Council. It is intended to replicate this protocol across the State.</p>  <p>  The DRHE is coordinating the development of a comprehensive National Quality Standards Framework for homeless services on behalf of all housing authorities.  Consultation with service users and key stakeholders, including Tusla, has been undertaken and the draft standards have been piloted in selected services.  These standards, including a child safety element which will provide homeless services with a framework for continuous quality improvement, will be implemented nationally. </p>  <p>  Funding is in place under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) enabling Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to acquire residential units to accommodate young people exiting State care. My Department has collaborated with Tusla on the development of principles and criteria relating to funding proposals. Where accommodation is provided under CAS, Tusla will provide additional independent living supports, in particular for the most vulnerable Care Leavers, in accordance with the individual&rsquo;s pre-agreed aftercare plan. Tusla has also redistributed its protocol on young people leaving State care to Housing Authorities. The aim of this protocol is to ensure that the necessary measures are in place to prevent homelessness for young people leaving State care. This will be applied and considered within aftercare steering groups.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances. Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians. Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness. In the meantime, within my area of responsibility I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible.</p></reply>

This demonstrates Government's commitment to investing in the childcare sector, but, as you will have heard me state many times, it is critical that the Government continues this investment to benefit all children and family types. </p>  <p>  It is important that we acknowledge the role played by staff working in the childcare sector. Childcare workers play a critical role in delivering high quality early learning and school age care  services and they deserve to be recognised, valued and respected for this. I do however acknowledge that pay and conditions are major issues facing the sector. My Department is engaging with the early years sector to explore how this can be addressed. As one of a number of interventions in this regard, I increased standard and higher capitation rates for ECCE by 7% from September 2018.</p>  <p>  It must be noted that my Department is not the employer of childcare workers. However, in terms of improving pay and conditions I have engaged directly with the sector, and have suggested  that one approach the sector could consider is applying for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO) through the Labour Court, seeking a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years sector. </p>  <p>  It should be highlighted that the first ever Independent Review into the Cost of Delivery of Quality Childcare is underway and will inform our future policy decisions in this area. This 'Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Quality Childcare' is examining the costs faced by childcare providers in delivering quality childcare, including a survey of childcare providers. The review is intended to be used to strengthen the evidence base underpinning future policy development and investment in early years. The Independent Review is a critical input to the on-going reform of childcare in Ireland and is a commitment in the Programme for Government. It is expected that the report from this work, including the cost model and calculator, will be finalised over the coming period. </p>  <p>  My Department is working hard to develop the new national Affordable Childcare Scheme and I am pleased to say we are making good progress.  The scheme will provide financial support for parents and will establish a sustainable platform for investment in the childcare sector for generations to come. </p>  <p>  Legislation establishing the new Affordable Childcare Scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was enacted before the summer recess.  This will be underpinned by detailed secondary legislation and formal policy guidelines, both of which are currently in development, along with regulations to provide for the registration of school-age childcare services by Tusla. These regulations will be introduced in advance of the Affordable Childcare Scheme to allow school-age childcare services to register and thereby participate in the scheme from the outset.</p>  <p>  The interim measures which I introduced in September 2017 to fast-track some of the benefits of the Affordable Childcare Scheme have already supported more than 84,000 children and will remain in place until the new scheme goes live.</p>  <p>  Finally, I intend to seek government approval shortly for a cross Government, 10 year Early Years Strategy which will have a significant focus on early learning and care and school age childcare. This strategy will set out objectives, strategic actions and deliverables that I hope will result in increased investment in the area, to the benefit of children, families, our society and our economy.</p></reply>

One of these is the State pension (contributory), qualification for which is based on a number of criteria. </p>  <p>  As a general policy the Government intends to introduce a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to establishing level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards (TCA2020). I launched a public consultation on this proposal earlier this year in May, which closed last month. The consultation sought input on a range of relevant factors which included the amount of contributions needed for a full rate contributory state pension, the amount of credited contributions a person could avail of, the provision of homecaring periods and whether there would be a "phase-in period" for the changes.</p>  <p>  Following examination and consideration of the submissions to the consultation, my officials will prepare proposals for the design of the new approach for consideration by the Government in due course.</p>  <p>  In the interim, on 23 January last, this Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated on a Total Contributions basis, including provision for up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.</p>  <p>  My Department will be writing to impacted customers in the next two months to explain to them what is happening and how the process of review will work.  As I have stated previously, it is planned to commence these reviews before the end of this year, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019, backdated, where relevant, to the end of March 2018, or later where a person attained their 66th birthday since that date. </p>  <p>  It is not necessary for people to contact the Department on this matter.  Once the legislation is enacted and the systems and processes are ready, my Department will then write again to the people impacted and provide them with the opportunity to have their pension calculation reviewed.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should  note that for those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), because they have paid few or no contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  </p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that the marriage bar describes a rule that existed in most of the public service, and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  As it was a rule rather than a general legal prohibition against employing married women, they could either return to work or take up other work, and many did.  It is also worth remembering that most public servants recruited prior to 1995 are not entitled to the State pension, regardless of gender and marital status.  Therefore, the marriage bar would not generally have negatively impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  The implications it had for public service pensions are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For weekly earnings of &euro;352 or less no PRSI is charged.  Once weekly earnings exceed &euro;352, Class A PRSI at the rate of 4% is charged on all earnings.  Prior to the introduction of the PRSI credit in January 2016, the weekly PRSI charge for employees whose earnings for the first time exceed &euro;352 increased from nil to &euro;14.08. This &quot;step effect&quot; created a significant poverty trap for those who received an increase in their earnings or who increased their engagement in the workforce.</p><p>The PRSI credit was introduced in 2016 to address this &quot;step effect&quot; by reducing the weekly PRSI charge from &euro;14.08 to &euro;2.08, at earnings of &euro;352.01.  For weekly earnings between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424.00, the maximum weekly PRSI credit of &euro;12 is reduced on a tapered basis.  At earnings of &euro;424.01, the credit is exhausted. </p><p>The fact that the PRSI credit applies between &euro;352 and &euro;424 means that the measure is targeted at those in the earnings range directly affected by the previous &quot;step effect&quot; and ensures the cost efficiency of the measure.  It is estimated that the credit will have a cost of &euro;18.3m in 2019.While it is appreciated that there is a calculation involved in the determination of the level of credit to apply to individual employees, this calculation is fully explained on the Department's website, and in the Department's information guides and leaflets.</p><p>Increasing the PRSI employee threshold to &euro;424 would lead to the creation of a new &quot;step effect&quot; where no PRSI charge would arise at &euro;424 but an increase in pay would mean a charge of &euro;16.94 would arise. This new, higher, &quot;step effect&quot; would create a new poverty trap which would have to be alleviated by the introduction a new PRSI credit.  This would incur further costs to the Social Insurance Fund.  </p><p>Increasing the employee PRSI threshold to From &euro;352 to &euro;424 would cost &euro;25.8m and affect 102,000 employees.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

However, such rental income is reduced by a range of deductions. These include: </p><p>i. a proportion of any mortgage interest paid by the claimant on the part of the property rented; </p><p>ii. a 15% deduction for voids (i.e. periods when the accommodation is vacant between lettings); and, </p><p>iii. if the rooms let are furnished, a 5% deduction for wear and tear.</p><p>In this regard, the cash value of any rental income is not assessed in full, as at least 20% of such income is disregarded. </p><p>Fully disregarding all rental income would run contrary to the policy of ensuring that social welfare expenditure is targeted to those who need it the most. It could also potentially negatively impact on the incentive to work for working age recipients. </p><p>Any change to my Department&rsquo;s means assessment policies would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p></reply>

It will also be an offence for an employer who deliberately or recklessly provides false or misleading information to an employee as part of this statement of core terms of employment. It is important to state that the Bill also provides for appropriate defences for employers. </p><p>The purpose of creating this offence provision is to promote better work practices and provide greater clarity around the essential elements of the employment relationship for both the employer and the employee. At the start of the employment relationship, every employee should be entitled to know basic information such as who his/her employer is, how much s(he) will get paid and what the employer reasonably expects the normal length of the working day and working week will be. I genuinely believe that it should not be difficult for employers to provide this information. </p><p>Following a public consultation, the Government decided the core terms of employment that should be provided to employees very early in the employment relationship &ndash; on or by Day Five. The remainder of the required terms of employment will continue to be provided within the current two month period. If the employer still has not provided the statement of core terms after a month of employment it will become an offence. </p><p>However, prosecution will be the ultimate sanction. The WRC will first seek the compliance of the employer on a voluntary basis. Furthermore, the Bill also provides for fixed payment notices as an alternative to prosecution and such notices may be issued by WRC inspectors in lieu of prosecution for less egregious offences. </p><p>In relation to the proposal to require employers to offer any surplus hours to existing part-time employees, I should point out that this provision was included in the Bill as a result of an opposition amendment introduced at Committee Stage. Several employer representative bodies  raised difficulties that could arise if this provision remained part of the Bill. I introduced an amendment at Report Stage to have the provision deleted from the Bill and this amendment was passed by the D&aacute;il.  </p><p>The Bill completed Report and Final Stage in the D&aacute;il on 12th July 2018. However, I am concerned that the Bill as amended at Report Stage in the D&aacute;il includes provisions which have the potential to significantly delay the progress of the Bill. This is because one opposition amendment in particular, which deals with false self-employment, could have far reaching implications for a broad range of stakeholders and needs to be subject to a thorough scrutiny and consultation process. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-04a.637.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018100400057#WRL03500"><p>The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;22.50 per week for 27 weeks (a total of &euro;607.50 each year) from October to April, to over 368,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;227 million in 2018.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance at an estimated cost of &euro;182 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. It is not means tested. DCA is not a primary Social Protection payment and people in receipt of DCA can be in full time employment. Therefore DCA itself is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.  However, income from DCA is disregarded for the purpose of calculating entitlement to fuel allowance and does not prevent a person in receipt of a qualifying payment from receiving fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Carers allowance and carers benefit are not qualifying payments for fuel allowance in their own right.  However, where a person is in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit in respect of a caree who is in receipt of a qualifying payment such as Disability Allowance or a State pension  - or their spouse/partner/child - it does not preclude one of them from receiving a fuel allowance in respect of that household, and the income from the carers payment is disregarded for means test purposes.</p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance, carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual respite care grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  </p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well.  They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person.  From October 2013 onwards, the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance. If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and fuel allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance then they will have to undergo a means test for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Any decision to amend the criteria for receiving fuel allowance would have to be considered in overall policy and budgetary contexts.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is often the case that new evidence is provided with an appeal and that, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.  This was the case in 37.1% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016, 37.6% of such outcomes in 2017 and 31.9% of such outcomes to the end of September 2018.</p><p>Where the decision was not revised by the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers and Designated Persons are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017. The corresponding processing times for the period January to September 2018 are 30.5 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.2 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. </p><p>Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p>Appeal Receipts and Percentage of Favourable Decisions of Appeals Finalised </p><p>2012 &ndash; 2018<table><tr><th><div> </div></th><th><div>Appeal Receipts</div></th><th><div>Appeals Finalised</div></th><th><div>Favourable Decisions</div></th><th><div>Appeals Disallowed</div></th><th><div>Withdrawn</div></th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>35,484</td><td>32,558</td><td>50.4%</td><td>42.6%</td><td>7.0%</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>32,777</td><td>38,421</td><td>55.0%</td><td>39.0%</td><td>6.0%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>26,069</td><td>31,211</td><td>56.5%</td><td>37.7%</td><td>5.8%</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>24,475</td><td>25,406</td><td>58.8%</td><td>36.1%</td><td>5.1%</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>22,461</td><td>23,220</td><td>59.2%</td><td>35.9%</td><td>4.9%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>19,658</td><td>18,980</td><td>60.1%</td><td>33.9%</td><td>6.0%</td></tr><tr><td>2018 (to 30/9/2018)</td><td>14,319</td><td>12,951</td><td>57.4%</td><td>37.0%</td><td>5.6%</td></tr></table></p><p>Appeal Processing Times 2012 &ndash; 2018<b></b><table><tr><th><div> </div></th><th><div> Average processing times (weeks)Summary Decisions</div></th><th><div> Average processing times (weeks)Oral Hearings </div></th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>27.8</td><td>39.5</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>25.8</td><td>33.9</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>21.1</td><td>28.6</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>18.1</td><td>25.5</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>17.6</td><td>24.1</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>19.8</td><td>26.4</td></tr><tr><td>2018 (to 30/9/2018)</td><td>25.2</td><td>30.5</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Such executive mayors could be either elected directly by the electorate or indirectly from among the elected members of the Council.</blockquote><p>In line with the PPG commitment to consider directly elected mayors in cities, the paper proposes that executive mayors, either directly or indirectly elected, could be put in place in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. A decision to establish the role of a directly elected executive mayor could rest with the electorate of the local authority through a plebiscite in each area.</p><p>The Government agreed in principle to the holding of plebiscites on directly elected mayors with executive functions for Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Galway City Council and Galway County Council (in anticipation of a full merger of those two local authorities in 2021) at the same time as the Local Government Elections in May 2019. This agreement is subject to the necessary legislative provisions being included in the Local Government Bill 2018 and the future submission of more detailed proposals on the plebiscites and the questions to be put to the electorate, as well as the specific powers to be given to mayors.  </p><p>The Government also noted the policy proposal to refer the issue of directly elected mayors for Dublin for more detailed consideration and citizen engagement by a Dublin Citizens' Assembly to be specially convened in 2019.  Further details in this regard will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

New buildings and extensions, for example, do not qualify, nor does the installation or renewal of buildings services such as heating and electrical systems or renovation in the redecorating sense. Works to preserve the historic fabric of the building, however, would be eligible for funding. The main schemes funded by my Department in 2018 are as set out below. While the closing date for the 2018 schemes has now passed, my Department remains in contact with local authorities throughout the year to ensure the best use of all funds under the schemes, including the reallocation of funds where, for example, projects do not proceed.</p><p>The Structures at Risk Fund (SRF) supports conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  I have allocated &euro;1.3m this year and 76 projects across the country have been approved for funding under the scheme.</p><p>The Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) is a scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures, designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m nationally for this Scheme in 2018 and 355 projects have been approved for funding. </p><p>Details of all of the projects awarded funding under both of these schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and on local authority websites.  Funding schemes for 2019 will be announced in November and, again, the local authority Architectural Conservation Officer is best placed to provide advice and assistance in the first instance.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website .</p><p>In terms of future funding, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years, and will include increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>
