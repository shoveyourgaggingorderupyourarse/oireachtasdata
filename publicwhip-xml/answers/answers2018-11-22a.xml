    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-22a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112200063#WRA00600"><p>The 9% VAT rate was introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative from July 2011 to December 2013 and was aimed at boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.  From Budget 2014 it was decided to retain the 9% rate to support the increased number of jobs, and latterly, due to the weakness in Sterling following Brexit.  It was for these reasons that I retained the 9% rate in last year&rsquo;s Budget. </p>  <p>  I also, however, made a commitment during last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill to undertake a comprehensive economic study of all aspects of the 9% VAT rate in order to better inform any decision in relation to the reduced rate going forward. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Review of the 9% VAT rate: Analysis of Economic and Sectoral Developments&rdquo; was published by my Department in July 2018.  In addition to assessing the relevance, cost, value-for-money, impact to date of the 9% VAT rate, the Review also looks at the estimated impact on the relevant sectors were the rate to be increased.  </p>  <p>  The Review found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes.  The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.  Growth is also expected to continue in the medium term. This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the 9% rate sector remains strong.  The Review concludes that the VAT rating applied to the tourism sector should not greatly impact demand or employment in the sector.  The Budget decision to increase the VAT rate was made following this analysis.</p>  <p>  With regard to the expected increase in Exchequer revenues in 2019 as a result of the Budget change, this is estimated to be &euro;466 million.  The VAT rate increase in tourist accommodation is expected to yield &euro;235m in 2019, restaurants are expected to yield &euro;191m, hairdressing is estimated to yield &euro;27m in 2019, bloodstock sales is expected to yield &euro;7m and cinemas and shows is estimated to yield &euro;6m in 2019.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-22a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112200063#WRA00900"><p>Solid Fuel Carbon Tax was commenced in May 2013 at a rate of &euro;10 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted when combusted, and was increased to &euro;20 per tonne in 2014. Approximately 75% of solid fuel carbon tax yield relates to coal. </p>  <p>  Annual net receipts for the tax amounted to &euro;23.5m in 2015, &euro;24.4m in 2016 and &euro;19.1m in 2017.  As of end October, receipts to date in 2018 amounted to &euro;19.9m.</p>  <p>  Revenue has responsibility for administering this tax and takes a risk-focused approach in its deployment of resources on compliance activities.  Solid fuel carbon tax is collected by Revenue on a self-assessment basis and compliance with the law is enforced using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes. Liable fuel suppliers must file a return and pay for each bi-monthly period by the last day of the following month. Where suppliers do not submit returns by the due date Revenue will issue an estimate of the tax due. If a taxpayer fails to pay the amount due, including any debt for which an estimate has issued, Revenue may refer the debt for enforcement action. This can include sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties. I am advised that, to date, Revenue has undertaken actions to enforce approximately &euro;640,000 of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax.  </p>  <p>  Under European Union Single Market constraints, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel. Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.</p>  <p>  As I, and my predecessor, have pointed out before, because of the price differential with Northern Ireland, the collection of solid fuel carbon tax is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State. This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities.  This regime, which imposes higher environmental standards on coal in the State than applies in Northern Ireland, enables local authorities to undertake enforcement action to prevent the sale or distribution of coal that does not meet our standards.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here.  I understand that contacts are ongoing with a view to undertaking a number of joint operations and to explore the scope for follow up action by Revenue in relation to persons found to be in breach of environmental regulations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-22a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112200063#WRA01100"><p>As the Deputy is aware, recommendation 26 of the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>calls for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation.  In this regard, one measure which the Working Group considered as part of the Report was the establishment of a dedicated team within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle insurance fraud based on the UK model which is funded by the insurance industry. At this juncture, there are no plans to amend the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group Report in relation to the issue of the establishment of a Garda anti-fraud unit.</p><p>I, as Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, have no role in relation to the parameters of a proposed Garda Fraud Unit or how it might be funded. I understand that, at this stage, the Garda Commissioner has yet to form a view on the recommendation, and that no proposal or recommendation has yet been submitted to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Charlie Flanagan, T.D.  It will then be a matter for Minister Flanagan, on foot of a recommendation from the Garda Commissioner, to decide whether the establishment of the proposed unit is something which should be pursued.</p><p>Aside from consideration of the feasibility of a fraud unit, there has been significant progress in enhancing the level of engagement and cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry.  Part of this arose from the Fraud Roundtable, which was hosted by the Department of Finance and which involved wide stakeholder consultation.  A key output from this process was the agreement of guidelines titled<i>&ldquo;Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;</i>, which were published on 1<sup>st</sup>October.</p><p>Another important output of this engagement is the commitment for the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing general issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud.  This enhanced cooperation, I believe, will be very important going forward in tackling the issue of fraudulent claims.</p></reply>

In that regard it is my intention that the proposed legislation will identify the legislative changes that are required to implement a customer centric culture and to enhance individual accountability. </p>  <p>  I have long been on the record as stating that there are cultural failings in the banking sector that must be addressed and I have recently spoken of the need to rebuild the bond of trust that has been sundered with society in the wake of the banking crisis. We, in Government, are supportive of measures to change behaviour and organisational culture within the financial sector, in order to keep the customer at the heart of its operations. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank's Section 6A Report on the culture and behaviour of the main retail banks was drafted in response to my request in November 2017.  The report published in July, puts forward proposals, to enhance individual accountability by way of Conduct Standards for all regulated financial services providers and the individuals working within them; a Senior Executive Accountability Regime; and enhancements to the current Fitness and Probity Regime. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s assessment of the report found that it is a detailed and considered analysis of culture within the banking sector. The report&rsquo;s recommendations are intended to drive positive changes in terms of wider banking culture, greater delegation of responsibilities, and enhanced accountability. The report importantly focuses on simplifying the taking of sanctions against individuals who fail in their financial sector roles.  </p>  <p>  These Central Bank proposals are being considered as part of the work of the Government's forthcoming Central Bank (Amendment) Bill.  Officials in my Department are engaging with the Central Bank and other stakeholders in order to provide for measures that are proportionate and effective to achieve the Government&rsquo;s objective of a sustainable, customer focussed, financial services industry.  Policy matters including how proposals may be implemented are currently being examined including an appraisal of international best practice. </p>  <p>  It is important that any proposals that are brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas adopt a strategic approach in proposing and bringing through legislation that allows the Central Bank and firms within the financial sector to drive the necessary changes in culture.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-22a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112200063#WRA01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 27 together.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is actively engaging in the Interdepartmental work on Brexit coordinated by the Department of An Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, in July 2018 the Government made a number of decisions in relation to preparations for a &lsquo;Central Case Scenario&rsquo;. This is the main scenario based on the UK leaving the EU on 29 March 2019 with a ratified Withdrawal Agreement to include provisions for the backstop arrangements for the island of Ireland; and for a transition period up to 31 December 2020, during which time the UK would uphold the entire EU acquis. </p>  <p>  In line with preparations for the &lsquo;Central Case Scenario&rsquo;, Revenue&rsquo;s Brexit preparedness and contingency planning encompasses the three key areas of staffing, ICT enhancement, and infrastructure. </p>  <p>  In September 2018, the Government approved the phased recruitment of 600 Revenue staff.  In response to an open recruitment campaign undertaken by the Public Appointments Service more than 3,000 applications were received. Since September 2018, 43 trade facilitation staff have been appointed by way of internal, interdepartmental and open recruitment. I am advised by Revenue that plans are fully on track for the first phase of 200 additional trade facilitation staff to be trained and in place, working on a 24 hour/7-day week basis, by 29 March 2019.  I understand that recruitment and training of the remaining 400 staff is set to progress on a phased basis during the transitional period up to the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017 provision was made for an additional &euro;2 million for ICT funding for Revenue and I am advised that this has been invested in scaling up their Customs ICT framework to deal efficiently with the increase in Customs declarations, post Brexit and that Revenue is confident that the enhanced IT systems will be capable of facilitating smooth and efficient trade flows post Brexit.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that Revenue chairs an inter-Departmental Group that was established to consider the adequacy of port and airport infrastructure post Brexit.  This Group has identified and agreed the detail of the nature and scale of facilities that would be required at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport.  I understand that OPW is now leading on engagement to ensure that the additional infrastructure is operational in a timely manner.</p></reply>

Following a competitive tender process, Indecon International Economic Consultants were appointed to carry out this analysis. The report of the CBA was published at Budget time in the Department of Finance Report on Tax Expenditures and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>In brief, the report finds as follows:</p><p><b>- Prices:  </b>While there may have been a very small increase in prices attributable to the introduction of the incentive, the primary driver of house prices remains the continued misalignment between demand and supply.</p><p><b>- Supply:  </b>The evidence suggests that following the introduction of the incentive there was a marked increase in supply which can be attributed in part to HTB.</p><p><b>- Affordability:  </b>The analysis also finds that availability of HTB has reduced the time to save for all claimants and improved the overall affordability of housing for these individuals.</p><p><b>- Benefit/Cost Ratio:</b>The analysis finds a benefit-cost ratio of 1.28 indicating a moderate positive effect for the incentive but note that if the price of new HTB units was to increase due to the incentive, the net benefit would be reduced. </p><p>The incentive is due to expire at the end of next year and will be subject to decision as part of Budget 2020.</p></reply>

I welcome the publication of the proposals which marks the start of an important debate on the future of the EU budget. The proposals come at a time of great change and adjustment for the EU; with new priorities (including migration, security, climate change etc.) and the departure of UK.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, with Ireland&rsquo;s growing prosperity we have moved from being a net beneficiary to a net contributor to the EU budget. As such, it is important that the next MFF be an appropriately sized spending plan for the EU27 in a post-Brexit era, and that it will be capable of meeting the priorities of the EU27. Negotiations on those priorities and how they should be funded will be complex.</p><p>Further, in relation to Brexit, given the UK&rsquo;s current status as one of the largest net contributors to the EU budget, Brexit will have a significant impact on EU budget funding and expenditure. Should the draft Withdrawal Agreement be concluded the UK Government will continue to make contributions into the EU budget for the years 2019 and 2020 as if it were a full member and to continue to pay a contribution during a transition period for a time thereafter<b>.</b>However, as the Deputy will appreciate, while the draft withdrawal agreement was recently published, these negotiations are still on-going, therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss those negotiations or the potential impact on Ireland's net contribution to the EU budget in detail at this point.</p><p>Finally, in relation to contributions for the years 2020 to 2023, as part of Budget 2019, my Department forecasted contributions of &euro;2.9bn, &euro;3.1bn, &euro;3.2bn and &euro;3.4bn respectively. However, it is worth noting that these forecasts are contingent on a number of variables, including updated GNI forecasts, the size of the overall EU budget for the year and other EU budget operational developments. As a result, all forecasts will be monitored and updated on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

It was further notified on 9 May 2018 that the liquidators of the insurance company Alpha Insurance A/S had filed a petition for bankruptcy.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that as Alpha Insurance A/S is a Danish based insurance firm, it is subject to prudential supervision by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, and therefore it had no role in this decision. The Central Bank has also informed me that Alpha Insurance A/S was selling non-life insurance policies, including structural warranty insurance, in Ireland through the broker network on a freedom of services basis and that it also operated in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom and Spain.</p>  <p>  As the structural warranty insurance was initially purchased by the developer, the residents of the impacted properties may wish to get in contact with the property developer in the first instance to see if alternative cover can be arranged. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, should there be a claim on the policy due to structural defects, the property developer should seek assistance from the Danish Insurance Guarantee Fund in the first instance. If such an application were unsuccessful, there may then be recourse to the Irish Insurance Compensation Fund to recover 65% of the cost of a claim, up to a ceiling of &euro;825,000 per claim subject to the particular circumstances of the claim and the relevant provisions of the Insurance Acts (1964).</p></reply>

CUAC remains an important advisor to me on strategic issues facing the sector. </p>  <p>  Since 2011 my Department has put in place a number of measures to assist the credit union sector, including the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions, introduction of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 and the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board which oversaw 82 restructuring projects involving 156 credit unions during its lifetime. </p>  <p>  More recently an Implementation Group was established to oversee and monitor the implementation of the CUAC Report&rsquo;s recommendations. The group is chaired by my Department and consists of one member from each of the representative bodies, one member from CUAC and a member from the Central Bank. This group is an important forum for key stakeholders in the sector and has submitted papers on long-term lending and consultation and engagement to the Central Bank. The Implementation Group is expected to issue a final report to me in December 2018. </p>  <p>  While there are challenges to returns arising from the low yield environment and low loan to asset ratios, the sector continues to show signs of improvement reflected in growth in new lending, delivering c. 35% of all unsecured consumer lending in 2017, a decrease in the level of reported arrears and an increase in reserves. Total assets have increased consistently for many years and currently stand at approximately &euro;17.5 billion. </p>  <p>  Business model development is another challenge and opportunity facing the sector and to this end the Central Bank has set up a dedicated Business Model Unit within the Registrar of Credit Unions and has developed initiatives such as the CEO forum to address key constraints to, and enablers for, business model development. Business model development is also a focus of the CUAC, and I have specifically requested the committee to review barriers to and supports for collaborative efforts as well as SME lending, linking with the outcomes of the Local Public Banking report.</p>  <p>  It should be recognised, however, that there are many positive developments taking place in the sector, led by Credit Unions and their representative bodies.  Next year will see around 50 large credit unions, encompassing almost half of sector assets, providing Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAs), a Central Bank-approved suite of services which includes personal current accounts, a range of payment services including debit cards, and overdrafts. </p>  <p>  2019 will also see a new regulatory framework for lending being introduced, which should materially increase the scope for credit unions offering mortgages to their members. The proposal would allow sectoral capacity of up to at least &euro;861m for mortgages, with this figure rising if Credit Unions are approved for higher limits.  To put this figure in context there is approximately &euro;165m of house loans currently outstanding within the credit union sector. This new lending framework, which is in a consultation process at present, follows the recent significant regulatory changes to the Investment Framework which includes provisions that would allow up to &euro;700 million of Credit Union investment for funding social housing. </p>  <p>  This Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and its priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall. The Government is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. Credit unions are member owned and it is these members, with support from their representative bodies, who ultimately are responsible for setting and implementing their own individual strategic plans, with appropriate support from Government.</p></reply>

These deductions are available to all taxpayers.</p>  <p>  The Chapter on the &ldquo;Management of high wealth individuals&rsquo; tax liabilities&rdquo; in the recent 2017 Annual Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) states that the effective tax rate for high wealth individuals (HWIs) is more than double the rate for all income tax payers. The Report also identifies that 83 HWIs had taxable income of less than the average industrial wage.  </p>  <p>  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners attended the Public Accounts Committee meeting on 15 November. During the detailed discussion with the Committee, the Chairman outlined the various lifestyle and wealth management features of HWIs. In relation to the 83 HWIs with taxable income of less than the average industrial wage, he outlined that this low taxable income is related to the circumstances of the individuals which includes: family members of HWIs (25); non-resident individuals (21); individuals no longer categorised as HWIs (17); entitlement to credits and reliefs (15) with the remaining individuals having low income in that year.  It is important to point out that the deductions claimed which lower a taxpayer&rsquo;s taxable income are legitimate credits against tax liabilities. The Chairman also assured the Committee that there is no evidence, and Revenue does not assume, that wealthy individuals are more likely to be tax non-compliant.  </p>  <p>  Measures were introduced in the 2006, 2007 and 2010 Finance Acts to restrict the use of certain tax reliefs and exemptions by high income earners. These measures ensure that these individuals have an effective tax rate of approximately 30%. The recent report on the &lsquo;Analysis of High Income Individuals&rsquo; Restriction 2016&rsquo; published by Revenue in September of this year shows that these restrictions impacted on 521 individuals in 2016 resulting in the collection of additional income tax of &euro;38.5m.</p></reply>

Any change to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach, beginning with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  The fiscal rules provide some scope for flexibility, where temporary deviations from the required budgetary adjustment are permitted, subject to strict conditions. There are also certain more explicit flexibility provisions within the rules. For instance, to facilitate public investment, increases in capital expenditure are smoothed over a four-year period, where only one-quarter of the increase is taken into account in the first year. </p>  <p>  The rules also allow for deviations in the event of specific unforeseen circumstances &ndash; to date this has primarily been employed by several Member States in respect of costs relating to the refugee crisis &ndash; and to finance structural reforms that improve the long-term sustainability of the economy.</p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that the provision of affordable housing is a top priority. The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan outlines the Government&rsquo;s strategy for tackling housing issues. By the end of 2018, over 70,000 housing solutions will have been delivered under Rebuilding Ireland. In addition, along with my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, I signed the Establishment order for the Land Development Agency on 13 September. The Agency will work to better coordinate State lands for regeneration and development in partnership with land-owning State bodies. </p>  <p>  Finally, a wide range of housing measures were announced in Budget 2019, which provides a &euro;2.3 billion investment in housing for 2019. This represents a 25 per cent increase on 2018, and is the most the State has ever spent on housing. To ensure that no one has to sleep rough in the winter, an additional &euro;60 million in capital funding was allocated for 2018, much of which will fund additional emergency accommodation. Budget 2019 provides a further increase of &euro;30 million for homelessness services, bringing the total allocation for 2019 to &euro;146 million.</p></reply>

Neither he nor the Central Bank can interfere in the pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases, particularly in relation to motor insurance.</p><p>Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which I chair.  Its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance </i>was published in January 2017 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out within an Action Plan. The Working Group continued its work throughout 2017 and subsequently published the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance </i>in January 2018. </p><p>Stakeholder consultation formed the foundation upon which the Working Group&rsquo;s two Reports and their recommendations were developed.  This consultation process undertaken by the Working Group involved a wide range of stakeholders representing the different voices within this sector, including representative bodies, the major individual motor insurance providers and interest groups.  The impact of excessive premiums being charged to consumers from all counties across the country was a feature of this engagement process with industry.  </p><p>In addition, my officials regularly raise specific issues affecting consumers across the country during their ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland, including within a sub-group formed to implement relevant consumer-focused recommendations from the Motor Report. </p><p>Furthermore, I have separately met with representatives from insurance companies and other relevant stakeholders in relation to a number of issues and the problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been discussed during these engagements.</p><p>Quarterly progress updates on the implementation of the Reports provide more detailed information on the implementation of each of the recommendations and actions.  The seventh quarterly update was published recently and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for October 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.9% since peaking in July 2016.  There was a drop of 9.1% year-on-year in October, the 19<sup>th</sup>consecutive month with a year-on-year reduction.</p><p>While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained with the result that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p></reply>

The purpose of the research was to examine the extent and variety of interest rate restrictions within the EU and further afield and to assess the appropriateness of introducing such a restriction in the Irish market, given its specific circumstances and financial environment.  The key report recommendations highlighted by the Social Finance Foundation are that an interest rate restriction should be introduced but that this is conditional on there being a reliable alternative for consumers who are able and willing to repay and that consideration should be given to increasing the statutory 1% monthly cap on credit union interest rates.  </p>  <p>  The report did not specify the type or level of interest rate cap that should be introduced.  Both the report and the Social Finance Foundation highlight that this and other issues should be the subject of further research. The Social Finance Foundation also advised that the only thing worse than high cost credit is no credit.  </p>  <p>  The Social Finance Foundation points out that the credit union movement is a viable alternative for the community currently serviced by licensed moneylending firms because of the Personal Micro Credit (PMC) Scheme that many of its members participate in.  It began as a pilot scheme, supported by Government, in November 2015.  Loans under the initiative are branded "It Makes Sense" loans.  The PMC Implementation Group was established to oversee and drive the implementation of the scheme through its pilot phase and subsequently through to implementation nationwide.  My Department is represented on the PMC Implementation Group, which is chaired by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that credit unions are independent and it is at management discretion if they sign up to offer the "It Makes Sense" loan to consumers.  Additionally Credit Unions can only lend within their common bonds.  Currently 47% of credit unions are involved in the PMC scheme and, therefore, only consumers within the common bond of these credit unions can avail of the &ldquo;It Makes Sense&rdquo; loan.  As a result the "It Makes Sense" loan is not yet available as a nationwide mainstream alternative of affordable credit for current users of licensed moneylenders. </p>  <p>  The report and its recommendations will be examined by my Department.</p></reply>

Therefore, any question of simplifying tax return obligations for any group of taxpayers is a matter for Revenue.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, I am assured by Revenue that it supports the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) sector by making it as simple and as inexpensive as possible for sole traders, partnerships and businesses to comply with their tax obligations. To achieve this ambition, Revenue has taken various initiatives over the last number of years to assist taxpayers in filing their income tax returns. For example, recent initiatives include:</p>  <p>  - prepopulating income tax returns with data already available through other sources to minimise the complexity of the return filing requirement and, </p>  <p>  - providing simplified and clear information, including instructional videos on the Revenue website, to support and assist taxpayers in completing the various components of the income tax return.</p>  <p>  Where a self-employed taxpayer has PAYE income and their self-employed income is less than &euro;30,000 gross and &euro;5,000 net, that self-employed income can be &lsquo;coded&rsquo; or taken into account in calculating their annual PAYE tax credits and standard rate band.  Those taxpayers can submit a shorter Form 12 tax return; online through PAYE Services in myAccount.</p>  <p>  Also, Revenue continuously consults with business representatives through various forums to identify further initiatives that can achieve tax filing compliance in the least obtrusive way possible. For example, Revenue has established Business Customer Panels to get feedback on its services from taxpayers and to receive suggestions for potential further improvement.</p>  <p>  Finally, while it is never possible to fully eliminate the requirements of meeting tax obligations, I am advised that Ireland compares very favourably with other countries in easing the administrative burden to the greatest extent possible. In this regard, the Deputy will be interested to note that Ireland is ranked in the &lsquo;PWC/World Bank - Paying Taxes 2018&rsquo; report as the easiest country in the EU in which to pay business taxes and 4th easiest worldwide. I commend Revenue for this achievement, which is testament to its ongoing efforts to make the tax system as easy as possible for citizens to comply with.</p></reply>

These concerns include the short term nature of the approach, the proposed move away from taxing profits to taxing revenues, the lack of a clear link between any new interim tax and evidence of value creation by digital business and the potential impact on international trading relations from the adoption of a unilateral EU initiative on digital tax.    </p>  <p>  While Ireland is among a number of Member States which object to the fundamental nature of the proposal, we are joined by a wider group which share our concerns on a series of technical issues yet to be resolved.  Unanimity is required among Member States before the proposal could be agreed.</p>  <p>  I recently reiterated Ireland's opposition to the proposal at ECOFIN on 6 November where I highlighted particular concerns I have regarding the negative consequences for Europe as a predominantly exporting bloc from creating a precedent of taxation at point of consumption rather than where value is created.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also recall that we discussed this proposal when I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach as part of Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2018.  During that debate, I acknowledged that the taxing landscape for digital companies is going to change. However, it is my strong view that if the EU were to unilaterally introduce a digital tax, it would undermine the international tax reform process and risks disrupting international trading relations.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been a committed participant in, and strong supporter of, tax reform efforts led by the OECD through the BEPS process. I believe the OECD offers the safest and most effective way for delivering a sustainable solution to the challenges arising from the digitisation of the economy. Intensive work is underway at the OECD and it is expected that the next significant update will be published in June 2019.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to actively engage with work in the area of the digital economy at both OECD and EU level.</p></reply>

In addition, under Section 6 of the Statutory Declarations Act 1938, it is a criminal offence for a declarant to make a statutory declaration which is false or misleading in any material respect.

It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.   The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, requiring relevant firms to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits .</p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated loan owners are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  </p>  <p>  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort.  Borrowers who engage with their lender, therefore, benefit from the protections afforded under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). </p>  <p>  Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrowers and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  During the legal process, borrowers have opportunities to re-engage with lenders to find a solution.  In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting people in mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and there are a range of supports and services in place to assist people in that regard, including the Mortgage to Rent scheme; the personal insolvency system; and the Abhaile service which funds borrowers access to regulated financial or legal professionals. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I am unable to interfere with any commercial decision of a financial entity and so I cannot comment specifically on whether institutions should be doing debt write-downs.  However, I do think it is important to note that the review published last week of the Central Bank's Report on the Effectiveness of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears in the context of the Sale of Loans by Regulated Lenders states that for borrowers who engage with the process, the CCMA is working effectively and as intended.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore the Central Bank have stated that they will continue to assertively supervise regulated firms' compliance with the CCMA, track how long and short term arrangements are being applied to borrowers over time and that although strategy, commercial decisions and contractual rights of regulated entities cannot be interfered with, the Bank will investigate any patterns of behaviour it becomes aware of that suggests the CCMA is not being followed.  The Central Bank will also engage with industry on providing fuller information to borrowers on the assessment of their case in relation to arrangements being considered or not.</p></reply>

These measures will take effect from 1 January 2019.  </p>  <p>  The rate of betting duty at 1 per cent on the amount of bets wagered in Ireland is at an all-time low, and betting duty receipts are exceptionally low when compared to other sectors subject to excise taxes. It is also the case that there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. With the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 now well embedded in, I believe it is timely to increase the rates of Betting Duty and Betting Intermediary Duty.</p>  <p>  I am familiar with arguments put forward by the betting sector regarding the impact of the increase in betting duty. I acknowledge that advances in technology have challenged existing business models and have changed the structure of many markets, including the betting market, with more betting taking place online. I further acknowledge that smaller bookmakers may have ongoing difficulties competing in that environment or indeed with large retail bookmakers. While I have sympathy for small bookmakers I cannot apply the increase to some bookmakers and not others. Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters.    </p>  <p>  I should point out that my Department held a consultation with the sector last year asking if the current model was appropriate and the overwhelming response was that it was. The main focus of the sector's engagement during this consultation was to oppose any increase in the betting duty, which leaves me with few options in this regard other than to impose a straight forward increase in the current regime. </p>  <p>  Finally, we must also acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers. This needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting such rules.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of policyholders or particular products.  </p>  <p>  Having said that, because of the very specific and sensitive nature of your question, I believe that it is important to get greater clarification of how this matter is handled by the Industry. Therefore, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland seeking information on the general approach taken by insurers in Ireland in relation to suicide clauses.  However, due to the very short turnaround time for response to your question, Insurance Ireland were not in a position to provide any perspective on the policies adopted by insurers on this issue.  Instead, it has been agreed with Insurance Ireland that they undertake a survey of their members to clarify what their current practice is regarding this matter.  Once this exercise has been completed and appropriately considered, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy will write to update you on this matter as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Credit Servicing Firms are required to obtain authorisation from the Central Bank in order to conduct credit servicing activities as defined in the 2015 Act.  As a result, all firms who either currently operate in this area or intend to operate in this area (and meet the definition of a Credit Servicing Firm) require authorisation by the Central Bank.</p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including the CCMA.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is supporting Deputy Michael McGrath&rsquo;s Private Members Bill requiring the regulation of loan owners.  My Department have worked closely with Deputy McGrath to make the Bill more effective. <i>The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2018 </i>was considered by the Select Committee on 12 July and it is expected that Report Stage will take place today.  Finally, it is important to note that the review published last week of the Central Bank's Report on the Effectiveness of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears in the context of the Sale of Loans by Regulated Lenders states that for borrowers who engage with the process, the CCMA is working effectively and as intended.</p></reply>

It also expects that key ECB interest rates will remain at present levels at least through mid-2019. </p>  <p>  The winding down of the APP could potentially affect economic activity across the EU through the impact it may have on bank lending, the cost of sovereign funding and market liquidity, which will need to be monitored.</p>  <p>  While not possible to predict the future path of ECB monetary policy or interest rates, guidance from the ECB suggests that monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative for some time yet. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is likely aware, the most recent Economic and Fiscal Outlook published by my Department includes an assessment of the impact of policy rate tightening which sets out that the changing stance of monetary policy is a downside risk to the global economic outlook.</p>  <p>  However, the negative impacts of tapering are expected to be limited.  This view is supported by recent outturns in the euro area which showed steady growth of 1.7 per cent year-on-year, confirming the broad based expansion in the euro area despite weakening foreign demand.  Flash estimates from Eurostat also concur with this view. My Department will continue to monitor developments and advise accordingly.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has also been contemplating the ending of QE since it commenced.  Through taking pre-emptive action - including the early repayment of loans, and the early buyback and switching of near-term maturing bonds for longer maturity bonds - it has significantly improved our debt redemption profile and lowered our interest bill.</p>  <p>  The NTMA expects to end this year with over &euro;13 billion in cash to pre-fund ahead of larger bond redemptions. Relative to other sovereigns, Ireland has been particularly pro-active in taking advantage of the highly accommodative interest rate environment of recent years in order to pre-fund.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 (Act 21 of 2018) was signed into law in July this year. The Act, inter alia, provides for the payment of 100% of the compensation due to Setanta third party personal injury motor insurance claimants including the additional 35% to those who have settled their claims and have already received compensation of 65% of their claim.

The next application to the High Court will be subject to a three-month rule so will be late February 2019 at the earliest.

From Budget 2014 it was decided to retain the 9% rate to support the increased number of jobs, and latterly, due to the weakness in Sterling following Brexit.  It was for these reasons that I retained the 9% rate in last year&rsquo;s Budget. </p>  <p>  I made a commitment during last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill to undertake a comprehensive study of all aspects of the 9% VAT rate, in order to better inform any decision in relation to the reduced rate going forward. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Review of the 9% VAT rate: Analysis of Economic and Sectoral Developments&rdquo; was published by my Department in July 2018.  In addition to assessing the relevance, cost, value-for-money, impact to date of the 9% VAT rate, the Review also looks at the estimated impact on the relevant sectors were the rate to be increased.  </p>  <p>  The Review found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes.  The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.  Growth is also expected to continue in the medium term. This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the 9% rate sector remains strong.  The Review concludes that the VAT rating applied to the tourism sector should not greatly impact demand or employment in the sector.  The Budget decision to increase the VAT rate was made following this analysis.</p>  <p>  With regard to the expected increase in Exchequer revenues in 2019 as a result of the Budget change, this is estimated to be &euro;466 million.  The VAT rate increase in tourist accommodation is expected to yield &euro;235m in 2019, restaurants are expected to yield &euro;191m, hairdressing is estimated to yield &euro;27m in 2019, bloodstock sales is expected to yield &euro;7m and cinemas and shows is estimated to yield &euro;6m in 2019.</p></reply>

Since the most recent outbreak of conflict in 2015, over 50,000 people have been killed and more than 7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition.  While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay.  Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.</p><p>Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan.  In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan.  On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement.  Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019. </p><p>Our Embassy in Addis Ababa which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation.  She plans to visit again next week.  </p><p>Two Departmental officials have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, which is working to support the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. Ireland also cooperates closely with other EU member states on the issue of South Sudan in the European Council where Conclusions on South Sudan were adopted in April.</p><p><b></b>The EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, appointed in 2012,<b></b>contributes actively to achieve lasting peace, security and development in the region; this month he visited Dublin to brief the T&aacute;naiste on current dynamics in the Horn of Africa, including South Sudan.</p><p>Ireland is responding to the continuing humanitarian need in South Sudan, with over &euro;61 million in humanitarian assistance provided since 2012.

The reports of violence, arbitrary detention, and persecution of civil society leaders, peaceful protesters and those who have assisted them paint a troubling picture of repression. I once again strongly condemn any use of violence and reiterate my calls on all actors to respect the right to peaceful protest and to freedom of expression. I also call on authorities to ensure full accountability for all acts of violence, while ensuring due process for all prisoners.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers and the worrying accounts they contain of a pattern of human rights abuses and repression. Compounding this climate of impunity is a lack of official cooperation with the international missions investigating human rights abuses.  </p>  <p>  The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was expelled from the country following the publication of its report. The Group of Independent Experts (GIEI) and the Follow-Up Mechanism of Nicaragua (MESENI), set up by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR), have also both reported difficulties in working with the authorities. I urge the Government of Nicaragua to allow the OHCHR officials to re-enter the country, and to cooperate fully with the GIEI and MESENI, so that they can effectively carry out their important work. </p>  <p>  Ireland regularly engages on this issue at EU and international level. The EU and its Member States, including Ireland, calls on the government of Nicaragua to act on the findings and recommendations by the IACHR and OHCHR, to ensure full accountability for perpetrators of human rights abuses and the disarming and disbanding of armed groups. </p>  <p>  Ireland also supported the declaration in October by the EU High Representative on behalf of the EU on the situation in Nicaragua.</p>  <p>  The statement expressed the EU&rsquo;s serious concern at the situation, and urged the government of Nicaragua to allow the return of the OHCHR to enable it to continue its mission, as well as calling on the government of Nicaragua to stop the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators, halt arrests based on laws which criminalise peaceful protest, allow free peaceful demonstrators and re-establish the full respect of due process for all detainees. </p>  <p>  I echo the EU call on the government of Nicaragua to resume the national dialogue. I believe that inclusive dialogue remains the only way of negotiating a peaceful and democratic resolution to this crisis, and of restoring the trust of the Nicaraguan people in the country&rsquo;s institutions. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports EU action taken to support international and local initiatives to address the human rights situation, promote a culture of peace, and to provide support to victims of the crisis and their families. It is important to monitor the humanitarian consequences of the crisis and its impact on the population.   Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in our Embassy in Mexico, which has responsibility for diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, have been monitoring the situation closely. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, Valdrack Jaentschke, was met by officials in my Department on 1 October last and was informed of our strong attachment to the European Union position on Nicaragua. He was also advised of the importance we attach to the establishment of a genuine national reconciliation process. </p>  <p>  We have been engaging regularly with partner organisations on the ground, and raising the issue at international level where appropriate. Ireland greatly values the work of these partner organisations and will continue to engage with them.</p></reply>

Our priority now is to work towards the finalisation of that draft Withdrawal Agreement and the political declaration on the EU-UK future relationship. However any Brexit scenario will mean considerable change and impact for Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning for Brexit was initiated well in advance of the UK referendum in June 2016 and my Department has been to the fore in producing and funding a number of economic assessments on Brexit, both before and since the UK&rsquo;s referendum decision in June 2016, all of which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The regular updates of my Department&rsquo;s macroeconomic forecasts, as part of the Budget process, analyse the impact of Brexit on the Irish economy. My Department&rsquo;s forecasts in Budget 2019, published last month, assume, as a central scenario, that the UK will make an &lsquo;orderly&rsquo; exit from the EU. This involves a transition period being agreed between 2019 and 2020, and a free trade agreement thereafter. This feeds through to our fiscal projections. </p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit on Irish output is outlined in Box 5 in the Budget 2019 Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In this box my Department sets out the potential economic impact of a central (&lsquo;orderly&rsquo; exit) scenario and an alternative (&lsquo;disorderly&rsquo;) exit scenario. This shows that under the central scenario, after five years, the level of Irish output would be close to 2 per cent below what would be the case under a no Brexit baseline. There is of course still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the post-exit arrangement. Under the &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; exit scenario, the level of Irish output would be around 3&frac14; per cent lower than under the no Brexit baseline.</p>  <p>  With regard to the long term impact, joint research by my Department and the ESRI published in 2016 shows that the potential impact of a hard Brexit is significant.  After ten years the level of output would be almost 4 per cent below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario. The level of employment in Ireland would be 2 per cent lower, with the unemployment rate nearly 2 percentage points higher. </p>  <p>  I should also point out that the Department of Finance has been to the fore in producing and funding a number of Brexit-related studies, both before and since the UK's referendum decision, covering overall macroeconomic and sectoral impacts. </p>  <p>  It is important to stress that the economic models may not capture the full impact, given the difficulty in modelling financial market effects, non-tariff barriers and other factors. Therefore, these quantitative effects should be seen as a minimum as opposed to a maximum impact.</p>  <p>  While it is still Government&rsquo;s view that a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; outcome remains unlikely, we are planning for all scenarios. It is imperative to boost the resilience of the Irish economy in order to minimise, in so far as is possible, any future disruption. Since the UK referendum in 2016, all of our national Budgets have been framed to prepare for the challenge of Brexit. The economic and fiscal policies, which we have pursued, mean that the economy is now in a better position to weather the impacts of Brexit.</p></reply>

HWIs have been managed by dedicated units within its then Large Cases Division since it was established in 2003. Revenue recently split its Large Cases Division into two divisions, one of which is now focused on HWIs, avoidance and pensions. I am advised by Revenue that one of the current criteria to be considered a HWI, and come within the management of its Large Cases HWI Division, is to have net assets of over &euro;50 million.  </p>  <p>  The new Division is in the process, as reflected in one of the recommendations in the Annual Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG), of reviewing the case base with a view to increasing the number of HWIs managed in the Division. As part of this review the threshold of &euro;50 million in net assets will be re-assessed to identify the most appropriate threshold. I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s structural realignment is also being supported by an expansion in the number of specialist and experienced staff assigned to the oversight of the new Division&rsquo;s case base. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue is independent in its administration of the tax and duty system. I am advised by Revenue that cases not previously or currently meeting the criteria for inclusion in its Large Cases Division were and are subject to ongoing risk evaluation and, where necessary, intervention programmes. This applies to all taxpayers including those not within the responsibility of the Large Cases HWI Division. For example, I understand that Revenue has  established a new Medium Enterprises Division to manage the affairs of the tier of cases, both corporate and individuals below the Large Cases Division.  This Division has a branch which will focus on wealthy individuals that fall within its case base.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should be aware that measures were introduced in the 2006, 2007 and 2010 Finance Acts to restrict the use of certain tax reliefs and exemptions by high income earners. These measures ensure that these individuals have an effective tax rate of approximately 30%. The report on the &lsquo;Analysis of High Income Individuals&rsquo; Restriction 2016&rsquo; published by Revenue in September of this year shows that these restrictions impacted on 521 individuals in 2016 resulting in the collection of additional income tax of &euro;38.5m.</p></reply>

Based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation was just 0.3 per cent in 2017, this marked the fifth consecutive year in which inflation has been below 1 per cent. The subdued level of inflation has continued into 2018, with average inflation of just 0.7 per cent in the first ten months of the year. By contrast, inflation across the euro area accelerated to 1.7 per cent over the same period. </p>  <p>  The divergence between inflation in the euro area and Ireland can in part be attributed to the impact of euro-sterling appreciation on consumer prices in Ireland. In turn this reflects the importance of the UK as a source of imports of consumer products, which have fallen in price recent years as a result of the appreciation. </p>  <p>  While overall inflation has been subdued, services inflation has been relatively robust, averaging 1.6 per cent in the first ten months of the year. One important factor driving the increase in services inflation is strong growth in residential rents. Annual rent inflation averaged 6.4 per cent in the first ten months of the year. </p>  <p>  The pace of growth in rent prices, which in part reflects the ongoing shortage of housing, is a concern. Although rental market policy is primarily the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, the rapid growth in rents has implications for the macroeconomy and as such my Department continues to monitor inflationary tendencies in the residential rental market on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary response to mitigating rental inflation is to increase the supply of residential property. &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rsquo; sets out a comprehensive package of actionable measures designed to restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium. The construction sector is expanding strongly, and this is now feeding into the growing supply of residential property. New house completions in the four quarters to Q3 2018 are up 33 per cent to 17,161, while planning permission for 26,855 new units was granted in the four quarters to Q2 2018, up 39 per cent year-on-year. Over time, the growth in housing supply will mitigate the pressure on residential rents.</p></reply>

Public announcements to establish or expand operations have already been made by a number of companies. The Government  will continue to leverage our IFS2020 Strategy to maximise those opportunities and to drive growth in the IFS sector.</p></reply>

The guidance is provided in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). As part of the Semester process, the Commission makes country-specific recommendations to provide tailored policy guidance to each EU country on how to boost jobs and growth, while maintaining sound public finances. Following the economic crisis, budgetary surveillance was enhanced with the 'Six-Pack' and 'Two-Pack' regulations which seek to complement the European Semester through enhanced monitoring and surveillance of the fiscal policies of EU Member States. </p>  <p>  Following exceptionally strong growth in both the EU and the euro area in 2017, the broad based expansion is continuing in 2018 albeit at a slower pace, given the weakening in foreign demand. The latest estimates from Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, show that the euro area economy increased by 1.7 per cent in Q3 2018 compared to a year earlier. Growth continues to be steady due to the strength of domestic consumption and investment.</p>  <p>  However, the European Commission&rsquo;s Autumn 2018 Economic Forecast highlights that downside risks have increased of late, and dominate the outlook. Uncertainties continue in relation to the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU, escalating trade conflicts, geopolitical tensions, and changing global financial conditions. These risks require policy action that my fellow Finance Ministers and I are committed to addressing. At a global level, we must safeguard the open, rules-based, global trading system which has been associated with strengthening macroeconomic stability and raising living standards throughout the world. In Europe, we continue to make progress on developing Economic and Monetary Union, in particular through working to complete Banking Union, to reduce uncertainty and enhance financial stability. In addition, national authorities must implement prudent fiscal policies to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth for all.</p></reply>

As I outlined in Budget 2019, my Department has forecast GDP growth of 7.5 per cent this year and 4.2 per cent in 2019. </p>  <p>  This growth is expected to be broad based, with both domestic demand and net exports making positive contributions. Indeed, modified domestic demand, which strips out some of the volatile components  of demand associated with the activities of multinationals, is forecast to grow by 5.2 per cent this year and by 4.1 per cent in 2019. </p>  <p>  In the subsequent years (2020-2023), GDP growth is expected to average just under 3 per cent annually, broadly in line with potential growth. These forecasts take into account our central scenario with regard to Brexit, namely that a transition period will be agreed that extends or replicates existing frameworks until end-2020, in other words, the UK is assumed to remain in the single market and customs union until that point. From 2021 onwards, the baseline forecasts assume that the EU and UK will conclude a free trade agreement. This is expected to lower the level of GDP by almost 2 per cent over the period 2021-2023, relative to a baseline scenario of no Brexit, which is accounted for in my Department's forecasts. </p>  <p>  As well as Brexit, there are a number of other external risks I am monitoring closely. These include a disruption to world trade due to protectionism, a faster-than-expected normalisation of monetary policy, and policy changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, the best means available to me to mitigate these risks is to continue careful management of the public finances, and improve the resilience of the economy, including by implementing competitiveness-oriented policies.</p></reply>

The biggest such risk is a continuation of the present situation, in which supply falls significantly short of demand. If left unchecked, this shortage could increase affordability pressures, damage our competitiveness and harm our ability to attract investment. Due to the seriousness of the issue, housing supply is specifically listed as a domestic macroeconomic risk in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook published as part of Budget 2019. As such, it is accorded the highest priority within my department and in government more generally. </p>  <p>  In response to this challenge &mdash; and in addition to the measures being implemented by my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government under &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland&rsquo; &mdash; Budget 2019 contained initiatives aimed at increasing the supply of new homes. In 2019, a total capital investment of &euro;1.4 billion will be made in housing.  A further investment of &euro;310 million over three years will be made for delivery of affordable homes through the Serviced Sites Fund. Budget 2019 builds on actions taken in Budget 2018, which included the creation of Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), increases in the Vacant Site Levy and an increase in the rate of non-residential stamp duty. </p>  <p>  The only long-term solution to inflation in both the owner-occupier and rental markets is to increase supply. Recent figures on new home completions released by the Central Statistics Office, show that we continue to have significant year on year increases. New home completions increased by 33 per cent in the 4 quarters to Q3 2018, to 17,161. Statistics on planning permissions and commencement notices are similarly positive. Planning permission for 26,855 new units was granted in the four quarters to Q2 2018, up 39 per cent year-on-year. Commencement notices &ndash; a measure of housing starts - increased by 20 per cent in the 12 months to August 2018, to 20,371. The Department of Finance will continue to monitor developments in the housing sector in the context of maintaining our strong economic growth.</p></reply>

The economy maintains this competitiveness today. Ireland&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator, a widely-used measure of competitiveness published by the Central Bank, has improved by approximately 21 per cent since its peak in 2008. </p>  <p>  It is important that we preserve this competitiveness to facilitate continued growth. The recovery in the economy has not yet translated into a material rise in inflation. As measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), inflation has averaged just 0.7 per cent on an annual basis thus far in 2018.</p>  <p>  As outlined in my Department's recent economic forecasts, published with Budget 2019, the domestic economy is expected to be a driver of growth over the medium term. This could place upward pressure on prices and wages and lead to a reduction in competitiveness.</p>  <p>  To avoid this, we must focus on maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies and prudent fiscal policy. As announced, the Government will achieve a balanced budget in 2019. We are also increasing public capital investment via the National Development Plan to further build capacity within the economy. This will address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the economic recovery, for example the need for residential development and public infrastructure investment.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor all developments related to competitiveness to avoid complacency and continue to achieve balanced growth.</p></reply>

Furthermore, it remains important for consumers to shop around when it comes to premium renewals.</p></reply>

This growth is expected to be broad based, with both domestic demand and net exports making positive contributions. Indeed, modified domestic demand is forecast to grow by 5.2 per cent this year and by 4.1 per cent in 2019. </p>  <p>  As a barometer of how well our economy is preforming, there is no story more positive than the one emanating from our labour market, with more people working in our economy than ever before. In addition, further output growth should continue to pay dividends in the labour market next year, with over 60,000 jobs likely to be created and an unemployment rate converging towards 5 per cent. </p>  <p>  In an EU context, Ireland remains one of the fastest growing Member States. The strong growth and performance seen in our economy is also clearly illustrated by a comparison with the performance of our main trading partners &ndash; the euro area, the UK and the US. Following stronger than expected growth last year, the pace of expansion in the euro area and EU economies is expected to ease. For the euro area the Commission is forecasting growth of 2.1 per cent this year, moderating to 1.9 per cent and easing further to 1.7 per cent in 2020. For the UK, modest GDP growth of 1.3 per cent is expected this year slowing slightly to 1.2 per cent for both 2019 and 2020, based on a technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK. The US economy continues to benefit from several tailwinds, supporting GDP growth of 2.9 per cent this year, although this is expected to moderate to 2.6 per cent next year and to 1.9 per cent in 2020. In common with Ireland, there has been a recovery in employment growth in all our main export markets &ndash; though at a more modest pace &ndash; with a corresponding reduction in unemployment.</p></reply>

I am aware that there have been some recent updates to Revenue&rsquo;s concessionary flat rate expenses regime.</p><p>In the first instance, it is important to note that there has been no change to the general rule set out in legislation that says that all employees are entitled to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer.  </p><p>Revenue are independent in the administration of the tax code and the flat rate expenses regime is an additional concessionary practice operated by Revenue where both specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 TCA 1997 is satisfied. </p><p>The purpose of the regime is to simplify administration where the specific legislative criteria is met to help both the taxpayer and Revenue, by making it easier for large groups of employees working in the same sector to avail of their entitlement to tax relief in respect of expenses incurred in the performance of their employment duties. </p><p>The flat rate expense is agreed following engagement between Revenue and the relevant representative body for the particular group of employees who incur the same expense. This regime developed incrementally over the last 40 to 50 years, and currently incorporates some 53 employment categories covering broadly 134 individual flat rate expenses. </p><p>Given the historic nature of some of the flat rate expenses and having regard to changes in employment circumstances, regulations and work practices across employments, Revenue commenced a comprehensive review in 2018 of flat rate expenses. The rationale for the review, which is in line with best practice and good corporate governance, is to ensure the expenses agreed are still justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices and are in accordance with the legislative requirement for deduction as set out in section 114 of the TCA. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that a flat rate expense can only be retained where the legislative basis underpinning the deductibility is supported and they have engaged with relevant representative bodies in cases under review.  A consequence of the review by Revenue may be an adjustment to the quantum of the flat rate expense (either increased or decreased) or it may be withdrawn where the continuation is no longer justified.  I understand that engagement is on-going in relation to some existing and new categories of flat rate expenses, which is likely to either result in an increase to the existing amount or a new category agreed with Revenue. </p><p>The flat rate expense categories initially selected by Revenue for review in 2018 were based on a combination of two factors, the quantum in terms of number of claimants and the value.  Revenue has advised that they intend to have their review completed by the end of next year. Therefore, in the interest of fairness to all sectors and employees currently benefiting from the regime, Revenue has decided that the effective date for implementation of any changes to particular flat rate expense categories will be deferred until 1 January 2020, prior to which the review of all the flat rate expenses operating in the various employment categories will be completed. </p><p>The flat rate expense categories listed in the following table will be withdrawn with effect from 1 January 2020:<table><tr><th>Flat Rate Expense Category</th><th>Flat Rate Expense Amount </th><th>Number of recipients in 2018</th><th>Total gross value of Flat Rate   Expenses -  2018</th></tr><tr><td>Agricultural Advisers</td><td>&euro;671</td><td>122</td><td>&euro;81,862</td></tr><tr><td>Cardiac Technician </td><td>&euro;107/&euro;212</td><td>881</td><td>&euro;177,535</td></tr><tr><td>Journalist in employment</td><td>&euro;381/ &euro;153</td><td>8,134</td><td>&euro;2,255,910</td></tr><tr><td>Professional valuer in the Valuation Office</td><td>&euro;680</td><td>42</td><td>&euro;28,560</td></tr><tr><td>Freelance actors in employment</td><td>&euro;750</td><td>682</td><td>&euro;511,500</td></tr><tr><td>Shop Assistant</td><td>&euro;121</td><td>75,822</td><td>&euro;9,174,462 </td></tr></table></p><p>More generally, I am informed by Revenue that it is estimated that the total number of PAYE workers who benefit from the flat rate expenses regime in 2018 is in the order of 536,000.  I am also informed by Revenue that a breakdown of the cost and numbers by reference to each industry in which the flat rate regime currently operates is not readily available.  It is not possible for Revenue to accurately quantify the tax saving/cost associated with the withdrawal as it depends on the particular tax circumstances of the individual recipients, for example, the extent of their income subject to tax and whether income is subject to tax at the standard or marginal rate. However, in the context of their ongoing review of the flat rate regime, Revenue has undertaken to provide a sectoral breakdown.</p><p>Finally, Revenue has advised that withdrawal of a flat rate expense does not impact on a taxpayer&rsquo;s statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent to which the expenses are not reimbursed.</p></reply>

Following GDP growth of 7.2 per cent in 2017, GDP is forecast to grow by 7.5 per cent this year. While the GDP figures can be misleading in an Irish context, a broader range of measures including labour market and tax revenue developments confirm the economy is performing strongly. </p>  <p>  Despite the rapid rate of growth, the main indicators of an overheating economy &ndash; for instance the growth in wages, prices and credit - do not yet suggest that overheating pressures have emerged. </p>  <p>  The strength of the economic recovery has perhaps been most clearly evident in the labour market. Since the low point in 2012, close to 400,000 additional jobs have been created. As a result there are now more people in work than ever before. Importantly employment growth is broad based, with growth recorded in 10 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO. Despite the improvements in the labour market, there remains some slack in the economy for employment to increase further. </p>  <p>  Importantly the recovery in the economy has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. For the first ten months of the year, inflation, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), averaged just 0.7 per cent on an annual basis, this follows five consecutive years in which inflation has been below 1 per cent. Although price pressures have emerged in both the housing and the rental markets, this reflects the undersupply of housing over the last number of years, rather than evidence of over-heating pressures.</p>  <p>  In relation to credit growth it should be noted that lending to Irish households only turned positive during the second half of 2017 after several years of contraction. Safeguards are now in place to help prevent a reoccurrence of the unsustainable build up in credit, most notability the macro-prudential regulations introduced by the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  Over the coming years, our economy is expected to move towards full employment. As such, it is important that we remain cognisant of the upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, which could give rise to a loss of competitiveness. While the economy is expected to continue to grow strongly, such pressures in the economy may give rise to imbalances over the medium term.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, we will continue to focus on maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies and building capacity within the economy. In particular, we are now investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the economic recovery, such as the need for residential development and public infrastructure investment.    </p>  <p>  The Government will also continue to implement budgetary policies designed to enhance the resilience of our public finances. As set out in Budget 2019, we will &lsquo;balance the books&rsquo; next year and are currently establishing the Rainy Day fund. This prudent approach to our public finances will help to mitigate against any future downturn in economy activity.</p></reply>

No. 464 of 2015).</p>  <p>  As stated in the statutory Review of the Protected Disclosures Act completed in July 2018, consideration will be given to requiring the private sector to establish internal procedures in the context of the negotiation of the EU Directive on whistleblowing  (&ldquo;Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of persons reporting on breaches of Union law&rdquo;) which was published in April 2018.  This Proposal, as it is currently worded, contains requirements for private sector entities above certain thresholds to establish internal channels and procedures for reporting and following up on protected disclosures.</p></reply>

For example where a number of students have professional reports indicating they require the support of a special class.</p><p>Before approaching a particular school to request the establishment of a special class, SENOs take into account both present and future potential need within the area and must be satisfied that the class is sustainable and appropriately located. </p><p>The NCSE's planning for future projected need for special class provision in all areas of Co.

This review is currently underway and covers both the content of RSE curriculum and support materials, as well as the delivery of the curriculum to students. </p><p>Included in the areas for particular consideration during the review are:  </p><p>- Consent, what it means and its importance </p><p>- Developments in contraception</p><p>- Healthy, positive sexual expression and relationships</p><p>- Safe use of the internet</p><p>- Social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem</p><p>-  LGBTQ+ matters.</p><p>Given the scope of the request, the review will comprise of three inter-related dimensions: </p><blockquote>1.  Desk-top review of recently published research/studies in this area.<br /><br />2.  Consultations with key individuals and organisations who have responsibility for or who are working in this area.<br /><br />3.  Working directly with schools to examine the experience of RSE in schools and in classrooms.</blockquote><p>A review of research was commissioned in June 2018 and a report was published this week.  Studies have emerged over the last months that will also support the development of discussions and key questions in the review.  </p><p>A number of consultative events are being planned.  The first will be held on 27 November at Collins Barracks, Dublin and will involve approximately 60 groups and organisation who have expressed an interest in or who are known to have an interest in contributing to the review.</p><p>Approximately 20 primary and post primary schools, representing a range of school types and experiences will be directly involved.  The outcome from this strand of the review will inform recommendations in relation to curriculum gaps, implementation barriers and enablers, and support needs.  Furthermore, there will be an opportunity for any school to be involved, should they wish, to facilitate workshops locally.</p><p>The timelines for the three dimensions of the review are likely to intersect somewhat but will also contribute and add to the progression of the review.  I expect to receive a report from the NCCA in Q2 2019.</p></reply>

My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed. </p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: </p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools </p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools </p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.</p><p>While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Dunshaughlin school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>. The Education Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President on the 18<sup>th</sup>July 2018, is an important piece of legislation which will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015. </p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission (MHC) and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing. The Steering Group meets approximately once a month to monitor progress. </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service (DSS) to begin. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016 . The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to advise in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.  The multi-disciplinary group has been set up and work is ongoing on the code of practice on advance healthcare directives. </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. The Director of the DSS is working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the DSS can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations. </p>  <p>  Every effort is underway to ensure that the DSS has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the DSS has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in early 2020, the situation will be kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.   </p>  <p>  In April 2018, the MHC engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service. The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework. </p>  <p>  The MHC has in recent weeks received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff for the DSS and also a number of staff to provide shared services for the MHC and DSS. The MHC proposes to recruit these staff on a phased basis between now and 1 January 2020. </p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority is currently finalising its work on the suite of draft codes of practice in relation to non-healthcare matters which are required to be prepared under section 103 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  </p>  <p>  In June 2018, my Department recruited an external legal expert to assist in the preparation of draft regulations in relation to decision-making assistance agreements, co-decision-making agreements, certain matters relating to decision-making representatives, and enduring powers of attorney.  These regulation-making powers are provided for in sections 10(4), 31, 45(3), 45(4), 46(3) and 79 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. Work on the draft regulations is ongoing. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Budget provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.   </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

These letters do not seek any information which the Department already has and any additional information sought is necessary to process the applications in as timely a fashion as possible.  Further, the letters to the women concerned make it clear that any further relevant information sought relates to work in the laundry in as much detail as they can remember.  </p><p>The Addendum provides that the first phase of processing a completed application is the making of a provisional assessment as to whether the applicant comes within the scope of the scheme.  This assessment will be made based on the records of the institutions concerned (where available) and any other relevant records or statements, which  may include the applicant's testimony and in some cases testimony from other persons.  Each application will be assessed individually on its merits.  On this basis, a decision will be made as to whether on the balance of probabilities the applicant comes within the scope of the scheme. In addition, for those cases where there is insufficient documentary evidence available to make an assessment on their case, an interview process is in place so as to facilitate a fairer assessment of a woman's application.  </p><p>In relation to the age at which a girl started work in a Magdalen laundry,  the information contained in the McAleese Report relates only to girls and women admitted to the Magdalen Institutions. The McAleese Committee did not conduct any research into the adjoining institutions which are now covered by the Addendum.  The statistical analysis carried out by the Committee indicated that the average age on entry into the Magdalen Institutions was 23.8 years of age and the median age was 20 years of age.  While the youngest entrant was identified as 9 years of age, this had occurred in the 1930s.  The McAleese Committee's analysis also shows that only 4.1% were under 14 years of age at the time of entry.  As stated in the Addendum, it is open to an applicant to show that she worked in a Magdalen Laundry before she reached 12 years of age and, where shown, such work would be included in the calculation of the 'work' element of the lump sum.  </p><p>It is assumed that the details requested by the Deputy in relation to age, hours worked and the records of the religious congregations returned to the Department, relates to records received by the Department in processing applications under the scheme established in 2013 for those women who were admitted to and worked in a Magdalen Institution. The only criteria relevant to calculating the lump sum payable to successful applicants under that scheme is as set out by Judge Quirke in his report on the scheme of compensation for the Magdalen women.  Those criteria are (i) that the applicant had been admitted to and worked in the Magdalen Institution and (ii) the length of stay in that institution. Therefore the only information required from records submitted by the relevant religious congregations are the entry and exit date for the applicant.  Records as to the age of the applicant while in the Magdalen Institution or their hours of work were not relevant to the calculation of the award.  Applicants to the scheme are asked to provide supporting documentation and, where it is necessary and the applicant has consented,  the religious congregations provide records to the Department. It should be noted that the religious congregations co-operated fully with the Department in the administration of the scheme and provided records where requested.  </p><p>In relation to the McAleese inquiry which preceded the Quirke report and the establishment of the ex-gratia scheme, the religious congregations also cooperated and provided access to their archives.  When the McAleese report was finalised and published, the records provided by the congregations were returned to them and they are not part of the State archive.  Chapters 5 &amp;amp; 12 of the McAleese Report detail the research undertaken on the legislation and regulation of  employment, factories and the workplace.</p><p>Chapter 6 of the McAleese Report sets out the approach in relation to the archive.  The McAleese Committee agreed that the archive be deposited and stored centrally with the Department of the Taoiseach, noting the approach taken in relation to archiving set out in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.</p><p>The Committee decided that the archive contains only copies of state records, in order to avoid disturbance to or destruction of original or archived files. The originals of all such records identified &ndash; many of which were already archived, and some of which are covered by the National Archives Act 1986 - will remain in their original files and locations. </p><p>There are no plans at this stage to provide access to the McAleese archive at this time.</p></reply>

As such, the presence of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in each other's jurisdictions takes place in the context of the on-going co-operation to keep all communities on this island safe.  The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the only police service empowered by statute to exercise policing and security services in the State and, in accordance with the law, to engage in co-operation with other police services in this regard.</p><p>The two police services have for many years operated a joint <i>Cross Border Policing Strategy,</i>the overarching purpose of which is to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island of Ireland.  The Strategy covers the range of policing activities and contains a series of initiatives in which both police services are actively engaged and which will go towards fulfilling its objectives.  A good practical example of on-going co-operation is the Annual Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime, the most recent of which was held in County Down on 7 November.  The Conference brings officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI together to enhance co-operation between all law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border under the shared objective of combatting organised crime.</p><p>Close police co-operation on this island across the full range of policing responsibilities will continue regardless of the final shape of Brexit.  I would emphasise that it is the Government&rsquo;s firm intention that the same border arrangements as currently apply on the island of Ireland will continue.  In its approach to the Brexit negotiations, the Government has ensured that protecting the gains of the peace process and the avoidance of a hard border are the highest priority for Ireland, our partner Member States and the European Commission.  I have discussed this matter with my counterparts in the British Government and I know that protecting the gains of the peace process are a clear and shared objective.</p></reply>

These supports aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months.</p>  <p>  For 2019, I have allocated an extra &euro;8 million to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, which work with firms to develop their supports for business. I have also allocated an additional &euro;5 million to the local enterprise offices, LEOs, for 2019 to increase their Brexit supports to businesses in every county.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019 as a Brexit support measure for Irish businesses.  The Scheme will make up to &euro;300 million funding available to eligible Irish SMEs, including those in primary agriculture, to support them to strategically invest over the long-term.  It will provide low cost loans for terms of between 8-10 years, which is not readily available on the market.  </p>  <p>  This will complement the Brexit Working Capital  Loan Scheme which was launched in March this year, making a fund of up to &euro;300 million available in the form of low cost loans of up to 3 years for eligible businesses to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenge. So far, there have been 304 applications to the scheme, with 265 approved by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Office funding has been increased by  22%, and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating. The suite of LEO Brexit supports includes tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online "Brexit SME Scorecard" to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and a "Be Prepared Grant" to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK. </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland's Brexit advisory service was established in May 2017 to provide a focal point for SMEs working to navigate the changes in cross-Border trading relationships brought about by Brexit negotiations. To date, the Brexit advisory service has engaged directly with more than 2,350 SMEs in Ireland through the various elements of the service. I have allocated an additional &euro;1 million to InterTrade Ireland for 2019 to increase the impact of its Brexit support for businesses.</p>  <p>  As part of awareness-raising activities, EI has rolled out regional Brexit Advisory clinics throughout the year.  My Department and its agencies have also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready roadshow to inform businesses of supports available to them to prepare for Brexit.</p></reply>

This Act was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act. Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contain provisions relating to the regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures carried out in the State, including dealing with the rights of children born as a result of those procedures. There are important administrative and operational arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the implementation of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3, including the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register and the appointment of authorised persons under the Act.

The Act sets out criteria for medicine reimbursement decisions.  </p><p>The 2013 Act requires the HSE to have regard to both clinical benefits and cost effectiveness, but it does not provide for a different rule set when assessing orphan drugs. It would take an act of the Oireachtas to change the current assessment process for medicines. However, both the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) and the HSE are mindful of the differences and challenges in terms of patient numbers when assessing this type of medicine.</p><p>The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention. </p><p>There has been substantial engagement between the Department, the HSE and the NCPE over the last number of months, which has resulted in a number of key changes in the HSE medicines assessment process, within the confines of the 2013 Health Act. </p><p><b></b>In June 2018, the HSE leadership appointed a Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases, which is responsible for:</p><p>1. Reviewing proposals received from industry or expert groups in Ireland for funding of new products for rare diseases or expanded indications for existing products for rare diseases and making recommendations on the implementation of the relevant recommendations from the National Rare Diseases Plan 2011-2018; and</p><p>2. Contributing to the development of clinical guidelines for relevant orphan medicinal products (OMPs) and supporting the implementation of guidelines with the National Drugs Management Programme Office where applicable.</p><p>The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations for reimbursement of OMPs are not intended to replace any part of the existing medicines appraisal process, but rather to complement it. </p><p>The Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases is intended to provide greater balance and transparency to the assessment process. The inclusion of two public or patient representatives, from a selected panel of three, recognises the value of having patient representation on the Committee. As well as examining the methodologies for assessing orphan drugs, the Committee will also consider the views of patients, caregivers and the wider issues that go into health technology assessments. </p><p>This Committee is operational and has already completed work in relation to orphan products.</p><p><b></b>The composition of the HSE Drugs Group has recently been expanded to include two representatives from the National Patients Forum and more clinical expertise in the area of rare diseases.</p><p>In light of these developments, I do not propose to bring forward proposals to change the assessment criteria for orphan drugs, which would require  the approval of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

The changing demographics and the implications for future health care costs underpin the importance of developing a wider choice of appropriate housing options for older people suited to their needs.  The aim is to encourage and facilitate timely planning by older people and to rebalance the care model away from residential care to supporting older people to remain living independently at home for longer.  As the research shows, this reflects the preferences of older people themselves. </p>  <p>  The aim is to ensure that older people will have more choice by developing a range of housing options that are suited to their needs, so they can plan ahead and, insofar as possible, choose the right option for them. These options may include retirement villages, housing with supports projects or other initiatives. </p>  <p>  Varying levels of support will be needed to enable older people to continue living in their own homes and communities, including care needs where appropriate. However, it is envisaged that there will always be a cohort of people for whom residential nursing home care is the most appropriate option. The main issue is the significant gap in alternative or intermediary options. This is the issue that I wish to address. There is a significant need to put in place suitable options to give older people the choice and importantly, to ensure that care is provided in the most appropriate setting. This aligns with the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare where there is an overarching aim to bring care closer to the community and the person's home. </p>  <p>  The Capacity Review published earlier this year, in addition to recognising the pressures being faced across the health system in terms of access to healthcare, was also an indication of the Government&rsquo;s desire to plan appropriately for the future. Analysis of future scenarios (based on demographic projections and taking account of envisaged reform measures) shows potential requirements for the period to 2031. On the back of these findings, the Government committed to providing 4,500 additional short and long term residential care beds in the National Development Plan. The exact criteria for the planning and design of these beds will be evaluated on a phased basis as the projects are approved.   </p>  <p>  Currently more than 23,200 people are supported in nursing homes under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. This figure does not include those in short stay or transitional care beds. The Health Information &amp;amp; Quality Authority website has information on the number of registered beds for each designated residential care centre, public and private.</p>  <p>  On November 20 I hosted an expert conference on housing for older people with my colleague Mr. Damien English T.D. Minister for Housing and Urban Development. The overwhelming outcome of the event, shared by the experts, was that choice and the development of a range of community supports and services in close proximity to older people is the key to achieving the objective of keeping people living longer and independently in their communities. The outcome of this conference will be used by my officials and officials of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to inform the development of a suitable policy framework for housing for older people.</p></reply>

The HSE in turn have advised that in late October 2018, an error was discovered in correctly communicating a genetic test result by the Department of Clinical Genetics at Our Lady's Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) following an enquiry by an oncologist for a patient with recurring cancer who had a genetic test, known as a BRCA test, in 2009. Crumlin Hospital are currently reviewing this incident as a matter of the utmost priority.</p>  <p>  This error has been reported as an incident and is being managed in accordance with the HSE Incident and Risk Management policy, including in commencing an incident review process of this transcription error in correctly communicating the test result in a letter to the referring clinician. Direct contact has been made with the patient involved in this incident, with an offer made for an Open Disclosure meeting to take place at the discretion of the patient.</p>  <p>  As a precaution, OLCHC has also instigated a review of the communication of all BRCA test results since 2006, firstly prioritising the 335 positive BRCA results processed by the Department of Clinical Genetics. This review of the correct communication of the positive BRCA test is currently underway and is expected to be completed in the forthcoming days. The hospital will then review the correct communication of the negative BRCA tests.</p>  <p>  For the sake of clarity, I would also like to stress to the House that there is no concern regarding the accuracy of the BRCA test itself. The error which has occurred  relates to the correct communication of the test result.</p>  <p>  A dedicated contact helpline has been set up  at OLCHC to assist patients with concerns. It is in operation from Monday to Friday, 9:00am-5:30pm. Patients wishing to contact the helpline should phone (01) 4096219.</p></reply>

The report made several recommendations, the vast majority of which focused on the internal team working and clinical governance issues at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children's Hospital Crumlin. The report resulted in 56 actions to be undertaken by the HSE and Crumlin Hospital. The HSE has confirmed that 31 of these actions have been implemented and 16 are currently being implemented.  </p>  <p>  An external multi professional team, led by an experienced NHS UK Health Manager, has been assisting the Department of Clinical Genetics at Crumlin to deliver an improved service for patients and clinical service users. There continues to be investments in the recruitment of extra staff resources and the purchase of new equipment to assist with the implementation of improvements to the service.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Donnai-Newman Report was that a Steering Group should be set up to develop a National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network  that reflects best international practice. This Steering Group was established by the HSE in early 2015. Their report  included recommending the appointment of a National Director of the National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network and a Clinical Laboratory Director. The HSE National Service Plan 2018 includes a commitment to commence development of the National Genetics and Genomic Network. These key posts, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, will inform the development of the national strategic direction for genetic and genomic medicine services, including genetic services.</p></reply>

Ireland will again be a central player in that process.  However, I am firmly of the view that now is not the time to commence our internal EU27 consideration of a review of the CFP.   We must instead concentrate all our efforts on the ongoing Brexit negotiations until we have clarity on the exact nature of the future relationship with the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  The discussion on the post Brexit CFP will undoubtedly occur in earnest once the overall future relationship and its impact for fisheries is clear.

The methodology applied to apportionment is based on the UK's share of total Union imports under the TRQ over a recent representative three-year period (2013-2015). This usage share is applied to the entire scheduled TRQ volume to arrive at the UK&rsquo;s share of a given TRQ. The Union&rsquo;s share then consists of the remainder of the TRQ in question. This means the total volume of a given TRQ is not changed. The full product list including the EU share in quota is contained in the Regulation Annex.</p>  <p>  Ireland has actively engaged with the discussions to date at EU level.  Ireland prioritises the need to minimise disruption to trade as the UK leaves the EU and the importance of maintaining the existing levels of market access, which is also the intention of the European Commission.  Ireland was one of a number of Member States who sought to enhance the consultation requirements for the European Commission with Member States in the apportionment process and we were successful in that regard. This provides us with assurances that any unintended consequences of the proposed approach, given the fluidity of the overall Brexit process, will be discussed by Member States at the relevant Committee, in particular, the Trade Policy Committee.  </p>  <p>  Following bilateral engagement with a number of WTO Members as well as exchanges at the Committee on Market Access on 9 October 2018, the EU submitted a revised set of data on 19 October 2018. The EU is ready to engage in negotiations as soon as possible and has invited Members to submit their claims/revised claims without further delay. </p>  <p>  As appropriate, my Department will be liaising closely with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which has lead responsibility on this issue.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-22a.568.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112200072#WRK03700"><p>Ensuring that we have a supply of housing that is affordable for people to buy or rent, depending on their choice and circumstances, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  The underlying factors driving house prices now are fundamentally different from those which drove prices leading up to the financial crisis: current pressures in the housing market reflect a shortage of  supply to meet the present demographic demands for housing, whereas previously credit was one of the primary factors contributing to house price inflation.</p>  <p>  The credit environment now is markedly different. There is now an enhanced regulatory regime in place to monitor and manage risks to the economy emerging from the housing sector. The Central Bank's macro prudential rules, which are working effectively, aim to increase both bank and borrower resilience and mitigate the risks of credit fuelled house-price spirals emerging.</p>  <p>  The availability of appropriate development finance for commercially viable residential projects has been identified as a key contributory factor to underpin further progress in addressing the shortfall in housing supply. The Government is meeting this challenge through the launch of Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) which will utilise up to &euro;750 million to provide debt funding for residential development, funding new housing construction across all regions in the country.</p>  <p>  In overall terms, the key elements of the Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing the issues in our housing sector are set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, and Project Ireland 2040, which sets out a comprehensive set of measures designed to address the on-going structural constraints within the construction sector and restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium.  The CSO&rsquo;s most recent Residential Property Price Index , published on 14 November 2018, shows a moderation in house price growth rates; in the year to September 2018, residential property prices at national level increased by 8.2%, compared with an increase of 8.9% in the year to August and an increase of 12.0% in the twelve months to September 2017. In Dublin, residential property price growth continued to moderate, with an annual increase of 5.8% in the year to September 2018.</p>  <p>  Increasing housing supply, however, is the most important element of our response to the housing crisis.  In that regard, the most recent data show the continuation of some very positive trends:</p>  <p>  -  Planning permissions (Q2 2018) granted up 39% year on year;</p>  <p>  -  Commencement notices (August 2018) up 20% year on year;</p>  <p>  -  New homes available for use (Q3 2018) up 20% year on year;</p>  <p>  -  Registrations (July 2018) up 7% year on year.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to address affordability specifically.  In particular, for those households earning low to moderate annual gross incomes (up to &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants), a multi-stranded approach is being taken to the targeted delivery of affordable housing.</p>  <p>  In order to support the affordable housing programmes of local authorities, the Government has committed &euro;310 million, over the three years 2019 to 2021, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) announced as part of Budget 2019. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. </p>  <p>  A first call for proposals under the Fund issued to the four Dublin local authorities; Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth and Cork County Councils, and Cork and Galway City Councils.  Fifteen proposals were received, from nine of the local authorities targeted under this first call and I expect to announce funding decisions in relation to these applications shortly. I expect infrastructure works on approved projects to begin as soon as possible thereafter and delivery of affordable homes from late 2019/early 2020 onwards.</p>  <p>  More broadly, all local authorities are carrying out economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites. My Department hosted a workshop for local authorities on 8 November to discuss these issues. </p>  <p>  A second call for proposals under the Fund will be made shortly. The scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities, as part of the aforementioned assessments, which they have been requested to submit by 30 November. </p>  <p>  In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, for example, under the recently commenced provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out further. The Regulations to support the operation of Part 5 will be finalised shortly. These initiatives complement other Government actions which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p>  <p>  Finally, the new Land Development Agency (LDA) will contribute significantly to the delivery of affordable housing. All of the State land developed by the LDA will include 40% social and affordable homes to purchase or rent.</p></reply>

In addition, under Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the Minister's power to issue policy directions and guidelines to housing authorities in relation to their housing functions should not be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned. As such, I am precluded from intervening in relation to individual cases.</p>  <p>  Under the Regulations that govern the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan it is a matter for each local authority to make the decision on loan approval applications. Each authority must establish a Credit Committee, in accordance with the  statutory Credit Policy, to consider these applications on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the recommendations of the assessment of applications undertaken by the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  The statutory Credit Policy also obliges local authorities to establish an appeals process to which applicants, who are dissatisfied with a decision of a Credit Committee, may appeal that decision.  It is therefore open to the persons referred to by the Deputy to make such an appeal. Details of the appeals process can be obtained from the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  In relation to the details supplied by the Deputy, I am advised that the relevant Local Authority has sufficient financial capacity to address the application referred to.</p></reply>

The results of each SSHA are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and include breakdowns by each local authority across a range of categories. The 2018 Report can be accessed at: www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/summary_of_social_housing_assessments_2018_-_key_findings.pdf.  The SSHA is a point in time exercise, with 11 June 2018 being the count date for the most recent report.  Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council reported 1,117 households on its waiting list at that time.</p></reply>
