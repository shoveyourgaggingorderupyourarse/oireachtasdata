    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-04-01a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021040100055#WRA00500"><p>I am acutely aware of the difficulties that the necessary ongoing Covid-19 restrictions are putting on businesses right across the country.  With this in mind the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest they contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID which I recently announced aims to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government&rsquo;s other existing schemes and is designed to help with fixed costs. </p>  <p>  Applicant businesses are required to operate from a building, or similar fixed physical structure on which business rates are payable. Where the rate account is addressed to a landlord for one or more tenant businesses the grant must be applied for and paid to the operating business in each case. The intention behind this provision is to assist businesses operating from fixed premises to meet some of the ongoing fixed costs of maintaining those premises.   </p>  <p>  The Government is very much open to proposals as to how we can help businesses further. However, our schemes are there to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided and to provide basic weekly income support up to maximum of &euro;350 per week. We are not providing compensation for loss of personal income above this level or compensation for loss of profits for any sector.</p>  <p>  The outdoor adventure industry is under the remit of my colleague, Minister Catherine Martin, in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media.  An allocation of &euro;55million was secured by that Department in Budget 2021 for a programme of funding under the strategic Tourism Business Continuity Scheme. The Scheme is designed to help strategically important tourism businesses through a direct financial contribution to support them with future operational and continuity plans. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is responsible for developing and administering the Scheme. Phase One of the Scheme, which ran from 11th February to 8th March, was open to outdoor activity providers. The process of payments to successful eligible applicants has commenced.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that all Business schemes are being reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

From time-to-time IDA seeks to expand its global network of offices and teams.  Many firms are looking to expand into new markets and Ireland is a proven location for global companies to grow and serve their customer base in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.</p><p>IDA Ireland has decided to tender for a part-time Israel based Business Development Consultant.  This person will represent IDA to support its efforts to win new investment. This is a model used across many territories.  The Business Development Consultant will be expected to identify Israeli-headquartered target companies with potential for investing in Ireland, engage with senior decision-makers in these companies and present Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition as an investment location.</p><p>IDA Ireland has advised my Department that as part of its normal evaluation and due diligence process across all regions, it considers many factors including societal and reputational risk, that could be associated with investment activities prior to accepting a client into its portfolio.</p><p>My officials have advised IDA of Ireland's well known position on the illegality of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, which informs our engagement with the State of Israel across a range of bilateral issues, including trade.  Ireland distinguishes between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967. </p><p>The EU and its Member States, including Ireland, are wholly opposed to Israeli settlements, which are contrary to international law, and are damaging to the prospects of peace.</p><p>UN Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted on 23 December 2016, calls on all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967. This Resolution reflected the position already held by Ireland, the EU and the UN for many years.</p><p>Ireland consistently raises human rights issues in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory at the highest international levels, including most recently at the 46<sup>th</sup>session of the UN Human Rights Council.</p><p>Ireland remains steadfast in its support for a comprehensive two state solution which protects the future of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.</p><p>As an Agency of my Department, I expect IDA Ireland to align with Ireland's position on this matter.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-04-01a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021040100055#WRA02000"><p>My Department has been engaged on the matter of the EU vaccination authorisation mechanism since the EU's initial Implementing Regulation (EU 2021/111) was adopted in late January, 2021. This Implementing Regulation sought to monitor vaccine exports from the EU to 3rd countries for an initial period of 6 weeks.  It was succeeded by Implementing Regulation (EU 2021/442) which extended the monitoring and authorisation period to 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has since adopted a third Implementing Regulation (EU 2021/521) which provides additional authorisation criteria that Competent Authorities within each Member State must consider when assessing any vaccine authorisation request received, including exports to 3rd countries with large vaccine manufacturing capacity and exports to 3rd countries with a higher vaccination rate than the Union, or where the epidemiological situation is less serious than in the Union. </p>  <p>  Export authorisation requests for vaccine exports are submitted to the Competent Authority where the vaccine or its active ingredients are manufactured. Currently, Ireland does not manufacture final vaccines for export, however, in fulfilment of our legal obligations, my Department's Trade Licensing &amp;amp; Control Unit has been designated Ireland's "Competent Authority".  </p>  <p>  Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, has been clear that the mechanism underpinned by the Regulation(s) is focused on export monitoring and transparency and is not designed to be an export ban. The export authorisation mechanism has been adopted to preserve the security of EU and global supply chains by introducing the principles of reciprocity and proportionality. The new legal act gives Member States the necessary degree of flexibility to authorise exports unless they cause concern, on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  The Commission has stated that the application of the authorisation mechanism should be carefully considered by the Competent Authorities, in conjunction with the Commission, to ensure that decisions are made in a balanced way in order to maintain complex supply chains while safeguarding the availability of vaccines for EU citizens on an equitable basis. Competent Authorities will assess the situation in the EU regarding Advanced Purchase Agreement (APA) commitments, but also the situation in the destination countries. It is also important to record that the most vulnerable countries, including least developed countries and dependent countries within the EU's geographic sphere continue to be exempt from the mechanism. </p>  <p>  The Commission is eager to ensure that EU citizens receive a fair share of vaccines, having regard to the Union's &euro;2.7b investment in vaccine development, and to invite other vaccine producing 3rd countries to open their own exports of vaccines. In this regard, I am pleased to record that export data resulting from the mechanism's monitoring function demonstrates that the EU is the main exporter of vaccines globally. Export figures up to 25 March 2021, show that 77 million vaccine doses were exported out of the EU since 1 December.  Moreover, virtually every application within the EU for an authorisation has been granted.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland supports the pursuit of open, free trade rooted in the multilateral, rules-based system and the WTO.  From first principles, we require a very high burden of justification for the introduction of any export monitoring or control measure.  We endeavour to ensure that when any such measures are introduced that they are very tightly focused and timebound. Ireland appreciates the highly integrated and global nature of supply-chains for vaccine manufacturing and the vital importance of unrestricted movement of goods to the viability of multinational manufacturing.  Accordingly, my Department will continue to advocate for the earliest feasible conclusion of the existing measures, which are currently designed to run until 30 June 2021, as well as for the highest thresholds of justification to be applied when assessing export authorisations received from industry.</p>  <p>  Finally, I might also note that in light of the worldwide need for vaccines in the context of COVID-19, the Commission is also working with industry to endeavour to ensure maximum manufacturing capacity is committed to vaccine production.</p></reply>

When the emergency measure ends eligible employees will be able to avail of their entitlement to make a claim for redundancy to their employer.</p>  <p>  Under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, it is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments to eligible employees, in the first instance. However in situations where an employer is unable to pay these entitlements due to financial difficulties or insolvency, an application for payment under the Redundancy Payments Scheme may be submitted to the Department of Social Protection. The Department can make the statutory redundancy payment to eligible employees on behalf of the employer.

The amount payable was based on the eligible business&rsquo;s turnover for a comparative period pre-pandemic.  Turnover provided an equitable proxy by which to calculate the costs which the business incurred, meaning that payments were commensurate with these ongoing costs.</p>  <p>  The SBASC was designed to provide assistance to those businesses who do not qualify for CRSS or other similar sectoral support schemes.  As SBASC is being administered by the 31 Local Authorities, a requirement was that the Scheme be straightforward to administer for both applicants and administrators alike, which is why a flat rate payment of &euro;4,000 for Q1 was decided on.  </p>  <p>  The first quarter payment for SBASC is specifically for businesses that are not in receipt of the CRSS during that period and under the terms of the it is not possible to receive both SBASC and CRSS at the same time. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall we announced at the time of the launch of the SBASC that these payments are not designed to compensate for lost income and are designed to ensure that assistance is provided for unavoidable fixed and ongoing costs to enable businesses to resume when restriction levels are eased.

A key action within the National Remote Work Strategy is to extend the mapping and classifications of hubs - as completed by Western Development Commission on the Atlantic Economic Corridor - across the country to develop national data on hub infrastructure. Enterprise Ireland is actively working to support the implementation of this strategy through:</p>  <p>  - mapping and classification of hubs;</p>  <p>  - mapping regional and local need to inform future investment in enterprise centres/hubs; and</p>  <p>  - investment in remote work hubs and infrastructure in under-served areas thus underpinning the development of the national hubs network.</p>  <p>  On 20 November 2020, I announced &euro;8.24m in grants for 95 Enterprise Centres around the country administered through Enterprise Ireland. The funding will ensure that the Enterprise Centres, many of which have been negatively impacted by COVID-19, can sustain their businesses, pivot and further develop their services to support the next wave of Irish start-up companies. Enterprise Centres provide important infrastructure for entrepreneurs and are an essential part of the start-up ecosystem across Ireland. The Centres, many of which are regionally based, provide space, mentoring and support to start-up founders and teams, helping them to scale internationally.</p>  <p>  To date, my Department has provided funding of &euro;250 million to support the establishment of approximately 270 enterprise centres throughout Ireland and administered by Enterprise Ireland. This investment has enabled the establishment of physical space for entrepreneurs, start-ups, scaling companies, SMEs and a balance of small scale FDI; delivery of enterprise relevant programmes to companies; and provision of physical space to support remote working.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, Enterprise Ireland has administered Departmental funding to 91 projects totalling &euro;16,434,595 under both the Regional Enterprise Development Fund and the Community Enterprise Centres Schemes. An emerging feature of projects funded under these schemes is the provision of physical space to support remote working.</p>  <p>  Currently there is an Enterprise Ireland open &lsquo;Regional Development Feasibility Fund&rsquo; that promoters, looking to scope out and investigate the viability of larger full-scale projects such as remote working hubs, can apply for. A feasibility grant of &euro;15,000 or 50% of eligible costs, whichever is lesser, is available to qualifying applicants meeting the required criteria.</p></reply>

The amount payable was based on the eligible business&rsquo;s turnover for a comparative period pre-pandemic.  Turnover provided an equitable proxy by which to calculate the costs which the business incurred, meaning that payments were commensurate with these ongoing costs.</p>  <p>  The SBASC was designed to provide assistance to those businesses who do not qualify for CRSS or other similar sectoral support schemes.  As SBASC is being administered by the 31 Local Authorities, a requirement was that the Scheme be straightforward to administer for both applicants and administrators alike, which is why flat rate payment of &euro;4,000 for the first quarter of 2021 was decided on. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the scheme it is not possible to receive SBASC for periods when businesses are in receipt of payments for CRSS. SBASC is available for Q1 2021 for those businesses that are not in receipt of the CRSS for Q1. </p>  <p>  As we indicated at the time of the launch of the SBASC, these payments are not designed to compensate for lost income but to make a contribution to fixed costs and to ensure that assistance is provided for unavoidable fixed and ongoing costs to enable businesses to resume when restriction levels are eased.  It is also important to note that CRSS has been available to eligible businesses since October 2020 and has included several bonus payments throughout that period, whereas SBASC will only cover the period since the start of 2021.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy, however, that all schemes for which my department is responsible are kept under constant review. </p></reply>

The long-term challenge for the sector is to fully contribute to achieving a climate neutral economy no later than 2050, while not compromising our capacity for sustainable food production. The Government is committed to finding the balance between environmental, climate and biodiversity needs and supports for farmers. </p><p>Measurement of agriculture and land-use emissions from each Member State is carried out on a consistent basis, which captures the individual characteristics of each Member State, including Ireland. </p><p>Article 13.7 of the Paris Agreement, of which both the EU and its Member States are signatories, requires signed parties to provide regular greenhouse gas emissions inventories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in order to track both a country&rsquo;s achievement of their nationally determined contributions and climate policies as well as regional climate policies, and the world's progress in limiting global warming. The UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories for Annex I Parties (which covers EU Member States) require that Annex I Parties should use the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories to measure emissions inventories. This ensures consistency of measurement across Member States. </p></reply>

Partial grants are available for individuals that can afford to contribute to the cost of upgrades as well as free energy efficiency retrofits for people at risk of energy poverty.  Since 2000, over 400,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.  The 2021 budget for SEAI residential and community schemes is &euro;221.5 million &ndash; the largest ever allocation for these schemes.</p>  <p>  SEAI grants encourage homeowners to reduce heat loss through the installation of insulation and ventilation in the first instance, before moving to replace heating systems. This is in line with the fabric first principle and best practice. </p>  <p>  Grants for residential pellet burning heating systems are not available as an individual measure.  However, grants for pellet burning stoves are available when included as part of a wider energy efficiency upgrade under the Community Energy Grant Scheme and the National Retrofit (One-stop-shop development) Scheme. Stoves installed must meet certain requirements and specifications.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years. Heat pumps are an attractive and extremely efficient alternative to stoves. Furthermore, heat pumps are very economical to run offering lower energy costs to homeowners as well as reduced carbon emissions.</p>  <p>  Outside of the residential sector, the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) has been developed to financially support and stimulate the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating and other non-domestic heat users not covered under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.  The SSRH, which is operated by the SEAI, provides an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems.  Eligible renewable energy technologies are supported through a multi-annual payment, for a period of up to 15 years, on the basis of prescribed tariffs.  The National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the roll-out of the scheme for the period up to 2027.  The introduction of the scheme provides an indirect stimulus to the indigenous wood pellet industry.</p>  <p>  Further information on SEAI grants is available at www.seai.ie/grants or by calling 1850 927 000.</p></reply>

This was an increase of approximately 7,000 tonnes on volumes collected in 2013.</p><p>The 2018 total included 30,000 tonnes mixed residual waste, 28,000 tonnes bulky waste, 18,400 tonnes garden waste, 15,000 tonnes wood and 8,950 tonnes metals. Hazardous waste, which includes items such as batteries, paints, inks, hydraulic or lubricating oils, aerosols and detergents, amounted to 2,200 tonnes.</p><p>All materials accepted at civic amenity sites are segregated at the point of deposition into the various waste streams. </p><p>- Municipal Waste Streams - The materials are shipped for processing at Material Recycling Facilities where they are baled for reprocessing. Any material not suitable for reprocessing (approximately 10%-20%) is prepared to Solid Refuse Fuel (SRF) specifications for use as a replacement fossil fuel. </p><p>- C&amp;amp;D Waste Streams - The materials are shipped to C&amp;amp;D sorting facilities where the streams are separated into their component parts. All the sorted material is recycled/recovered apart from C&amp;amp;D fines which is generally estimated at &amp;lt; 1% of the total stream and this is sent to landfill for disposal.</p><p>- Hazardous Waste Stream - Hazardous materials are packaged into UN containers on the civic amenity site and exported for recovery at waste to energy plants abroad.</p><p>- Compost Materials - All material is shipped for recycling to Compost and Anaerobic Digestion facilities in Ireland.</p><p>- WEEE - WEEE is collected for recycling /reuse by the Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) schemes. </p><p>- Reuse - The direct reuse of materials takes place at a number of civic amenity sites and consideration is being given to expanding this. </p><p>The Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy, which I launched in September 2020, contains a commitment to formalise the role of civic amenity sites and agree a standard list of waste streams to be accepted at such sites. In this regard the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices, with support from my Department, have recently published a National Review of Civic Amenity Sites, which is available online at:  . </p><p>Discussions have commenced with the local authority sector on implementation of the report recommendations.  This will allow civic amenity sites to play a greater role in our transition to a more circular economy through measures such as coordinated education and awareness programmes, greater uptake of reuse schemes, standardising a list of waste streams accepted at such sites and collective approaches to extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes, and this will assist in continuing our success in reducing the amount of waste disposed of at landfills.</p></reply>

One of these issues is connected to the primary legislative proposal to grant the Minister for Transport the power to revoke a driving licence, planned for inclusion at committee stage hearing of the Road Traffic Bill 2021. The Bill is expected to be introduced to the Houses shortly, after the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications has concluded pre-legislative scrutiny.

As a consequence, the service is closed while level 5 restrictions remain in place.  Customers who have a Driver Theory Test scheduled during the level 5 restrictions will be contacted to notify them that their test will be rescheduled free of charge when the service resumes. Updates around the resumption of tests will be published on www.theorytest.ie.</p>  <p>  The RSA is engaging with its service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints for when services resume. In this regard, the aim is to double capacity at test centres over a three-month period. Subject to decisions on future Covid 19 restrictions, this will mean that additional capacity would be made available in April, May and June 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased capacity initiative, the RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. The online service has been trialled on a pilot basis for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses and is now being evaluated with a view to extending the online service to all test types during 2021.  However, scaling up operations to facilitate higher numbers will take time to achieve.</p></reply>

This is an essential safety check and an important road safety measure that provides for a reduction in road accidents by detecting defects such as faulty brakes, worn tyres or defective headlights.</p><p>The applicable dates for periodic testing and voluntary testing is provided for by national legislation. Under Regulation 3(2) and 3(3) of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 415/2017), the initial test due date for a vehicle is determined using the date of registration of that vehicle and subsequent test due dates fall on anniversaries of that date.  Accordingly, all test due dates are predetermined based on the date of registration of a vehicle. It is important to note that the NCT certificate relates only to the condition of testable items at the time of the test and does not constitute a warranty for their condition for the subsequent 12-month period.  Any NCT certificate issued in respect of a vehicle is only valid up to the test due date that falls after that certificate was issued. </p><p>There are no current plans to amend this legislation in respect of test due dates. </p><p>I of course believe that safeguarding public health is of paramount importance at this time. I am advised by the RSA that the NCT Service has put in place a broad range of measures to ensure that they are compliant with health and safety guidelines and public health advice, including restricting the use of waiting rooms, and that this is notified to customers via the NCT website. I am also given to understand that the NCT Service has requested that elderly or vulnerable customers do not attend in person but instead arrange for someone to present their vehicle in their stead, where possible. Information about the protocols which have been put in place is available from the NCTS website  </p><p>It is also possible to call the NCTS booking number on <b>01-4135992</b>and speak to one of their representatives.</p></reply>

Details of the CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.</p><p>To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing its business premises.</p><p>To make a claim under the CRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made. </p><p>An eligible business can make a claim under the CRSS for a cash payment known as an &ldquo;Advance Credit for Trading Expenses&rdquo;. The cash payment will enable an eligible business to meet costs associated with its business premises, such as rent, insurance and utilities, at a time when, because of the specific terms of the Covid restrictions, it cannot, for a period of time, provide goods or services to customers or can only do so to a limited extent.  The cash payment will be equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000, for each week that the business is affected by the Covid restrictions. For a business established between 26 December 2019 and 12 October 2020, the claim will be based on the average weekly turnover of the business in the period between the date of commencement and 12 October 2020 (subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000).</p><p>The amount to which a business is entitled under the CRSS is based on turnover of the business rather than where the business is located, subject to the requirement that the business is located in a geographical region for which Covid restrictions are in operation.  All parts of the country are subject to the same level of Covid restrictions under current public health regulations. </p><p>Revenue has published detailed statistics on the main COVID-19 subsidy schemes since late March 2020, including the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS). These statistics are available on the Revenue website and are updated on a weekly basis at this link: .</p><p>The county breakdown shows that businesses from all counties are availing of the scheme and less than one quarter of the premises receiving CRSS support are based in Dublin.</p></reply>

Our current focus is on maintaining existing supports and ensuring that they continue to support those most impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>The Government has introduced a number of schemes to support individuals and businesses who have been impacted by the pandemic. Of the three primary schemes, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment has paid out nearly &euro;7 billion to individuals who have lost their jobs, the two Wage Subsidy Schemes have provided support of over &euro;5 billion to impacted businesses, and the most recent measure, the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme, has paid over &euro;400 million in direct support to firms that have had to close due to public health restrictions. </p><p>The public finances can absorb this shock.

However, the new agreement still represents a break from previously existing arrangements, and thus a permanent shock to the Irish economy. Therefore, Brexit will still have a negative economic impact on the Irish economy and living standards compared to the previous relationship.</p>  <p>  For Irish exporters, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is positive, compared to a no-deal scenario, as it will provide for zero-tariffs and zero-quota trade for qualifying EU and UK goods. However, it is important to note that the agreement does not completely mitigate against trade frictions in the form of non-tariff barriers, such as customs checks and procedures. So, while tariffs and quotas have been avoided for qualifying goods, non-tariff measures or non-tariff barriers represent a change in trading relations and an increased cost to trade. In addition, disturbances to retail and distribution supply chains could have a direct impact on Irish consumers through reduced competition and higher prices. Further import controls will be introduced by the UK, on a phased basis from October 2021, on certain categories of EU goods, including plant and animal products.  </p>  <p>  The Government has put in place extensive financial supports for sectors over recent years to assist businesses prepare for and mitigate the impacts of Brexit, including various financial, advisory, and upskilling supports. The Government has also invested heavily in our port infrastructure, as well as working closely with businesses to navigate the new customs arrangements.   A range of Government support is available to Irish exporters, including training and grants, to help businesses deal with these changes. It is vital that business prepare for the further changes which will arise over the coming months due to the UK&rsquo;s new import controls.</p>  <p>  The successful negotiation of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland, as part of the Withdrawal Agreement, delivered key economic objectives for Ireland. The Protocol secures Ireland&rsquo;s place within the Single Market, avoids a hard border on the island, protects the all-island economy, and provides Northern Ireland with unique access to both the British internal market and the EU single market.</p>  <p>  In the weeks since the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, a level of trade friction has been evident. Given the phased basis of the new import controls which are being applied by the UK, it will take time for these to feed through to overall exporting activity, and to assess any associated economic impact. </p>  <p>  The Government remains focused on protecting our economic and financial interests, and will continue to work to minimise the disruption that Brexit will have on the economy and peoples&rsquo; livelihoods to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

The <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform </i>sets out 66 actions in this regard across several policy areas, including my Department, with 95% due to be completed by the end of 2021. At its most recent meeting, the Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which oversees the implementation of the Action Plan, reflected upon the considerable progress made in the first three months of this year. Achievements include:</p><p>- The creation of an <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market </i>within the Department of Finance.</p><p>- The adoption of new <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines </i>by the Judicial Council.</p><p>- The launch of a public consultation on proposals to reform the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board</i>.</p><p>Priorities for the next three months include: strengthening the laws on perjury, expanding the National Claims Information Database so that it publishes its first report on employer and public liability insurance, and examining the Central Bank&rsquo;s final report on differential pricing so that we can respond accordingly. </p><p>A key action of the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda is the establishment of <i>The Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>within my Department, chaired by Minister of State Fleming. Its role is twofold: to assist in the reduction of insurance costs and the increase of the availability of cover, including for businesses, by promoting competition in the Irish insurance market. It will employ a strategic approach to the promotion of insurance competition, including encouraging transparency and championing the provision of information in relation to the insurance market and available products. Since its establishment, the Office has held a number of meetings with several important stakeholders, including representatives of the insurance industry and business groups as well as representatives of civic society to discuss consumer empowerment, and increasing provision of relevant information. It has also had useful discussions with other state regulators and the Central Bank on promoting competition issues. </p><p>The Action Plan also prioritises working to protect customers during and after the COVID-19 crisis. In our ongoing engagement with the insurance industry, Minister of State Fleming and I have repeatedly raised this issue and emphasised the importance of treating customers honestly, fairly and professionally. This has resulted in a number of insurers announcing forbearance measures and motor insurance rebates for customers. The industry&rsquo;s response to the pandemic will remain a feature of our future engagement, including at the upcoming meetings between Minister of State Fleming and insurers.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to engage extensively on this matter and monitor developments in the sector as the Government drives forward the insurance reform agenda. Minister of State Fleming and I look forward to continue working with colleagues and stakeholders to implement further aspects of the Action Plan, with a view to improve both the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups.</p></reply>

Strong rates of economic growth had been recorded for a number of years, the labour market was effectively at full employment, while surpluses were recorded on the current account of the balance of payments and the government budget balance. While the negative effects of Covid-19 and Brexit are significant, these factors support the enduring competitiveness of the Irish economy. </p><p>While the domestic sector suffered a severe hit last year, the multinational sector has proven resilient demonstrating the competitiveness of Irish exports on world markets. Indeed, the IDA&rsquo;s results for 2020 suggests foreign companies continue to value our FDI strengths. These include our talented and flexible workforce, a track record as a successful home to global business, and a hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction. </p><p>As the global economy is experiencing the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic in a reasonably symmetric way, Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness on the international stage is not expected to be significantly affected. As a result, the recent series of surpluses in Ireland&rsquo;s current account are expected to continue. The 2020 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Ireland as the 4th most competitive country in the EU and the 12th most competitive country in the world.  </p><p>In light of the vaccine rollout and the recovering international economy, the outlook for Ireland&rsquo;s economy over the short-to-medium term has improved. For instance, the EU Commission is forecasting GDP growth of around 3 &frac12; per cent this year and next. However, there is a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounding the short-term economic outlook. The pace and extent of any economic recovery this year will ultimately depend on many factors, including the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines can be rolled out, the time it takes to suppress the current surge of the virus, as well as the impact of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU on the Irish economy.</p><p>Equally, as a small open economy Ireland is particularly exposed to external risks, including the international development of the pandemic, the extent of permanent damage to the global economy &ndash; so-called &ldquo;scarring&rdquo; effects, as well as premature fiscal or monetary tightening. External risks will continue to be monitored carefully by my Department. </p><p>My Department will publish updated macroeconomic forecasts with the Stability Programme Update in April.</p></reply>

For example, the interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.65% in January 2021. </p><p>However, Irish mortgages can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries making the direct comparison of headline rates not fully consistent. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages such as:- </p><p>- credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p><p>- the level of non-performing and restructured loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks;</p><p>- there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions. </p><p>However, the Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p><p>The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. </p><p>Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for mortgages and other loans.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater benefits for borrowers.  </p></reply>

This work and engagement has sought to ensure that the sector is adequately prepared, and that financial services firms and market participants have contingency plans in place to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers, investors and markets as possible.On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that the financial services sector is well prepared and resilient enough to manage the changes associated with Brexit.  </p><p>Since the end of the transition period, my Department, the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA have been monitoring developments and activities in the financial sector and this monitoring will continue in accordance with their respective responsibilities.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the recent successful migration of Irish securities settlement, from the UK CREST system to Euroclear Bank Belgium. The UK decision to leave the EU precipitated the need to migrate the Irish system to an EU entity. This migration ensures that Ireland remains well connected into the heart of the EU&rsquo;s capital markets - with the stable investment and legislative environment that comes with that access and activity.</p><p>In addition to the financial services provisions included in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, both the EU and the UK agreed to establish a Memorandum of Understanding on structured regulatory cooperation on financial services. This is currently being progressed and it is a welcome measure which will support continued cooperation between the EU and UK in financial services.</p><p>The nature, scale and complexity of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector will change in a number of ways as a result of the financial services firms relocating from the UK as a result of Brexit and those looking to set up operations in the EU for the first time. The industry in Ireland has become broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than at any time.</p><p>The full impact of Brexit for Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector may not materialise for some years. At present, firms are establishing the foundations of a new or significantly expanded presence in Ireland, creating a platform for future growth opportunities in all sectors: insurance, banking, and investment management.</p><p>A number of government strategies have sought to grow the international financial services sector over the last number of decades, and these strategies were in place long before Brexit. The latest iteration of these strategies is &lsquo;<i>Ireland for Finance</i>, the strategy for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector to 2025&rsquo;. </p><p>The Government and various state agencies continue to implement that Strategy, (and indeed industry lead on some appropriate action measures under the annual action plans) and are working to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland&rsquo;s strengths as a leading financial services centre.</p></reply>

The outbreak of the pandemic turned the economy on its head in the space of a few weeks, with the introduction of Covid-19 restrictions resulting in a sharp contraction in domestic economic activity last year. However, in keeping with the pattern seen in other countries, the economy rebounded as restrictions were eased.</p>  <p>  My Department, along with the ESRI, conducted an analysis of the sectoral overlap between the Covid-19 and Brexit shocks to help us plan accordingly. The key finding of the analysis is that there is limited overlap of the sectors exposed to the different shocks. No sector was found to be severely affected by both shocks. While the analysis was based on the assumption of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit, this general conclusion is still applicable today.  Nevertheless, there still remains considerable uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook as it will depend on many factors, including the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines can be rolled out which is itself a function of supply. </p>  <p>  As the vaccine programme steps up throughout the second quarter this year and beyond, Covid related restrictions will gradually be eased and a sustained economic recovery can then take hold in the second half of the year. The recovery in the domestic economy should be supported by the release of pent-up demand financed by the unwinding of historically high levels of household savings. </p>  <p>  While the effects of Covid-19 have been severe, our resilience and strength comes from being an economy that remains open to investment and facilitates trade across our borders. This has proven to be the fundamental strength of the Irish economy over decades and is still the case today.</p></reply>

Indeed, over the last 4 years, over 20 taxation initiatives have been agreed by Member States through this voting process.  This is an average of one initiative being agreed every 3 months.  This includes important Directives on VAT, administrative co-operation, Anti-Tax-Avoidance and also the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions.</p><p>Given this impressive record of achieving agreement at EU level on tax issues, I do not see the need to move away from the requirement for unanimity, which has worked so well to date. For example, most recently,  the seventh iteration of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC7) to introduce new exchange of information provisions for digital platforms was only proposed by the Commission last July, agreed among Member States in December, and was adopted on March 22.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s tax sovereignty is an important issue for Irish citizens. In the run up to the Lisbon Treaty referendum, EU leaders made a public political commitment confirming that the Treaty did not impinge on Member States&rsquo; tax sovereignty, and I believe that this commitment was a significant factor in the people's decision to accept the Treaty.</p><p>The Programme for Government affirms that taxation is a national competence.  Ireland has been consistently clear that unanimity is the appropriate voting system for any tax proposals at EU level, and I am confident that this will remain the case.</p></reply>

As of January 2021, annual property price inflation stood at 2.6 per cent. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary response to mitigating residential price inflation is to increase supply. I am encouraged by the stability in new dwelling completions last year in spite of the challenges of the pandemic. According to the Central Statistics Office, there were 20,676 residential units completed in 2020, just 1.9 per cent lower than the 21,087 new units completed in 2019. </p>  <p>  Of course, further progress is required and that is why the addition of new and affordable homes continues to be supported through Government action. To this end, in Budget 2021, I amended the Stamp Duty Residential Development Refund Scheme to include operations commenced by 31 December 2022 and extended the time allowed between commencement and completion of a qualifying project by six months to two-and-a-half years.  This will encourage the development of residential properties on non-residential land. The provision of affordable homes was also supported through the Budget with an allocation of &euro;50 million to the Serviced Sites Fund to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of homes to purchase at discounted prices.</p>  <p>  The Government also continues to support first-time buyers. In Budget 2021, I extended the July Stimulus measures of the Help-to-Buy scheme to the end of 2021, which will provide further support to first-time buyers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment. First-time buyers who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan can also avail of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. This is a Government-backed mortgage on competitive terms for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build. </p>  <p>  In addition to the measures taken at budget-time, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, recently published the Land Development Agency Bill 2021. The Bill establishes the Land Development Agency (LDA) on a statutory basis and sets out the core goals of the LDA to undertake strategic land assembly and utilise state lands to build affordable homes. </p>  <p>  All of these measures testify to the need to take a multi-faceted approach to increase the supply of new housing and I will continue to work closely with my Government colleagues to ensure this is delivered.</p></reply>

The objective of these mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households and to reduce the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing.  The mortgage measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. For primary dwelling mortgages, the LTI limit is 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income.  For first-time buyers (FTBs), the LTV limit is 90% of the value of the residential property and for second and subsequent buyers the LTV is 80% of the value of the residential property.  However, lenders have a limited flexibility at their own discretion to provide to provide some mortgage lending in excess of these thresholds. </p>  <p>  While regulated lenders must comply with the various rules within the macroprudential and consumer protection frameworks, the extension of credit by lenders to potential customers is a commercial decision for the lender themselves, and each lender will have its own individual credit lending policies. Before providing a mortgage, a lender is required to undertake thorough creditworthiness assessments and satisfy itself about the ability of the borrower to repay the mortgage. This assessment must take into account the individual circumstances of the borrower, including personal circumstances and financial situation. In this context lenders can and do take into account rental payments when making their affordability assessment as part of regular underwriting process to assess borrowers&rsquo; ability to repay a mortgage.  </p>  <p>  However, the significant differences between the nature of a rental contract and a mortgage contract to purchase a home should also be borne in mind.  A house purchase and associated mortgage contract usually has a more long term character than a rental contract and so will leave the house purchaser/mortgage borrower more exposed to future shocks to incomes, house prices and interest rates in for a longer period of time.  Also the ability to make regular repayments &ndash; evidenced through rental payments &ndash; does not substitute or remove the need for the borrower to have a down payment deposit to purchase a house for a house.  Such a down payment provides the homeowner and borrower with an important prudent level of initial equity in the house and so can help households to absorb some fall in house prices before the borrower could fall into negative equity.     </p></reply>

Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection. Resources allocated to these different aspects of enforcement and compliance work are continuously adjusted in response to changes in the level of risk in different sectors. </p>  <p>  Revenue takes an integrated approach to combatting all forms of illegal trade and shadow economy activity, including combatting the illicit tobacco trade.  I am advised by Revenue that, in its experience, those involved in the illicit tobacco trade do not necessarily confine themselves to a particular commodity type. As a result, Revenue implements an integrated approach to all forms of illegal trade as distinct from a product or commodity specific focus.  </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 includes a focus and commitment to confronting non-compliance, which includes tobacco smuggling. This commitment is given operational priority each year in divisional business plans and operational plans that reflect the particular nuances of some illegal trades and the modus operandi of those involved. Revenue&rsquo;s actions under these operational plans are designed to maximise coordination Revenue-wide and deliver the best impact for the effort involved. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it implements a range of measures to identify and target the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the products and, where possible, prosecuting those involved. Revenue develops and shares intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, uses analytics and detection technologies and ensures the optimum deployment of resources on a risk-focused basis. </p>  <p>  The smuggling of tobacco products has a transnational and cross border dimension and, in addition to Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area, I am advised that Revenue also works closely with its counterparts in other jurisdictions including colleagues in Northern Ireland through the Cross Border Joint Agency Task Force (JATF), and international bodies including OLAF (the EU&rsquo;s anti-fraud agency), Europol and the World Customs Organisation.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised that Revenue&rsquo;s activities aimed at combatting tobacco smuggling continued throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  This work yielded excellent results and in 2020 Revenue seized 48.1 million illicit cigarettes and approximately 7,100kgs of illicit tobacco. </p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee. </p><p>Under section 118B TCA 1997 an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment.</p><p>Where a bicycle or safety equipment is purchased under the Cycle to Work scheme or through a salary sacrifice arrangement certain conditions must be met, for example:</p><p>- The exemption applies to the first &euro;1,250 of expenditure incurred by the employer in obtaining a bicycle and related safety equipment. This exemption limit is increased to &euro;1,500 for pedelecs or ebikes and related safety equipment. Employers may incur costs in excess of these limits, but any such excess will not qualify for the exemption and will be liable to tax. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same monetary limits.</p><p>- The bicycle and related safety equipment must be new and must be purchased by the employer. </p><p>- The bicycle and related safety equipment must be used by the employee or director mainly for the whole or part of their journey to or from work.</p><p>- An employee or director can only avail of the Cycle to Work scheme once in any 4 year period. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same time limits and any salary sacrifice arrangement entered into must be completed within a 12 month period.</p><p>The Cycle to Work scheme is only applicable where the bicycle and safety equipment is provided by an employer to either a director or someone in its employment. Thus, where an employer-employee relationship does not exist, for example, in the case of self-employed individuals, students, retired individuals, job seekers or those in unpaid work, such individuals can&rsquo;t qualify for the scheme. Likewise, salary sacrifice arrangements may only be entered into between an employer and a director or employee.</p><p>Further guidance regarding the Cycle to Work scheme and salary sacrifice arrangements can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).</p><p>Having said that, I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence or withdrawal of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses. Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. To achieve this aim there is a focus on:</p><p>- Investing almost &euro;1 billion in flood relief measures over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027; </p><p>- Implementation of flood relief management plans by the Office of Public Works (OPW), and;  </p><p>- Maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in affected areas.</p><p>The above approach is underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and industry representatives Insurance Ireland, who meet on a quarterly basis to help implement this initiative. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should in turn provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in these areas. </p><p>I acknowledge that while there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2020, some householders are still experiencing difficulties. This is particularly the case for households in areas with demountable flood defences. Indeed, this is one of the key themes that arose from my Department&rsquo;s Public Consultation on Climate Change and Insurance. My officials engage with both Insurance Ireland, the OPW and other stakeholders regarding flood defence schemes and how the levels of insurance cover might be improved in areas where flood defence works have been completed.<b></b>This is a difficult issue, however the Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will also continue to engage on all aspects of insurance reform, including flood insurance issues, and that every effort is being made to encourage a responsive approach from the insurance industry. As  recent as last month Minister of State Fleming participated in a meeting between Insurance Ireland and OPW Minister of State Donovan on the issue. </p><p>Furthermore, as the Deputy may be aware, the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code states that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customer it acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market. In the event that an insurance undertaking refuses to quote a consumer for property insurance, the Consumer Protection Code states that an insurer must inform the consumer of its refusal and its reasons for refusing cover.</p><p>Finally, individuals who feel they have been unfairly treated by an Insurance or Financial Services Provider can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman. I would also note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover, including flood insurance. This can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

The centrepiece of the NGEU is the Recovery and Resilience Facility, made up of &euro;312.5 billion in grants and &euro;360 billion in loans.</p>  <p>  In order to avail of funding under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, all Member States must submit a National Recovery and Resilience Plan. Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan must be submitted to the European Commission by 30 April 2021 and will set out a package of both reforms and public investment projects which will be implemented by 2026. The Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, working with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment, are responsible for the preparation and coordination of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. Reforms and Investments attracting funding under the NRRP will be paid on a performance basis through the Recovery and Resilience Facility, in other words, when agreed milestones and targets are achieved, drawdown of funding can happen.</p>  <p>  In May 2020, the European Commission produced a needs assessment underpinning the proposed NGEU. In this needs assessment the European Commission estimated that Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the NGEU package would be in the region of approximately &euro;18.7 billion over the next thirty years. However, this estimate was inaccurate for a number of reasons and was intended only as an illustrative example of what might be and was not based on real budget figures.</p>  <p>  At this time of crisis, the Covid recovery funds are needed now, and will be received by Member States up to 2026, but will be paid back over 30+ years. These repayments are not expected to begin for a number of years yet, and the contribution Ireland will make has yet to be determined and will depend on our share of the overall EU budget over the course of those repayments.  They will also depend on what new Own Resources are agreed at EU level. It is not possible to give an accurate overall figure at this time. </p></reply>

This includes agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation in June 2020, which together with the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, will be the cornerstone of the EU&rsquo;s sustainable finance regulatory architecture.</p><p>In particular, the application of the Taxonomy Regulation, which establishes a harmonised classification system for environmentally sustainable activities, will have a significant role in supporting the mobilisation of capital towards sustainable investments. Through providing common definitions to companies, investors and policymakers on what constitutes an environmentally sustainable economic activity, it can create security for investors and protect private investors from greenwashing. Additionally, it can assist companies in planning for the low-carbon transition. </p><p>The EU taxonomy will be an important driver in supporting implementation of the Green Deal, which will simultaneously support the development of the sustainable finance sector. As the Deputy will be aware, the Irish Government has long recognised the importance of sustainable finance as well as its associated opportunities. Reflecting this, sustainable finance is a horizontal priority within the Government&rsquo;s strategy for the further development of the international financial services sector, &lsquo;Ireland for Finance&rsquo;.  The strategy strives to make Ireland a true leader in the field of sustainable finance, in particular through further enhancing and deepening the base of expertise and activity in sustainable finance. It is important that the financial sector is prepared for the new regulatory regime, and in this vein, the Ireland for Finance Action Plan 2020 contained an action focussed on the development and delivery of educational programmes on sustainable finance, including on the EU taxonomy. Through Action 32: <i>Deliver training programmes in sustainable finance and responsible investment supported by the Sustainable Finance Skillnet</i>, Action Plan 2021 continues this focus on skills development.</p><p>Green bonds also play an increasingly important role in financing assets needed for the low-carbon transition. However, currently there is no uniform green bond standard within the EU. Establishing such a standard was a recommendation in the final report of the Commission High-Level Expert Group on sustainable finance. It was then included as an action in the 2018 Commission Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth. A legislative proposal is expected to be delivered later in 2021.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan.  The details of the scheme are set out in Finance Act 2020 and guidelines on the operation of the scheme, including the eligibility criteria, are available on the Revenue website</p><p>The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.</p><p>The &euro;5,000 cap is designed to ensure that, while any size business may access the scheme, the main beneficiaries of CRSS are SMEs and high turnover/low fixed costs businesses do not disproportionately benefit.  </p><p>The CRSS has provided substantial support for over 21,600 eligible businesses. Up to 29 March, CRSS payments of &euro;410m have been made to businesses since the inception of the Scheme, approximately &euro;260m of which has been paid in the first quarter of 2021. The hospitality and tourism sector (bars, cafes, restaurants, hotels and other accommodation providers) has received approximately &euro;240m in CRSS payments since last October and &euro;105 million of these payments have been made by Revenue in the first quarter of 2021. </p><p>The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions, and supplements other Covid-related supports such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). </p><p>There are no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS or the &euro;5,000 cap. The purpose of the CRSS is to provide additional support to the businesses who have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health Regulations.  </p><p>The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.  </p><p>I have confirmed that  the CRSS and EWSS will be extended until June 2021,  and as I have outlined previously,  consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible.

Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, or indeed where an employee incurs costs in excess of the &euro;3.20 per day paid by the employer, I am advised that the employees concerned retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses they have incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment.  PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional electricity, heat and broadband in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use. </p>  <p>  If an expense is shared between two or more people, the allowable cost being 10% of electricity and heat and 30% of broadband, can be apportioned based on the amount paid by each individual. To claim an allowable e-working expense, the employee must have incurred the cost and it is the responsibility of the employee to retain proof of payment. </p>  <p>  PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end. Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has published detailed guidance on this subject and on the question of how claims for e-working expenses should be calculated and submitted in the Tax and Duty manual TDM 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax, which is available on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

However, public procurement will play an important role in addressing the same objectives as the EU Taxonomy i.e. climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. In 2019, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a Circular to public bodies to promote the use of environmental and social considerations in public procurement. As set out in the Programme for Government, we will develop and implement a sustainable procurement policy during the lifetime of this government, to minimise the environmental impact of products and services procured and will mandate the inclusion of green criteria in all procurements using public funds. Furthermore, the Office of Government Procurement will update its procurement frameworks in line with green procurement practice. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan sets out the investment priorities that will underpin the successful implementation of the National Planning Framework. The current review of the National Development Plan is considering the following fundamental elements:</p>  <p>  Level:  There will be an assessment of the economic and social case for the overall level of capital expenditure commitment into the future. </p>  <p>  Share:  This element will consider the share of capital expenditure across Departments or sectors and the need to adjust Sectoral allocations in order to successfully deliver on Government priorities. </p>  <p>  Priorities: This will ensure alignment with the policy priorities in the Programme for Government, notably housing, health, climate action, transport and job creation and enterprise development. </p>  <p>  Spatial Alignment: This will investigate whether the NDP aligns sufficiently with the spatial strategy set out in the National Planning Framework of compact growth as well as city and regional growth targets. </p>  <p>  Governance:  The final key area will assess whether the structures and rules for the management, governance and oversight of projects are in place to deliver on the ambitions of the revised NDP. </p>  <p>  Climate was an important consideration in the development of the current National Development Plan and is also in the ongoing appraisal of projects and programmes.  However, in recognition of the need for systemic change, there will be an overarching focus on climate action throughout the new National Development Plan. It is intended that Departments will be required to assess their spending proposals/allocations against a range of environmental outcomes to ensure that their investment priorities are aligned with Ireland&rsquo;s climate and environmental objectives. To complement this sectoral assessment of the National Development Plan, my Department is proposing that the whole of the National Development Plan is assessed against a suitable climate/environmental methodology which is line with international good practices.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the National Development Plan is not a vehicle through which investment proposals are approved. All project and programme proposals included in the Plan are subject to the detailed rigour of the Public Spending Code. The Public Spending Code is not static. It is updated regularly to reflect lessons learned and international good practice. My Department has an ongoing body of work to strengthen the Public Spending Code requirements and guidance to support public bodies in their evaluation, planning and management of capital projects. This includes strengthening the consideration of environmental and climate factors in project appraisal, planning and delivery. In particular, I anticipate altering the shadow cost of carbon that applies to all projects once the higher targets envisaged in the draft Climate Action Bill are adopted. This will ensure that the amount of emissions a project may give rise to is quantified and a value placed on those emissions that reflects the cost the society will have to bear to eliminate these emissions in the future. This in turn allows the appraisal to determine if this future burden outweighs any benefits the project may bring. </p></reply>

The SEUPB operates under the policy direction of the North South Ministerial Council, and is headquartered in Belfast, with smaller offices in Omagh and Monaghan.</p><p>I am advised of the following with regard to all of the bodies encompassed by the question:</p><p><b>Office of Public Works (OPW)</b></p><p>The OPW's Quality Customer Service (QCS) Network oversee the preparation of each new Language Scheme and monitor implementation of the scheme to ensure that the OPW is compliant with its obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003. The QCS Network comprises of members from each of the business areas within the OPW. Each business area is required to reflect the commitments of the Language Scheme in its business plan and monitor implementation, as appropriate. An updated Irish Language Scheme is due to be rolled out in the OPW shortly. </p><p>While the OPW does not have a designated Irish language officer, staff are reminded periodically of their responsibilities in respect of the Official Languages Act 2003 and the OPW Language Scheme.  Detailed guidance and instructions have been made available to those who may need to implement Irish language measures. </p><p>An audit by An Coimisineir Teanga was carried out in 2019 on the use of the official languages on signage at heritage sites of the Office of Public Works and its language scheme commitments in relation to the Gaeltacht</p><p><b>National Shared Services Office (NSSO)</b></p><p>The National Shared Services Office understands its obligations in relation to the use of Irish, has a designated Irish language officer and is compliant under the Official Languages Act 2003. The NSSO is fully committed to providing a bilingual service. The NSSO is dedicated to ensuring customer service is available in both languages. The NSSO has agents available in all Shared Services Centres to take calls and respond to emails and letters in Irish. The customer service phone lines are also bilingual and stationary displays the names and addresses in both Irish and English, and all customer alerts are bilingual.  Both the Payroll and HR portals (for customers and internal use) are fully bilingual, with all information and forms available in both languages. The NSSO was established as a statutory office in 2018 and has not yet had services audited for compliance with the Official Languages Act.</p><p><b>Public Appointments Service (PAS)</b></p><p>The PAS Irish Language Scheme 2017&ndash;2020 sets out the commitments which PAS has made in terms of the services which they will provide to candidates applying for competitions being run by PAS (and in compliance with the Official Languages Act).  The scheme was confirmed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and remains in effect until a new Scheme has been confirmed by the Minister.  PAS have a full-time translator on staff and also an Irish Language Officer.</p><p>PAS have a number of staff that are competent in Irish and offer staff opportunities to take Irish courses to learn/improve (increasing general staff competency in Irish is part of the Scheme). </p><p>Responsibility has been assigned to specific staff for all elements of the Scheme and elements of this (those which are the most subject to change) are audited on a regular basis by a dedicated staff member.</p><p><b>Office of the Ombudsman</b></p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman, the Commission for Public Service Appointments, the Office of the Information Commissioner and the Office of the Commissioner for Environmental Information operate a joint scheme, and have a designated Irish language officer in place.  The Offices are in full compliance with the provisions of the Act and also have an Irish Language scheme in place. The Irish language Officer carries out a review of the adherence of the Offices to the Act and the Irish Language Scheme. A review was recently completed and covered the year 2020.</p><p>The Standards in Public Office Commission is in compliance with the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003 and has an Irish language scheme in place. This Scheme has been confirmed by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. It commenced with effect from 1 October 2018. The Commission reports on its activities under the Official Languages Act in its annual reports. </p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman provides staff to the Commission. While there is no formal &ldquo;Designated Irish Officer&rdquo; role set out in the current scheme, the Commission has two members of staff designated to provide services in Irish. The Commission&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of services is outlined in its lrish language scheme and includes provision of reception/telephone services in Irish on request; correspondence and email in the requested official language; publication of annual reports and most documents in both official languages (further detail as specified in the scheme); publication of the Commission&rsquo;s websites (sipo.ie and lobbying.ie) in both official languages; and publication of press releases in both official languages</p><p>There is no explicit provision in the scheme for an audit, however, it is not a requirement of the Act. The Act provides that a review may be conducted at the request of the Minister; no such request has been received to date. The current scheme is in place for a three-year period (2018&ndash;2021) and must be reviewed at that time. It is intended that a new scheme will be developed this year and a review of the current scheme would accompany that.</p><p><b>State Laboratory</b></p><p>The State Laboratory is a scheduled office under the aegis of my Department which provides a comprehensive analytical and advisory service to Government departments and offices. It does not provide a service to the public. The State Laboratory is compliant with obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003.  However, it does not have a designated Irish language officer and has not had services audited for compliance with the Act.</p><p><b>Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery</b></p><p>The Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery is compliant with its obligations under the Official Languages Act, 2003, but does not provide any services to the public and therefore this does not apply to the Office.</p><p><b>Institute of Public Administration</b></p><p>The IPA does not have a dedicated Irish language officer.  It has a staff member who is an Irish speaker. The IPA is in the process of developing its third official language scheme. The IPA has not had its services audited for compliance with the Act</p><p><b>Economic &amp;amp; Social Research Institute</b></p><p>Whilst the ESRI does not have a designated Irish Language Officer, a member of staff who is a fluent Irish speaker fulfils this role when the need arises normally in relation to media interviews. The ESRI is currently reviewing its processes to ensure it is fully compliant with the Official Languages Act.</p><p><b>Special EU Programmes Body </b></p><p>The SEUPB adheres to the following mandatory requirements under the Official Languages Act 2003:</p><p>-  All written communication are responded to in the Irish language when it is received in Irish;</p><p>-  Headings of the SEUPB&rsquo;s letterhead stationery include the organisation&rsquo;s address in Irish;</p><p>-  The SEUPB&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in the Irish language, before being published; and</p><p>-  In terms of signage the SEUPB&rsquo;s logo contains an Irish translation of the organisation&rsquo;s name. </p><p>The SEUPB retains the services of a language translation company with immediate access to accredited Irish language translators. </p></reply>

All Local Authorities, including Cavan County Council and Monaghan County Council, may carry out flood mitigation works, using either their own resources, or by applying for funding under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme which was introduced by my Office on an administrative, non-statutory basis in 2009.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised fluvial flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. The works to be funded are carried out under local authority powers and ongoing maintenance of the completed works is the responsibility of the Council. </p>  <p>  Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management. Full details of this scheme are available on www.gov.ie/opw</p>  <p>  In 2020, the OPW approved funding of &euro;75,600 to Cavan County Council for projects at Aghadreenagh Redhills, Ballyhaise Pitch, Ballyhaise Cavan Rd, Drumliffe Ballyhaise Knockateery Cloverhill and Mullinavaranogue.  The OPW has recently approved funding of &euro;75,500 to Monaghan County Council for a project at Drumfalra, Ballybay.</p>  <p>  The OPW&rsquo;s annual Arterial Drainage Maintenance Works Programme includes the following river catchments in the Cavan and Monaghan areas: Boyne, Inny, Blackwater and Glyde and Dee.</p>  <p>  The OPW does not have Arterial Drainage Schemes on the River Erne system in County Cavan and is not responsible for channel maintenance in the area in accordance with its statutory requirements under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. However, parts of the Erne Catchment are a Drainage District for which the local authority is responsible for ongoing maintenance.</p>  <p>Cavan County Council confirmed in May 2019 that the Council would act as lead agency on the management and delivery of the proposed flood relief scheme in Cavan Town and a steering group, comprising of representatives from the Office of Public Works and Cavan County Council, is now in place to progress the Scheme. On 5th   March 2021 Cavan County Council, in partnership with the OPW, issued the tender documentation for the procurement of Engineering Consultants to the OPW Framework of Consultants. Tenders are due for return on 6 May 2021.  </p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress the Flood Relief Scheme for Cavan, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of this scheme. </p>  <p>  While the three proposed schemes in County Monaghan, for Ballybay, Iniskeen and Monaghan town, are not in the first tranche of flood relief projects to be progressed, the OPW and Monaghan County Council will work closely to ensure that they will be commenced as soon as possible within the 10 Year timeframe for the programme of investment.</p></reply>

This is a proposal which demonstrates the importance placed by the Commission, EU Member States, the UK and Ireland on the strengthening of peace and prosperity across Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland.</p><p>PEACE PLUS will continue and build upon the work of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes by combining these two funding strands into a single programme which covers an eligible area of Northern Ireland and Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo. Provision for the new programme is included in the January 2020 Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK, and in the accompanying Political Declaration, as well as in the December 2020 EU-UK Joint Declaration on Participation in Union Programmes and Access to Programme Services.</p><p>Programme development for PEACE PLUS is now well advanced. This process is being led by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), a North South Implementation body under the joint sponsorship of my Department and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland. SEUPB is being assisted by a cross-sectoral Programme Development Steering Group, consisting of representatives of both governments as well as of local government, trade union, business, environment, community and voluntary sector, rural and equality sectors.</p><p>On foot of extensive public consultation and engagement with government departments North and South, SEUPB has prepared a draft programme which covers six thematic areas of cross-border activity:</p><p>-  Building Peaceful and Thriving Communities;</p><p>-  Delivering Economic Regeneration and Transformation;</p><p>-  Empowering and Investing in Our Young People;</p><p>-  Healthy and Inclusive Communities;</p><p>-  Supporting a Sustainable Future;</p><p>-  Building and Embedding Partnership and Collaboration.</p><p>The draft PEACE PLUS programme is now open to further public consultation for a two month period, which will conclude on 12 May 2021. I would encourage all stakeholders to make their views known during this consultation period. Following the public consultation and any necessary revisions arising from it, it is intended to bring the draft programme for approval by both the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, followed by submission to the European Commission for final approval. </p><p>Ireland has consistently advocated for as large and impactful a programme as possible in financial terms, especially in view of the twin challenges posed by Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. The final funding quantum for PEACE PLUS will be  determined in the context of EU UK negotiations and a Financing Agreement between the EU, UK and Ireland. Funding will be provided by the European Union, the UK Government, the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. However, the draft programme has been developed on the basis of a budget in the region of &euro;1 billion.</p></reply>

A very detailed assessment of six sites in Dublin, including Military Road, was undertaken by the evaluation panel.  In November 2015, the evaluation panel concluded that, based on the evaluation assessment and the brief of requirements from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the site at Military Road was deemed the most suitable.</p>  <p>  The numbers of staff being accommodated in the new Garda Security and Crime Operations Centre, Military Road meet the specifications and brief as requested of the OPW at the time the site was selected.  However, a range of strategic modernisation initiatives undertaken by the Garda Commissioner in recent years has led to an increase in numbers in the specialist Bureaus and Units attached to Harcourt Square and staffing numbers have increased as a result of the expansion of the Garda workforce.  </p>  <p>  As part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s overall strategic planning, in addition to the new facility being built at Military Rd, is a relocation of it&rsquo;s Command and Control Centre (presently in Harcourt Square) to a new facility at Heuston Station, being developed by the National Transport Authority and Irish Rail.  This will support a more integrated &lsquo;blue light&rsquo; response for the public, and includes Dublin City Council&rsquo;s blue light requirements.  </p>  <p>  The overall strategy to meet the requirements of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is constantly under review and include a major upgrade, restoration and refurbishment of its Headquarters in the Phoenix Park and the associated relocation of key Units to this site in order to optimise the accommodation of specialist Garda operations. </p>  <p>  For example, Forensic Science Ireland will be vacating Garda HQ from mid-2022 and moving to their new laboratory building in Backweston and another building in Garda HQ is being restored.  An existing OPW lease in a nearby building will be available for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This will release additional space for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s use.</p>  <p>  Both the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are aware of the impact of a changing workforce on the property solutions currently being advanced.  The OPW continues to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its task in mapping out what it envisages is likely to be its property requirements in the coming years, in line with its workforce plans, insofar as it can anticipate those requirements.  </p>  <p>  The new Garda Security and Crime Operations Centre building at Military Rd  will be fully completed by September 2022. The project is on time and on budget.</p></reply>

The Government's response to the impact of the pandemic on the sector and the economy generally is comprised of a broad range of supports delivered across a range of Departments.  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme  and the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme form the principle elements of the Government's response.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently announced the Small Business Assistance Scheme for Covid (SBASC) as a further horizontal support across all sectors of the economy.  SMEs and Businesses in the non-funded live events sector are eligible to apply under this scheme.</p><p>I was pleased to recently announce a new &euro;50 million suite of additional measures to further support those in the Live Entertainment Sector. As part of this suite, an allocation of &euro;25 million is being made available under the Live Performance Support Scheme 2021.  This scheme builds on the successful outcomes of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences.  </p><p>The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. </p><p>As a further support measure for those in the live entertainment industry, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for a new scheme to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) will see support to assist with business overheads offered by way of two levels of flat payments:</p><p>-  &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p><p>-  &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000. </p><p>Under the scheme, musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers - whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply. This scheme has been developed following wide consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department. The eligibility threshold of &euro;20,000 aims to strike an appropriate balance having regard to other available supports and the need to reach as many professional musicians and crew as possible. The scheme will open when the necessary administrative and IT systems are in place.</p><p>An allocation of up to &euro;5 million will also be made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres and other locations, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events.  Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances.  </p><p>Further information on the business and financial supports my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has in place to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis can be viewed at the following link . </p></reply>

In particular, in September 2020 I increased from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million, the threshold within which local authorities can advance their proposals for new social housing construction projects, for funding confirmation by my Department via a single approval process.  </p><p>As Minister, I have established a High Level Housing Delivery Group which meets regularly and includes key stakeholders from the local authorities, the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Housing Agency and the Housing Delivery Coordination Office (HDCO). This Group meets regularly to monitor and coordinate delivery of social housing programmes and to identify and address any systemic issues that could block or delay progress. </p><p>I have also enhanced the role of the HDCO to work with all local authorities on accelerating their social housing construction programmes, including the activation of existing sites and the acquisition and development of new sites.  The restrictions on construction activity from 8th January last - following on from the 2020 restrictions - will have an unavoidable impact on the completion timelines for all housing construction, including public housing.  However this week&rsquo;s announcement of the phased easing of public health restrictions will now see all residential construction projects able to recommence from 12th April.  I will be asking all local authorities to work with the construction sector to prioritise the earliest possible resumption of public housing projects, consistent with the public health guidelines.  </p><p>The Government will be publishing a new housing strategy this year, which will set out details of social housing delivery out to 2025, including social housing targets for 2022 onwards. While local authorities already have social housing construction programmes in train, I am keen that they are proactive in adding to this pipeline and, working with the AHBs, in advancing their existing projects as speedily as possible with the assurance of the funding being available from my Department. </p><p>To provide transparency on the new social housing projects being advanced, my Department publishes a Social Housing Construction Status Report each quarter. These reports provide details of the social housing construction schemes completed and those in the pipeline for all local authority areas. The report for 2020 is available at the following link: . The publication of this information can also give Councillors and public representatives the opportunity to work with the local authority officials to press the advancement of these social housing delivery projects, in line with the 2021 delivery targets already in place and the multi-annual targets that we will be publishing with this year's new housing strategy.</p></reply>

Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP.</p><p>Under HAP, households at risk of homelessness may be eligible for additional supports.  To qualify for specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988.  The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder Service, is a matter for each local authority.</p><p>In order for housing assistance to be provided under the Act the housing authority must be satisfied that the tenancy concerned is or would be a tenancy in good faith.Where there is a family relationship between the tenant and the landlord, the housing authority may seek evidence of a previous landlord and tenant relationship between a landlord and the HAP applicant.  This evidence may include:</p><p>-  Proof of rent payments;</p><p>-  A lease or tenancy agreement for the property; and</p><p>-  Registration of the tenancy with the Residential Tenancies Board.</p><p>HAP support is available to tenants in rent a room scheme arrangements, however, the rental of a room to a civil partner, son or daughter is excluded from this scheme.  HAP cannot be paid where the tenant is seeking to rent within the family home. </p><p>In order for a housing authority to be satisfied that a tenancy is or would be in good faith, the onus is on the applicant and landlord to prove that what is being proposed is a bona fide tenancy.  Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the housing authority to make a decision in each individual case. </p></reply>

For example: </p>  <p>- The Energy Efficiency Programme aims to improve energy performance and comfort levels in homes. Since 2014, 60,357 homes have benefited from some level of retrofitting works at a cost of &euro;134m</p>  <p>- The Voids Programme funds local authorities to remediate vacant homes to ensure they meet minimum letting standards. Since 2014, 16,102 vacant local authority homes have been remediated and re-let at a cost of &euro;229m</p>  <p>- The Disabled Persons Grant Scheme funds necessary adaptations to local authority housing stock to accommodate the needs of the elderly and disabled and to relieve overcrowding. Since 2014, thousands of households have had their living conditions improved at a cost of &euro;94m.   </p>  <p>  Moving forward, my Department is working with the local authority sector, through the City and County Management Association to transition the sector to a new planned maintenance approach based on stock condition surveys.  Budget 2021 saw a significant uplift in Energy Efficiency funding and the Programme for Government commits to further funding being made available to local authorities going forward for planned maintenance works; insulation, windows and doors and heating systems. </p>  <p>  With regards to Traveller Accommodation, a Programme Board has now been established to drive the implementation of recommendations contained within the Traveller Accommodation Expert Review Report. The Board had its first meeting on the 24 March 2021. Progress has already been made on a number of the recommendations set out in the report including the method of allocation of funding to local authorities which was modified in 2020 and improvements to data capture on the characteristics of the Traveller community as part of the Census.</p>  <p>  A revised and affordable Caravan Loan Scheme for Traveller families is being introduced on a 6-month pilot basis across four local authorities from May 2021 with the objective of rolling it out nationally if the pilot proves successful. This scheme has the potential to make an immediate and hugely significant improvement to living conditions for many Traveller families. For the first time in six years the full capital and current budget allocations for Traveller accommodation were expended in 2020. </p>  <p>  In 2020 just over 250 halting sites, both authorised and unauthorised, were audited for Covid preparedness and a list of deficiencies and checklist of works was prepared for each site. This resulted in over &euro;4m of investment in improvements to site conditions.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensuring the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his / her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on the Department's website at the following link:  </p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.  </p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered. </p></reply>

This represents a decrease of 6,813 households or 9.9% on the last assessment in June 2019. Since 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 61,880, a reduction of 32.4%.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system in the Programme for Government, &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo;, Government approved the priority drafting of the Affordable Housing Bill 2020 on 22 December 2020, and I published the General Scheme on 20 January last.</p>  <p>  The Bill includes provisions to underpin three schemes delivering on the Programme for Government commitment to prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes for purchase delivered by local authorities (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental. The provision of affordable housing to purchase is covered by two of the three elements of the Bill. The drafting of the Bill is progressing well.</p>  <p>  The Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) supports affordable homes being delivered by local authorities, funding infrastructure on local authority lands to enable the delivery of affordable homes to purchase or rent. Funding of almost &euro;188 million has been approved in principle in support of 38 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 4,000 more affordable homes. In addition to these projects, approval in principle has also been given to three further applications for SSF funding, namely, Dublin City Council&rsquo;s projects in Emmet Road and Oscar Traynor Road, and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council&rsquo;s project in Shanganagh. Affordable homes for purchase provided by local authorities via the SSF will come with an initial purchase price of between 10% and 40% below market prices.</p>  <p>  Another element of the Bill, the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme, is designed to help bridge the gap, by means of an equity stake, between the mortgage people have and the price of the new home they wish to buy. This affordability measure will increase housing supply and will enable First Time Buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford.</p>  <p>  In addition to the measures in the Affordable Housing Bill 2020, the Land Development Agency is tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. The LDA will have regard to Government policy, and all appropriate legislation, on the appropriate tenure mix for developments on public land, as well as the criteria for the operation of cost rental and affordable housing schemes.</p>  <p>  Additional affordability measures which promote housing supply, such as the Help to buy scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are already available to eligible applicants.</p>  <p>  The Help to Buy Scheme has had 23,545 approvals by the end of February 2021, with the estimated total value of approved Help to Buy claims to date in the order of &euro;389.2 million.</p>  <p>  At the end of February 2021, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan had 3,817 approvals. Budget 2021 confirmed that &euro;210 million has been sanctioned for RIHL lending in 2021.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist local authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding. It is a matter for each local authority to set targets for the provision of Traveller accommodation, which they outline in their Traveller accommodation programmes. </p>  <p>In 2020,  funding of &euro;14.5 million was provided for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation for new building and improvement works.  For  2021 this funding has increased to &euro;15.5 million. In addition, in 2020, my Department provided &euro;56.4 million on the repair and re-let of 3,067  vacant local authority homes. </p>  <p>  Addressing homelessness is a significant priority for this Government with &euro;218m in Exchequer funding allocated to support the provision of homeless accommodation services in 2021.  My Department&rsquo;s role involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at a local level.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities and Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation services.</p>  <p>  While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis, with nine administrative regions in place.  In the Mid West region, Limerick City and County Council is the lead authority for the region along with Clare.    A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  It is a matter for the management group of the consultative forum, in the first instance, to determine the need for services and the funding required to address homelessness at a regional level.  My Department contributed some &euro;9.2m in Exchequer funding to the Mid West region in support of homeless accommodation services in 2020.</p></reply>

Full details of the approvals are available online at www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF.</p><p>All proposals for funding under LIHAF were evaluated and assessed in line with the criteria set out in Appendix 1 to the original Call for Proposals.  These criteria included the link to housing delivery; the level of innovation and collaboration, the strategic fit of the proposal, the financial package and the delivery outcomes. The detailed criteria are available at the same link www.rebuildingireland.ie/lihaf/.</p><p>Of the 30 projects, 2 projects will not proceed. Kildare County Council has confirmed that the Naas Inner Relief Road will not progress andD&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has confirmed that the Clay Farm project will now not proceed. One further project, Clonburris in South Dublin County Council, will not avail of LIHAF funding but will proceed in conjunction with funding from the Urban Renewal Development Fund.</p><p>In terms of LIHAF funding drawdown, thus far, most infrastructure projects have been at the design, planning and procurement stages, and the bulk of expenditure will arise during the construction phase.  This is reflected in the level of expenditure to end Q1 2021, with approximately &euro;61.248m in Exchequer funds drawn down (matched by a further 25% local authority funding bringing the total expenditure to &euro;81.664m).

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.  Fire services issues are managed in my Department by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM). </p><p>Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide, with 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staff by retained firefighters.</p><p>My Department collects statistics from local authorities, on an annual basis, regarding fire service attendance at incidents and the types of incident involved. Fire statistics for the past five years are available at the link below:</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in regard to mobilisation of fire service responses is not available in my Department. However, it should be noted that the arrangements for mobilising a response to a 999/112 call from the public for fire service assistance are handled at three Regional Communications Centres, where call-takers establish the location and nature of the emergency and then mobilise the nearest available fire brigade resource (or resources) to the scene. Individual fire stations (or an appliance in the station in the case of multi-appliance stations) may not be available to respond (they may already be attending another call) or may be 'off the run' at different times for a number of reasons, including the non-availability of personnel. Where a crew are already dealing with an incident or are unavailable for any reason, the next resources on the pre-determined attendance list for that kind of emergency are mobilised by the Regional Communications Centre. I am aware that a small number of situations occurred over the last twelve months where crews were not available due to covid cases or close contacts with covid cases. However, an appropriate fire service response was made to all calls for assistance from the public.  </p><p>While my Department does not routinely collect the data in the format requested by the Deputy, a breakdown of the number of firefighters in each fire service as of March 2021, based on data supplied by local authorities, is set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Fire service </b></th>       <th><b>Total no. of operational staff in stations </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>93 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>76 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City </td>       <td>152 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County </td>       <td>204 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>154 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td>963 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>138 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>104 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>63 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>67 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>73 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>43 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>140 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>100 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>119 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>72 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>51 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>51 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>47 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>127 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>124 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>46 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>64 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>95 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>3301</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.  Fire services issues are managed in my Department by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM). </p><p>The Farrell Grant Sparks (FGS) Report referred to by the Deputy was published in January 2002 and it represented a comprehensive review of fire services and fire safety in Ireland at that time. </p><p>It identified a number of areas where fire services and the overall approach to fire safety could be improved and was an important landmark in the development of fire services in Ireland.  Implementation of its recommendations contributed towards a re-orientation and re-shaping of local authority fire services, with a systemic approach to fire risk management, including a much greater emphasis on Community Fire Safety, together with the focus on incident response.</p><p>As the recommendations of the FGS Report were implemented through the Fire Services Change Programme (2005 - 2007) there has been significant development of fire services in Ireland across a wide spectrum of areas. The National Incident Command System was established and Standard Operating Guidance to support safe and effective operations were developed and introduced across all fire services.</p><p>The most significant outcome, which is attributed generally to the Community Fire Safety approach,  is the decline in the rate of fire-related fatalities  which, averaged over three years, now stands at four deaths per million of population, placing Ireland in the league of most fire safe countries. We cannot be complacent, however, and there are significant ongoing fire safety programmes as well as investment in and development of infrastructure including fire stations, the appliance fleet, equipment and training. </p><p>After the successful Fire Services Change Programme, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) was established in my Department in 2009 to give effect to the recommendations in the FGS Report relating to the role of national government in supporting local authority fire services.  </p><p>This NDFEM structure has proved to be very effective, and the close collaboration between my Department and local authority fire services has been central to the development of effective emergency management response to a range of severe weather and flooding emergencies since 2009. Likewise national fire safety campaigns have been carried out successfully in the aftermath of tragic fires. </p><p>The NDFEM carried out a further significant review of fire services and fire safety in Ireland in 2012 and published the policy document &quot;Keeping Communities Safe<i>&quot;</i>in 2013. This sets out an approach a to fire safety cross a number of areas, including risk management; fire safety; service response; dealing with large scale incidents; inter-agency work; major emergency management; quality assurance; performance reporting and implementation.  The Review is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>In 2016, an external validation exercise on the implementation by local authorities of &quot;Keeping Communities Safe&quot;, concluded that the public are served well by fire services in Ireland.  There has been a welcome downward trend in fires and other emergencies requiring fire service assistance over a number of years and a reduction in the incidence of loss of life in fire as noted above. </p><p>In conclusion, the FGS Report was a point of major change in the approach to fire safety and fire services in Ireland and the developments arising from the implementation of its recommendations have made Ireland a safer country. </p></reply>

The LGMA works with the NDFEM to monitor issues associated with recruitment and retention and on developing strategies to address issues which arise. It is clear that in some areas societal changes are impacting on the availability of personnel for the retained fire service and the number of candidates applying for retained fire service positions is limited in some cases.  However, local authorities across the country continue to maintain their fire services throughout. </p>  <p>  In relation to upskilling, on initially joining the fire service, retained firefighters are trained in accordance with a national syllabus. Fire-fighters are given further specialist training as required in the early stages of their careers. They continue to practice their skills through-out their careers with weekly on-station training. However, this ongoing local training has been disrupted by covid-related restrictions, as has much of fire service training provided at national level. </p>  <p>  Promotional opportunities in the retained fire services are limited of necessity to vacancies which arise in the fire fighters' own station. The LGMA is currently engaged with with staff representative bodies in relation to changing one aspect of promotion arrangements, as part of the overall terms of employment.  </p>  <p>  In summary, the issues of recruitment, retention, upskilling and promotion of retained firefighter are continuously monitored by the LGMA in association with the Management Board of the NDFEM. The aim is to ensure that the entire country continues to be served effectively into the coming decades by fire services that are equipped to face and meet the challenges of our ever-changing society. </p></reply>

Many of these sites have parking facilities which are upgraded and maintained on an ongoing basis as part of the regular operation activities of the NPWS, subject to both resourcing and consideration of the conservation requirements of these sites. </p><p>The pandemic has exposed significant challenges on all National Parks, nature reserves and scenic areas and I am of the view that alternative measures to reduce pressures on habitats and natural amenities must be prioritised over and above extending or providing car parks.</p><p>I am keen that sustainable mobility options  be explored in the longer term to reduce traffic pressures.

The website provides useful information for property owners on how to bring their vacant properties back into use and on available financial supports. </p><p>The latest statistics from vacanthomes.ie indicate that <b>106</b>properties in County Westmeath and <b>39</b>properties in County Longford have been logged on the website. </p><p>My Department is focused on ensuring that existing housing stock is utilised to its fullest extent including a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland.  In that regard, my Department and local authorities are being proactive in dealing with vacant properties and there are a number of schemes available to incentivise reactivating suitable dwellings into the liveable housing stock.</p><p>The National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy was published in July 2018, it provides a targeted, effective and coordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland. The range of objectives and actions it specifies have been pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock. </p><p>The key drivers of these actions are: local authorities, the Housing Agency, and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by schemes available within my Department specifically designed to tackle vacancy, such as the Repair and Lease Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme and the Long Term Leasing Scheme.</p><p><b>- The Repair  and Leasing Scheme (RLS)</b>is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties. The scheme provides upfront funding to carry out the works and, in return, the property owner agrees to lease the dwelling to the local authority to be used as social housing for a period up to 25 years. The maximum loan for property repair available under the Repair and Lease scheme has been increased by my Department from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000. </p><p><b>- The Buy and Renew</b>initiative allows local authorities to purchase private vacant properties for use as social housing. </p><p><b>- The Housing Acquisitions Fund</b>is a &euro;70 million revolving that was established in January 2017 with the objective of enabling the Housing Agency to acquire vacant units from banks and investment companies for social housing use.  The fund is replenished by the Housing Agency through the sale of units primarily to the AHB sector and the funds received are then recycled back into the fund for future acquisitions. </p><p>The table below gives a breakdown of the number of properties delivered under each of the schemes in Counties Westmeath and Longford. <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority</th>       <th>Repair and Lease Dwellings Delivered Q2 2017 to Q4 2020</th>       <th>Buy and Renew Dwellings Delivered Q2 2017 to Q4 2020</th>       <th>Housing Agency Acquisitions <br /><br />Dwellings Delivered <br /><br />Q2 2017 to Q4 2020</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>11 </td>       <td>7</td>       <td>24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>42</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities. Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.</p><p>While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis, with nine administrative regions in place.  In the Midlands region, Westmeath County Council is the lead authority for the region along with Laois, Longford and Offaly County Councils.  A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  It is a matter for the management group of the consultative forum, in the first instance, to determine the services and the funding required to address homelessness in each region.</p><p>My Department publishes a detailed monthly report on homelessness, based on data provided by housing authorities. The Report outlines details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.  Data relating to homeless adults are presented at a county level.The most recent report, for February 2021, records that there were 10 adults utilising emergency accommodation in county Longford and 26 in Westmeath.  Data on families and dependants are represented on a regional level.  The February report records that there were 17 families in emergency accommodation in the Midlands Region, which combines counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath.</p><p>These Reports are available to access on my Department's website at the following link:  </p></reply>

The Convention is essential in protecting women and girls from violence. The decision to withdraw is a serious backwards step for the protection of women&rsquo;s rights in Turkey, and it sends a disturbing message across Europe and beyond.</p><p>The decision is particularly incomprehensible as it comes on the eve of the tenth birthday of the Convention, and at a time of a pandemic when gender-based violence has spiked all over the world.</p><p>Ireland, and other like-minded States, as well as High Representative Borrell on behalf of the EU, have made clear our deep disappointment at the decision of the Turkish Government and have strongly urged them to reverse this decision.</p><p>This move is unfortunately one of a number of recent backward steps by Turkey on the rule of law and human rights. The recent move to ban the Peoples&rsquo; Democratic Party (HDP), and to therefore potentially deny representation to millions of Turkish voters, is another troubling step, as are the recent actions against students and LGBT groups.</p><p>These actions run counter to Turkey&rsquo;s stated commitment of pursuing a closer relationship with the EU. The EU is built on adherence to fundamental values, including defence of human rights, freedom of expression, and strict respect for the rule of law.

At the most recent session of the UN General Assembly, Ireland supported a Resolution which raised concerns over &quot;increasing restrictions on the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief&quot; in Iran, including for Christians, Baha'i and other religious minorities. The Resolution called on Iran &quot;to eliminate, in law and in practice, all forms of discrimination on the basis of thought, conscience, religion or belief.&quot;</p><p>Ireland has also raised concerns about discrimination against religious minorities on a bilateral basis with Iran, as well as a Member of the EU. </p><p>Ireland, along with the EU, will continue to encourage progress in relation to religious minorities in Iran, and to make clear our concerns to the Iranian authorities. During my visit to Iran on 7 March, I raised concerns over the human rights situation in Iran with Foreign Minister Zarif, and agreed on the need for increased dialogue on human rights issues. </p></reply>

The Council agreed a Presidential Statement on 10 March, condemning the use of violence against peaceful protesters and expressing its continued support for the democratic transition in Myanmar. </p><p>Ireland also continues to engage actively at the UN Human Rights Council. At the recently concluded 46th session of the Council, Ireland delivered over 20 National Statements on a number of country-specific human rights situations including Myanmar, Syria, Iran, Yemen, South Sudan, DPRK, Eritrea, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Ireland also supported a number of Joint Statements on Egypt, Ethiopia, Russia and Venezuela.</p><p>At EU level, Ireland is an active participant and contributor to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy which works globally to support the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of international security.</p><p>Accountability is important not only as a means of pursuing justice for victims, but also as a crucial component to create stability and peace in post-conflict situations.</p><p>Ireland regards the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of the international criminal justice system.

It is the agreed and only solution to address the challenges caused by Brexit on the island of Ireland. </p><p>Our shared goal must be its full implementation. We welcome that the Specialised Committee met on Friday, 26 March. This was an important signal that the only sustainable and legal way forward on implementation is a joint one. The meeting, co-chaired by the EU and the UK, included officials from Ireland and 24 other EU Member States, as well as the Northern Ireland Executive. I hope that there can now be rapid progress towards returning to a cooperative approach that respects commitments made. </p><p>I have regular contact with representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive and political leaders. I also maintain ongoing contacts with British Government counterparts, including with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on these and other matters of common interest. </p><p>I am aware of the practical challenges which some businesses and people in Northern Ireland face arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the Single Market and Customs Union. I, and officials in my Department, continue to engage closely with stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including with business and civil society. We are listening carefully to concerns they have and acting to mitigate the negative impacts of Brexit where possible. </p><p>We want the Protocol to work for Northern Ireland, and for the island as a whole, in as smooth a manner as possible. Ireland has consistently advocated a pragmatic approach to implementation within the existing framework of the Protocol. This is only possible in a spirit of cooperation, through the agreed mechanisms.</p><p>It is important, too, that Northern Ireland is able to benefit from the positive opportunities created by the Protocol with free access to both the EU market of 450 million people, and the UK internal market. This access is unique, vital for operation of all-island supply chains, and offers opportunities for trade, jobs and investment.</p><p>I welcome also Vice President &Scaron;efcovic's recent engagements with stakeholders in Northern Ireland and his commitment to regular contact, clearly demonstrating that the EU is listening to voices across Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs.  The policy can be accessed at </p><p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of the Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS provides its service to schools through casework and through support and development work for schools. Individual casework service involves a high level of psychologist collaboration with teachers and parents, often also working directly with the child/young person.  NEPS may become involved with supporting individual students where the school&rsquo;s Special Education Teaching team or Student Support Team feels that the involvement of the psychologist is needed. Psychologists may provide consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions to be delivered in the school setting and engage in direct work with an individual student as appropriate. </p><p>At post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020/21 school year in response to Covid 19. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  </p><p>In the event that the need for a more specialised intervention or counselling is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist can in consultation with the Guidance Counsellor identify the most appropriate referral pathway and support schools with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  </p><p>In addition to casework NEPS psychologists work with teachers to build their capacity/capability to promote the wellbeing and mental health of children and young people in schools.  NEPS teams offer training and guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, social, emotional and academic development. Initiatives such as the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning Programmes and the FRIENDS Resilience Programmes. These programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.  </p><p>NEPS is currently developing a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which includes trauma informed approaches.  The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. Work is underway to identify schools for inclusion in a pilot of the workshops.In selecting schools, a mix of DEIS, non DEIS and urban and rural schools will be included. Following the pilot a national roll-out is planned during the next academic year. </p></reply>

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  For the 2021/22 school year, an improvement of one point in the appointment threshold in primary schools has been introduced and schools will be provided with class teachers on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils.  A three point reduction in the retention scale has also been introduced for September 2021.  These measures will help to ensure that less pupils are required to recruit or retain a teacher.</p>  <p>  The staffing process contains an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific appeal measure for small schools, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule for the 2021/22 school year, including the appeals process, is available on the Department website.</p></reply>

The desired impact of the SCP is the retention of a young person to Leaving Certificate, equivalent qualification or suitable level of educational attainment which enables them to transition into further education, training or employment. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s investment in 2021 includes providing for; </p><p>- 419 Home School Community Liaison Coordinators serving 539 schools, catering for approximately 156,000 pupils. </p><p>- Additional posts for DEIS Band 1 primary schools to allow for a reduced pupil teacher ratio.</p><p>- Curriculum supports</p><p>- Priority access to continuing professional development</p><p>- School Excellence Fund - DEIS</p><p>- DEIS grants and enhanced book grants. </p><p>As part of the Budget 2021 I announced the following additional measures to tackle educational disadvantage;</p><p>- An extension of the School Completion Programme to include 14 urban primary and 14 post-primary schools newly included in DEIS in 2017, costing &euro;,600,000 in 2021 and &euro;1 million over a full year</p><p>- A 5% increase in funding for the School Completion  Programme to support the attendance and participation of vulnerable learners and those at risk of education disadvantage, costing &euro;780,000 in 2021 and &euro;1.3 million over a full year</p><p>- A reduction of the enrolment threshold for the allocation of an additional Deputy Principal in DEIS post-primary schools, from 700 to 600 pupils allowing for an additional Deputy Principal allocation to 13 DEIS post-primary schools. </p><p>In addition, work is underway in detailing proposals for the provision of a summer programme in 2021 to include  DEIS schools. </p><p>Tusla Education Support Service (TESS), which includes Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, Educational Welfare Officers and School Completion Programme staff play a key role in supporting pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and on supporting the return to school of all students. TESS staff will continue to engage with students and families identified by schools as needing additional support, and will remain in ongoing contact with school principals to identify students who may need support. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for further and higher education falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. I am advised that student supports are in place across further and higher education to make the transition back into education as easy as possible for the individual. Further education and training currently offers opportunities to many young people, through bespoke provision such as Youthreach which is aimed at early school leavers. Most learners on these courses meet the Youth Guarantee criteria. In addition, a young person from the age of 16 can apply to begin an apprenticeship.  </p><p>There has been a significant increase in the numbers of people who now find themselves not in employment, education or training as a result of Covid-19, and who are in need of upskilling. A range of measures were introduced as a response to upskilling and reskilling needs of individuals and businesses through the July Jobs Stimulus and Budget 2021.  These measures are providing 35,000 education and training places at a cost of &euro;100 million to help those who were displaced by the effects of Covid-19. A further 15,000 places were announced as part of the skills package in Budget 2021. Combined these measures include places on the Skills to Complete initiative, Springboard+, the Human Capital Initiative, additional places through Skillnet supported programmes, funding of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation scheme, the roll-out of retrofit training across the country and the expansion of the range of short-duration, part-time and online upskilling and reskilling offerings available for recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.</p><p>Further information can be found at . The Right Course is a one stop shop for businesses, employees or unemployed persons and outlines the further and higher education options and supports available to them. The Right Course website draws together information on the wide range of services available from a variety of state- sponsored agencies and service providers into one central resource. The pages provide signposting to providers and contact details for those seeking further information.&rsquo;</p></reply>

These schools are staffed on the basis of individual pupil profile and the disability categorisations of those pupils, as opposed to being based primarily on school designation, in accordance with my Department's Circular 0032/2019 - Appointment of Administrative Deputy Principal and Staffing in Special Schools.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides an extensive range of supports for pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD).  This includes provision for the establishment of special classes for pupils with SSLD in primary schools. A total of 63 SSLD special classes in mainstream primary schools have been provided for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including applications to establish special classes for SSLD.  Applications meeting the criteria for establishment are approved by the NCSE.  </p>  <p>  The opening and retention of SSLD special classes is, however, contingent on the Health Service Executive (HSE) being in a position to provide speech and language therapy to the students in the class.  The availability and provision of speech and language therapy is the responsibility of the HSE.</p>  <p>  The enrolment of pupils in SSLD special classes is managed locally by an Admissions &amp;amp; Discharges Committee, comprising the Speech and Language Therapy Manager, Speech and Language Therapist, Class Teacher and Principal.   </p>  <p>  As outlined in Circular 0038/2007, eligible pupils may spend up to two years in SSLD classes.</p>  <p>  Students who are not enrolled in a special class for SSLD and who meet the SSLD criteria, as outlined in Circular 0038/2007, may qualify for additional Special Education Teaching (SET) support; as may students with mild speech and language difficulties. The school referred to by the Deputy has an allocation of 136 SET hours per week. It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such students. My Department is not directly involved in these decisions.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently developing Policy Advice on Special Classes and Special Schools. My Department, in conjunction with the NCSE is also considering the existing definition of Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD).  </p>  <p>  There will be no change to the criteria for enrolment in special classes for pupils with speech and language difficulties, pending the outcome of these considerations and the finalisation of the Policy Advice.</p></reply>

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements. </p><p>The NCSE, through its local network of SENOs (Special Educational Needs Organisers), is available to provide advice and support to parents of students on the possible placement options available to their child, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement and special school placement. Post-primary placements are supported with additional resources where required. </p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, I am acutely aware that there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. </p><p>NCSE is aware of those parents whose children are seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements.</p><p>In circumstances, where no placement is available for a child with special educational needs, the Department can provide Home Tuition grant funding towards the provision of 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until the NCSE confirms that a placement is available. </p><p>Special schools do not apply to the NCSE to open additional classes. Since 2012 special schools have been staffed on the basis of their profile, including numbers of students and the disability category of each student. The Class teachers allocated to Special Schools are allocated in accordance with Department of Education Circular 0042/2011. School staffing schedules are reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE who collect up to date details of pupils attending special schools. Accordingly the staffing levels and pupil/teacher ratios reflect the profile of need that exists within an individual school.</p><p>In respect of the school in question I understand that an application for additional accommodation for September 2021 has been submitted to my Department&rsquo;s School Building Unit and is currently being reviewed.</p><p>The NCSE's local Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) remains available to parents and may be contacted directly using the contact details available at: . </p></reply>

Currently, there are 115 Substitute Teacher Supply Panels nationwide, with almost 330 newly appointed Supply Panel teachers employed, providing substitute cover to almost 2,300 schools across the country. The proficiencies of the Substitute Teacher Supply Panels is being monitored throughout the school year and will be reviewed by my Department at the end of the current academic year.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.  This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9740 teachers were allocated. The allocations are based on the profiled needs of schools and are designed to be updated, based on new school profile data, every 2-3 years.  In the interim, additional allocations are made for new schools, or schools which have significantly developing enrolments.</p>  <p>  In order to minimise disruption for schools, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools will be maintained for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.  The Covid-19 pandemic and associated schools closures has hugely adverse consequences for many children and their families. The effect on children with complex special educational needs can be even greater.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, my Department has taken a number of measures to support children with special educational needs during the school closure period. These measures include </p>  <p>  - Providing additional guidance and supports aimed to improve remote learning for children with Special Education Needs in 2020/21 school year</p>  <p>  - Prioritising the return of pupils with special education to school, during the phased reopening of schools </p>  <p>  - Making provision for a supplementary education programme for pupils with special educational needs. The supplementary programme is intended to supplement the teaching and learning provided by the student&rsquo;s school and alleviate the impact of this period of school closure through the provision of one to one in-person teaching or care support to be delivered in homes.</p>  <p>  - My Department is also planning to provide for an enhanced summer programmes this year for children with complex special educational needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>   A number of measures have therefore been taken to support children with special educational during the school closure period, and to support their return to school. There are no plans at this time to increase the number of Special Education Teachers which are allocated to schools. However, as schools reopen, and the effect of school closures on pupils can be assessed, further measures may be introduced, if necessary. </p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  Officials from the department issued invitations for expressions of interest to some 700 primary schools in November 2020. A total of 281 expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.</p>  <p>  The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number. A minimum of one School for each Local Authority area was selected.  Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area. </p>  <p>  As a result of this process, 189 of the 281 schools that submitted an expression of interest were selected, including 4 schools in County Clare, and the 596 children attending these schools will be entitled to receive hot school meals. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, Scoil Chr&iacute;ost R&iacute;, Ennis was not selected and I appreciate that this is disappointing for the school.

FEAD supports EU Member States&rsquo; actions to provide food and material assistance to the most deprived.</p>  <p>  Last year following the closure of the schools as a result of the pandemic restrictions, concern was raised that children from disadvantaged backgrounds might not receive nutritious meals outside of school. The Government decided that funding under the School Meals Programme could be used to support schools which identify pupils who were unlikely to receive nutritious food during the current COVID-19 pandemic and were willing to set up a system to provide children with nutritious food while the schools are closed.  This funding was provided during the summer months and throughout the period of school closures following the move to Level 5 restrictions in late December.  Funding is also available during the current Easter break from 29 March &ndash; 9 April.</p>  <p>  Under the School Meals programme, the Department of Social Protection has committed nearly &euro;1.8 million to 28 schools and organisations in Dublin 11, during the 2020/21 school year.  This benefits over 5,800 children.  More recently last week, Minister Humphreys launched the Hot School Meals Programme 2021, which will benefit some 35,000 pupils in 189 primary schools, a number of which are in the Finglas area.</p>  <p>  FoodCloud is the primary Partner Organisation to deliver the food element of the FEAD Programme and they are responsible for the procurement and storage of the FEAD products, and coordinating collection of the FEAD products by the other Partner Organisations (mainly community-based charities).  There are a number of Local Partner Organisations with access to FEAD products in the North Dublin/Finglas area, including the St Vincent De Paul, Barnardos Finglas and the Finglas Addiction Support Team (FAST).  The Department and FoodCloud have been monitoring the supply and demand for food closely since the outbreak of COVID&ndash;19. If the existing need increases, local partner organisations can apply for an increase in the food/credit allocation by contacting the FEAD Unit (FEAD@welfare.ie) providing an outline of the increased level of demand.</p>  <p>  Looking at food poverty on a broader scale, the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 was published in 2020 and is the national strategy aimed at reducing poverty and increasing social inclusion in Ireland.  The Social Inclusion Roadmap Steering Group is an inter-departmental group which monitors the implementation and progress of Roadmap commitments.  I chair the Steering Group which met for the second time on 30 March 2021.  </p>  <p>  The Roadmap includes a specific commitment for the development of a programme of work to further explore the drivers of food poverty and to identify mitigating actions.  With this in mind, I intend to establish a Working Group to tackle the issue of food poverty.  It is my intention that the group will comprise senior officials from various Government Departments and representatives from relevant NGOs. I believe that this approach will harness the collective efforts of all Departments and tackle the issue of food poverty in a coherent and holistic manner.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for her question and hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

As the employer, CE sponsoring authorities provide fixed-term contracts to both new and existing CE supervisors in line with their annual contractual agreement with the Department.</p>  <p>  Prior to being made redundant by the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society of Ireland CE Scheme, the person concerned had been employed as an Assistant Supervisor during the period 07/05/2012 to 05/07/2013 and as a Supervisor from 08/07/2013 to 04/10/2020.  </p>  <p>  Following an interview process the person concerned was offered a temporary Supervisor position by the sponsoring authority of the Ballyfermot Centre for Children, Young People &amp;amp; Families CE Scheme also known as FamiliBase for an initial 3 month period with effect from 22/02/2021, commencing on Point 1 of the CE Supervisor payscale.</p>  <p>  In 2019 the definition of a new CE supervisor was clarified as being a person who is not currently employed as a CE supervisor.  Where a new CE supervisor has a new employment contract with a new CE sponsoring authority, there is no obligation on the new employer to continue on from any previous remuneration that the employee may have received, either from a former CE employer or any similar position that a new employee may have held. </p>  <p>  All new CE supervisors commence on Point 1 of the appropriate payscale and move by annual increments on the anniversary of their commencement date thereafter, subject to satisfactory performance.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs). </p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. This assistance is subject to the person having the right to reside and satisfying the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC).</p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  The ENP scheme is demand-led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. ENPs are not subject to the HRC. </p><p>The person concerned made an application for SWA on 22/2/2021 and was paid an ENP pending a decision on this application.</p><p>As stated above, in order to qualify for SWA, a person must, inter alia, satisfy the requirement to be habitually resident in the State. The person concerned failed to produce documentation requested by the Designated Officer, including any evidence of the right to reside in the State. As a result, a letter was issued on 18/3/2021 to inform the person concerned that the application was disallowed, and of the right to seek a review or appeal of this decision.</p><p>It has since been confirmed that the person concerned does not hold a valid permission in the State, is the subject of a valid deportation order issued by the Minister for Justice, failed to present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), and is now classed as an evader.

They are responsible for persons recruited and employed by them.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding for CE schemes for training and material costs,  in addition to CE participant and CE supervisor wages. CE sponsoring authorities receive this funding in line with their annual contract with my Department.</p>  <p>  CE supervisors are employed by CE sponsoring authorities, they are not employees of the Department.  As the employer, CE sponsoring authorities provide fixed-term contracts to both new and existing CE supervisors in line with their annual contractual agreement with the Department.  It is important to note that each CE sponsoring authority is an independent employer in their own right.</p>  <p>  In 2019 the definition of a new CE supervisor was clarified as being a person hired by a CE sponsoring authority who is not currently employed as a CE supervisor.  All new CE supervisors commence on Point 1 of the appropriate payscale and move by annual increments on the anniversary of their commencement date thereafter, subject to satisfactory performance.  The change to a CE supervisor&rsquo;s salary referred to in the Deputy's question relates to a situation where a CE supervisor starts with a new employer. It does not relate to an interruption in their employment with their existing employer.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

This survey is conducted by Pobal on behalf of the Department. </p><p>Published data from the 2018/2019 programme year indicates that existing childcare provision, in general, meets current needs nationwide in terms of capacity whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply may exist within this. </p><p>Nationally, capacity and vacant places increased year on year from 2017/2018 (5%) to 2018/2019 (6%). A breakdown of data is available at a local authority level in Dublin, including Dublin City and Fingal. Dublin city had a vacancy rate of 4% in 2018/2019, no change from 4% in 2017/2018. Fingal had a vacancy rate of 5% in 2018/2019, up from 4% in 2017/2018. My Department continues to monitor this data closely.</p><p>My Department also funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees across the country. Part of their role is to advise my Department on capacity issues.</p><p>A key policy objective of my Department is to improve affordability, accessibility and quality of Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC). A 141% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised early learning and care and school-age childcare. It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available.</p><p>First 5, the ten-year whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families pledges to build on this progress. Among key strategic actions in First 5 is a commitment to 'maintain and extend the supply of high-quality publicly subsidised ELC and SAC to best serve the developmental needs of babies and young children, ensuring that it also reflects the needs and preferences of parents and families'.</p><p>To deliver on this strategic action, a range of actions are under way, including an update of the National Planning Guidelines for the development of early learning and care and school-age childcare settings, the extension of regulation to all paid, non-relative childminders on a phased basis and the development of a strategic capital investment plan to deliver large-scale capital investment under Project 2040. The development of a new funding model for EELC and SAC also seeks to address issues of accessibility. First 5 also commits to strengthen capacity to accurately forecast supply and demand for early learning and care and school-age childcare. </p><p>Owing to COVID-19, the publication of Pobal&rsquo;s Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2019/2020 has been delayed. It is expected that the report will be published in mid 2021. </p><p>Planning for the 2020/2021 survey administration is underway, and these data will continue to provide a key input into the Department&rsquo;s work in this area.</p></reply>

The Sixth Interim Report was published in full on 12 January 2021 in line with the commitment I gave to publish this Report in tandem with the Commission's Final Report. I have requested my Department to provide the Deputy with copies of the correspondence between my Department and the Commission in relation to this Report. </p>  <p>  In its Sixth Interim Report, the Commission provided a brief update on its work for the purposes of grounding a request for revision of the timeframe of the final report. Although it was a short report it nonetheless raised complex issues related to the completion of the Commission&rsquo;s programme of work. Notably, the Commission proposed a revised reporting arrangement to facilitate a phased completion of its report. On the basis of legal advices available to the then Minister, the Government agreed to a limited extension until 26 June 2020 in order to allow the Commission to complete all its work and submit a final report. </p>  <p>  The Report identified challenges relating to the redaction, transfer and potential for future use of the Commission's records in the context of its obligations under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. The Sixth Interim Report was not immediately published to facilitate further deliberation and engagement with the Commission in relation to these important matters. As the Deputy will be aware, I subsequently brought forward the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Bill 2020 to resolve these matters. This bespoke legislation was enacted in October 2020 to protect all the Commission's records and ensure legal clarity on their transfer and future use. </p>  <p>  The Sixth Interim Report also enclosed a detailed technical archaeological report relating to burials at Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co. Tipperary. At the time, the then Minister was advised by the Office of the Attorney General that this technical report had to be returned as it constituted evidence to the Commission. This was done and all copies of the technical report were destroyed by the Department.  The technical report was included in the Commission's final report.  </p></reply>

In December 2020, I began a short process to examine the possibility of regulating the pay and conditions of employment of practitioners in early learning and care and school-age childcare, and to examine the suitability of establishing a JLC. In agreement with IBEC/CSI and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.</p>  <p>  Following a series of meetings that concluded in early February, Dr Duffy has now submitted his report on the process. The report concludes that all parties agreed that the establishment of a JLC is the most appropriate means by which pay and conditions of employment in the sector can be addressed.</p>  <p>  On foot of this, I have written to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector. If established, a JLC would provide an opportunity for relevant parties to engage in negotiations on an Employment Regulation Order which could ultimately establish binding rates of pay and conditions for the sector.</p>  <p>  Under the Industrial Relations Act 1946, the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail has the power to apply to the Labour Court for the establishment of a JLC, and it is the statutory role of the Labour Court to determine the appropriateness of establishing a JLC in a given sector.</p></reply>

It aims to prevent risks to children and young people arising or escalating through building sustainable services within Tusla and partner organisations to perform preventative and early intervention work. The programme addresses Tusla&rsquo;s statutory requirement under the Child and Family Agency Act to provide &lsquo;preventative family support services aimed at promoting the welfare of children&rsquo;. PPFS works to build connectivity by engaging with Tusla and external services across the continuum of care. </p>  <p>  Tusla has established 118 Child &amp;amp; Family Support Networks (CFSNs) across Ireland, which help to support integrated and co-ordinated supports for children, young people and families at local community level.  CFSNs are a frontline operational structure set up by Tusla to support integrated service delivery. Members of CFSNs come from a variety of agencies or local voluntary and community services such as the Community and Voluntary Sector, HSE Primary Care Social Work, Early Years Services, Sports Clubs, Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapy, An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, Youth Probation Services, Primary and Secondary Schools etc. There are three CFSN networks in South Tipperary, and South Tipperary PPFS continues to develop as do other PPFS services across the country in line with available resources.</p>  <p>  In practical terms, if a family presents to one service within the Child &amp;amp; Family Support Network and that service is not equipped to meet their needs, that network member can effectively re-direct the family to the most appropriate network member(s) or service. To be able to do this, CFSNs develop a good understanding and become familiar with one another&rsquo;s work. The CFSNs also facilitate the coordination of the use of Meitheal, the Tusla-led early intervention national practice model that identifies a child&rsquo;s and their families&rsquo; needs and strengths, and brings together a team around the child to deliver preventative support. </p>  <p>  South Tipperary follows this model and has a Senior CFSN Coordinator in place. Tusla commissions services from its community and voluntary sector funded partners, including the Family Resource Centres, based on identified need. The Senior Manager for PPFS would have a key role in identifying the need for these community based services and oversees related service level agreements. </p></reply>

Within the meaning of these Acts, HEIs are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs including dealing with policy and procedure in relation to fee collection.  My Department therefore has no role in relation to such matters.</p><p>It is not intended that the reform of the HEA legislation will include any provisions which will amend the autonomy of institutions to determine such policies.</p><p>However, I am very aware of the difficulties facing students during this pandemic.  I would encourage all higher education institutions to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that most HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. I would encourage all institutions to engage with students in relation to any issues,including fees. </p><p>From my Department's perspective, students who avail of the SUSI grant have received a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution. </p><p>Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.  </p><p>Students experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Office of the institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

These reforms have been designed to:</p><p>- tackle abuse of the immigration regime,</p><p>- tackle abuse of the labour market,</p><p>- improve the overall quality of offering to international students,</p><p>- improve protection for learners,</p><p>- safeguard the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers in line with the goals of Ireland&rsquo;s international education strategy.</p><p>As part of these reforms, further education programmes are no longer eligible for student immigration purposes. All Higher Education Institutions and English language education providers who wish to recruit non-EEA students must meet with relevant criteria and be listed on the ILEP in order to do so. The ILEP details the education programmes considered to justify the granting of permission to non-EEA students to live and work in Ireland. </p><p>The ILEP was introduced in January 2016 and is administered by the Department of Justice in association with my Department.

A response has been submitted to the U.S. Embassy for onwards transmission to the State Department, and officials are in regular communication with the Embassy to answer follow up queries and provide further input as required in that dialogue.</p><p>Our response to this year's Questionnaire outlines a number of measures that we have progressed in order to tackle human trafficking in Ireland.</p><p>The initiatives progressed by my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the last year clearly demonstrate our commitment to tackling this heinous crime.  Among the measures highlighted in our response is the funding my Department has committed to NGOs working to combat human trafficking.  The details are set out in the tables below.</p><p>The response also highlights the priority actions being taken to ensure victims of trafficking are identified, protected, and provided with all the supports needed. To this end a new wider National Referral Mechanism is being created to protect and promote the human rights of trafficking victims. The supports available under the NRM include accommodation, medical care, care planning, legal advice and aid, immigration permission, police services, employment and vocational training, translation and interpretation services and voluntary return home. I intend to bring proposals for a new NRM to Government this month.</p><p>My Department is also working with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Ireland on a Cultural Mediation project.  The project will build the capacity of State professionals who work with or for migrants, to identify and address the needs of victims or potential victims of gender based violence and trafficking more effectively and to provide culturally sensitive support to them. It will also provide victims of gender based violence and trafficking better access to information and allow them to effectively engage with support and referral services.  It will also promote a culturally sensitive approach to victims, through the use of cultural mediators. <table>    <tr>       <th>Core Funding</th>       <th>Amount</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ruhama including COVID</td>       <td>&euro;609,868</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ruhama Exit   Pathways</td>       <td>&euro;27,620</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MRCI</td>       <td>&euro;83,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IOM Cultural Mediation Service   Project II</td>       <td>&euro;250,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dormant Account Funding</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IOM</td>       <td>&euro;30,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Awareness Raising/Frontline Training</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Migrant Rights Centre Ireland </th>       <th>&euro;28,754   to develop information resources and training on awareness of Human   Trafficking for labour exploitation</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Immigrant Council of Ireland</td>       <td>&euro;35,000   for development and delivery of introductory and advanced online training   modules on awareness raising of human trafficking in Ireland</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MECPATHS</td>       <td>&euro;20,398   for development and delivery of online education and awareness raising of   human trafficking in Ireland to frontline professionals and students within   the hospitality and services sectors and now for the aviation sector</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DORAS</td>       <td>&euro;23,552  for development and delivery of training and information resources on awareness   raising of human trafficking aimed at frontline staff and volunteers to build   capacity</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

A number of suggestions were made by the group regarding the processing of applications and these are under active consideration. The engagement process, which has been very positive and productive, is ongoing. It has provided my officials with valuable customer insights on our service standards and procedures.</p>  <p>  On 18 January 2021, I was pleased to announce a temporary system that enables citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. </p>  <p>  This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during COVID-19. The Citizenship Division of my Department is communicating with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis. </p>  <p>  Under the temporary new system, up to 4,000 qualifying applicants are currently being asked to complete a statutory declaration that is sent to them by email from the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department and bring it to one of the listed designated officials. The designated official must witness the applicant sign the statutory declaration. The applicant must then send the signed statutory declaration, the appropriate fee and any other requested documentation to Citizenship Division. Final processing will then take place and a certificate of naturalisation, will be sent to the applicant.</p>  <p>  My Department expects to continue the current statutory declaration process beyond March and we are aiming to have communicated with an additional 2,500 applicants in the system by the end of June. </p>  <p>  To date, 3,615 communications have issued, 1,605 declarations had been returned and  887 certificates of naturalisation have already issued. More will issue in the coming weeks once the final processing of the returned declarations is completed. </p>  <p>  It remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow. Since their establishment in 2011, citizenship ceremonies have been joyous occasions which mark the granting of Irish citizenships in a dignified manner and they have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. In-person ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured. </p></reply>

The significant level of funding provided over recent years is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As a result, there are now approximately 14,600 Garda members and over 3,000 Garda staff nationwide.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is responsible under the law for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources.  As Minister, I have no role in such decisions.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use. </p><p>The table below, which has been provided to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the number of community Garda&iacute; assigned to Wicklow Division as at end December 2016  to end December 2020 and as at 28 February 2021, the latest date for which figures are available. </p><p> </p><p>A detailed breakdown of the Garda workforce, including the national distribution of Community Garda&iacute;, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, in the interests of transparency and for the convenience of Deputies and the wider public.  This information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Information requested in relation to Community Garda may be accessed along with information about the wider Garda workforce at the following link:</p><p>It is important to note that to date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that it is important to consider that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  Indeed, this is fundamental to the new Garda Operating Model recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and currently being rolled out under 'A Policing Service for Our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the Commission's recommendations.</p></reply>

Of these cases, 125 persons were hospitalised and 17 have been admitted to ICU.  Sadly, there has been a  total of 8 deaths due to Covid-19 among Travellers during this period.  </p><p>The high incidence of Covid-19 outbreaks among Travellers is concerning and reflects two main factors: the basic living conditions in which Travellers live - the social determinants of health - and the tradition of family and communal events, such as funerals and christenings. </p><p>Both the Department of Health and the HSE pro-actively monitor and respond to Covid-19 among the Traveller population. The HSE has prioritised Travellers in terms of detection, case management and contact tracing.  The following measures were introduced by the HSE national social inclusion office and public health:-</p><p>- Traveller Support plans developed in relevant CHO areas;</p><p>- regular teleconferences held with Traveller Health Units to develop guidance for Travellers;</p><p>- introduction of a national Traveller helpline; </p><p>- development of Traveller specific guidance document which gives general advice about preventing the spread of COVID-19 and dealing with cases of COVID-19); </p><p>- development of specific local supports in  various CHOs to support Travellers, for example, the Community Assessment Hub in the Mater Hospital is accessible to Travellers;</p><p>- national COVID-19 Traveller Service User Experience survey carried out in September 2020, which will help  inform service planning throughout the ongoing pandemic,</p><p>- website resource page developed with information and resources specifically for Travellers Traveller COVID 19 sharing resources.</p><p>- A National Traveller Outbreak Control Team with representatives from relevant stakeholders including Pavee Point,</p><p>In addition to the specific public health measures, the steering ctte of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy provides regular updates on the whole of Government response to Covid-19 for Travellers. The Dept of the Taoiseach subcommittee on higher risk groups also monitors the situation for Travellers.</p><p>The roll out of the COVID-19 vaccination programme will make a significant advance in our approach to this pandemic. People at highest risk of suffering, and most vulnerable to the worst effects of COVID-19, are prioritised as part of this listing. People aged 16-64 from disadvantaged groups living in congregated settings are prioritised in group 9. This includes people from the Travelling community. </p><p>The HSE has hosted webinar on the roll out of the vaccination programme and developed Traveller specific vaccination programme resources.  </p><p>I am aware that the poor health status of the Traveller community makes them more vulnerable to the health complications associated with Covid-19.  The HSE is finalising its national Traveller health action plan and will shortly submit the plan to the Department. I am committed to supporting this plan. </p></reply>

The OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.  The OPAP does not provide for the introduction of a Public Health Obesity Act.  However, the Plan does provide for a mid-term review to be carried out, and this will take place in 2021.  This will lead to a refreshed and updated Plan with a revised set of actions for the remaining lifetime of the OPAP.  This review provides the opportunity to consider developments and new evidence since the publication of the OPAP and allow appropriate consideration and stakeholder engagement on a range of aspects, including proposed legislation to support our national approach to tackling obesity.</p><p>There are a number of elements which will inform the mid-term review of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan.  An Implementation Progress Report on the actions within the Plan was published in February 2021.  A Strategic Action Plan for the wider Healthy Ireland Framework, covering the years 2021-2025 is expected to be published in the coming weeks.  An evaluation of the OPAP is also being carried out by the Health Research Board Centre for Health and Diet Research, University College Cork.  This process will include the assessment of relevant experts, and it is expected that this will be completed in the second quarter of 2021.  A strong evidence base will be required for any new legislative measures, and the review of the OPAP will build on the work already underway to identify gaps in the implementation of the Plan, including where actions need to be progressed, whether by legislative or other means, and where further research is required.  </p><p>Given the multi-faceted nature of the obesity crisis, a high level of interdepartmental collaboration will be required to implement measures aimed at tackling obesity and in the preparation and implementation of legislation, and as envisaged in the Programme for Government, extensive stakeholder consultation would of course be necessary.  However, the work which Healthy Ireland has undertaken over the years in identifying and developing relationships with stakeholders, and most recently through the development of the Strategic Action Plan, provide a strong basis upon which to work with stakeholders to examine the issues and implications involved.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30<sup>th</sup>of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:</p></reply>

The report found that barriers to accessing contraception do exist for some people and that these barriers go beyond cost to include embarrassment, lack of knowledge, inconvenience and lack of local access.  At the same time, the report was clear that contraception use in Ireland is high and stable. </p>  <p>  Eligibility for access to contraceptive products is currently governed by the same eligibility framework as applies more broadly in the Irish healthcare system, and the supports available to individuals in terms of mitigating the cost of LARCs are also the same.  </p>  <p>  Those who hold a medical card can access contraception, including LARCs, free of charge except for a &euro;1.50 per item prescription charge levied at the pharmacy. In addition, those who possess GP visit cards can see their doctor without charge, effectively removing the clinical cost associated with LARCs, although the individual would still have to pay for the product itself. </p>  <p>  For those not in possession of either a medical card or GP visit card, contraception is considered as an out-of-pocket expense.  However, the Drug Payment Scheme covers in full the cost of prescribed medication in excess of &euro;114 a month for an individual or family which can serve to limit this cost.</p>  <p>  Despite the delay caused by the need to focus on and prioritise the response to the current pandemic, it remains a commitment of this Government to provide free contraception over a phased period, beginning with women aged 17-25. </p></reply>

The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30<sup>th</sup>of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and the Department of Health, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details are available here:</p></reply>

In March 2020, the Department of Health published the <i>Ethical Framework for Decision-making in a Pandemic</i>, setting out these principles. This Framework can be found online: . </p><p>The NPHET, in considering and making recommendations on COVID-19 restrictions, is at all times guided by these ethical principles, including proportionality. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, Ireland&rsquo;s epidemiological situation remains uncertain as a number of disease indicators are now static or potentially disimproving. Ireland is still experiencing high levels of infection across the country and the health service remains under pressure. Level 5 restrictive measures therefore remain in place. Any measures introduced are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities. </p><p>On 30<sup></sup>March the Government announced a slight easing of restrictions from 12 April in recognition of the significant impact that the extended period of Level 5 restrictions is having on people. The focus of this slight easing of measures is on enabling more outdoor activities so as to improve the health and wellbeing of society.

The GMHS website and other resources such as www.man2man.ie  and www.sexualwellbeing.ie  are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved STI and PrEP services. </p>  <p>  All PrEP service providers have maintained existing PrEP service users in the programme, providing virtual consultations, postal prescriptions and attendance for screening or treatment where necessary. It is difficult to predict the level of any number of infectious diseases including STIs that will occur post pandemic, but with the resumption of normal service, there is an expectation that increased testing will bring increased diagnoses.</p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to progress a number of initiatives that aim to reduce the level of HIV and STIs nationally and improve access to services for those in need.</p>  <p>  - The promotion of safer sex messages to the public via a range of social media platforms including twitter, facebook and Instagram. </p>  <p>  - During the pandemic, the public has been advised about STI clinic restrictions and encouraged to consider safer sexual practices to reduce the risk of HIV and STI transmission. </p>  <p>  - Those who are symptomatic are advised to contact a clinic directly for an emergency appointment. </p>  <p>  - Guidance was issued around sex and COVID-19 which advised the public to limit numbers of partners to reduce transmission of HIV/STIs as well as COVID-19 during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  - Condoms are freely available to NGO partners and service providers via the National Condom Distribution service and a number of NGOs established postal services to make condoms and lubricant accessible to service users throughout the pandemic while venues were closed.</p>  <p>  - Free rapid HIV testing is available in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick through community NGO partners HIV Ireland, Sexual Health Centre Cork, Sexual Health West and GOSHH. NGO partners have adapted their services and are currently providing free rapid HIV testing from their offices or alternative venues.   </p>  <p>  - STI/HIV testing is currently available through a HSE home STI testing pilot project in Dublin, Cork and Kerry. Tests are being made available in a phased manner to ensure there is sufficient capacity in local clinics for service users who may need follow-up treatment or support.</p>  <p>  At the outset of Covid-19, staff in the Gay Men&rsquo;s Health Service were reassigned, by reason of necessity, to other HSE services. Some staff continue to be redeployed to Covid-19 services, including to the COVID-19 vaccination programme which commenced in recent months. COVID-19 has placed increased demands on HSE services which are required to be delivered in accordance with current restrictions. </p>  <p>  Community Healthcare East re-opened the GMHS in January 2021 on a phased basis, and in line with Government and HSE Guidelines. Existing PrEP users continue to be seen in the GMHS. The Clinic&rsquo;s Consultant in Infectious Diseases (Gay Men&rsquo;s Health service (GMHS) and GUIDE Clinic, St James&rsquo;s Hospital) and other doctors are providing virtual consultations and PrEP service users attend the GMHS for STI screening and blood testing. Those with diagnosed STIs, or requiring Hepatitis and/or HPV vaccine, continue to be treated in GMHS also. </p>  <p>  Previously the GMHS relied heavily on agency staff. This is no longer the situation. The funding allocated to the HSE in respect of the GMHS PrEP programme was received in 2020 as recurring funding. This has facilitated a recruitment campaign to fill the posts for the GMHS PrEP programme to commence in the latter part of 2020. This recruitment is ongoing.</p>  <p>  HSE Community Healthcare East will continue to reinstate services in the GMHS on a phased basis and in line with the HSE&rsquo;s Safe Return to Health Services. HSE Community Healthcare East has made every effort to restore, and maintain services as far as possible and will continue to do so, subject to current demand for health services, and subject to resources available.</p>  <p>  Decisions concerning the provision of sexual health services are made in line with the objectives and strategic vision of the National Sexual Health Strategy 2015 - 2020 (NSHS), which aims to improve sexual health and wellbeing and reduce negative sexual health outcomes by ensuring that everyone living in Ireland has access to high quality sexual health information, education and services throughout their lives.</p>  <p>  The current Strategy was intended to cover the period from 2015 &ndash; 2020, but has now been extended to 2021. It is the intention of my Department to conduct stakeholder consultations and a review of the NSHS this year. The outcome of the consultations and the review will determine the future direction of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the HSE is currently piloting a free home STI/HIV testing service, supported by the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund, in Dublin, Cork and Kerry. The first phase of tests was made available early January 2021. As a result of very high initial demand for the service, tests will now be made available in a phased manner to ensure there is sufficient capacity in local clinics for service users who may need follow-up treatment or support. </p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the manner and location of future sexual health services will be made in the context of the above factors. </p></reply>

Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.</p><p>While the current guidance provides for visiting on critical and compassionate grounds, this new guidance now expands the scope of visiting on general compassionate grounds. It also refines the guidance across Levels 1 to 5, which now provides for increased visiting at Levels 3, 4 and 5, subject to risk assessment and no open outbreak. </p><p>Residents may be facilitated to receive:</p><p>- <b>Two visits per week</b>where 8 out of 10 of every resident and healthcare worker in the nursing home has completed their vaccination schedule. </p><p>- <b></b>There is no requirement to limit visits to less than one hour. </p><p>I have written to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the need for all providers to follow the revised guidance on visitation. The adoption of a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the key role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing must be sustained. I expect every effort to be made to ensure visits are facilitated to the greatest extent possible, in line with the revised guidance and public health advice. Providers are also encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.</p><p>In addition, I have requested that in the ongoing monitoring, regulatory and inspection processes, that the Chief Inspector of Social Services (HIQA) would place a particular focus, as appropriate, on the visiting arrangements in place.  I have requested that, in the event that the Chief Inspector evidences any concerns of a systemic nature, that the Department would be kept informed of the issues and proposed responses to same.</p><p>Finally, the Department of Health also wrote to the representative body for private and voluntary nursing homes on  24<sup>th</sup>of March, emphasising the importance of all long-term residential care services making every effort to fully apply the suite of guidance that has been made available, to support providers to meet their obligations in this regard.</p></reply>

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p><p>Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. </p><p>This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I requested a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny from the Business Committee, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il, and this waiver was granted on 4th February 2021. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. It is on the priority list for publication in the Spring legislative session. The Bill will be enacted upon completion of all stages in the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President. </p></reply>

Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP. As of 1 March 2021, there are no GMS GP vacancies in County Clare.</p>  <p>  The Government, aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice. These include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday as well as the introduction of supports for rural GP practices.</p>  <p>  Following agreement with GPs in 2019 on a range of service developments and reforms, the Government has committed to increasing investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) over the period 2019 and 2023.</p>  <p>  The Agreement provides for significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease programme. There is also increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas as well as improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.</p>  <p>  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 214 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021. The ICGP noted a record number of applications for the 2021 GP training programme.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p></reply>

These centres, which are opening in areas where the number of positive cases is particularly high, will allow people who don&rsquo;t have symptoms of COVID-19 to get a free test without having to contact their GP first. Around 20% of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic.</p><p>The testing centres will be open from Thursday, 25 March to Wednesday, 31 March from 11am to 7pm. Social distancing measures will apply as people turn up for testing.</p><p>Testing people with no symptoms will help to find positive cases earlier, will help in breaking chains of transmission and will help us better understand how and why the virus is spreading quicker in certain areas.</p><p>The initial locations at Blanchardstown, Grangegorman, Irishtown, Tallaght and Tullamore have been decided based on local disease prevalence and public health director&rsquo;s advice. The locations will change week-on-week.

Working with the National Ambulance Service, the HSE aims to carry out 300-500 COVID-19 tests per day at each walk-in centre. Any detected cases will be referred to contact tracing in the same way as detected cases that were referred through by a GP.</p><p>On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population.

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>On 23 March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;. This plan outlines a three phased plan for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met.</p><p>Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first.</p><p>Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p><p>The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2019. At the end of February 2021 there were 4,317 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,276 in February 2019.</p><p>The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the NTPF. This includes increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation. </p><p>&euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as to address waiting lists.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy regarding the waiting time for cataract treatment by county is outlined at the following link.  This data provides the number of patients by time band on the cataract waiting list by county/area of residence.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.</p></reply>

The Programme is an evidence based, incentivised healthy eating programme which is rolled out to children over three years: Year 1 is based on a 16 day intervention programme followed up by maintenance programmes in Years 2 and 3 and is underpinned by strong accompanying educational measures. It is managed by Bord Bia and has the support of a wide range of national stakeholders including the Department of Health, the Department of Education and the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>The Programme is funded annually by the EU Commission with supporting national funding from my Department's budget as available. The total EU budget for the scheme, in the period 2017-2023, is &euro;250 million per school year of which up to &euro;150 million is for fruit and vegetables and up to &euro;100 million for milk.

The scheme is open to pre-schools, primary schools and secondary schools, and a portion of fresh drinking milk (189ml approximately) is distributed to each participating child on a daily basis. The Scheme is supported by strong educational accompanying measures to educate children about the health and nutritional benefits of milk.

Additional resources have been recruited and training, information and guidance has been provided to both Departmental staff and registered foresters and, as a result, we have seen gains in terms of output.</p>  <p>  The introduction of Project Woodland, recently launched by Minister-of-State Pippa Hackett, with responsibility for forestry, is our strategy for resolving the licensing issues. This new structure aims to ensure that the current backlog is addressed. The Project involves a review and refresh of our processes and procedures and includes outside stakeholder participation to bring an independent perspective. It is a task-driven process, with clear deliverable and milestones.</p>  <p>  Working Group 1 under Project Woodland is specifically tasked with reducing the backlog and then plotting a trajectory to achieve this target. The recommendation in Ms Jo O'Hara's Implementation Report is that this Group publish a process to achieve these targets, including prioritisation and scheduling and that a monthly dashboard show the outcome of this process against the target trajectory.  Meanwhile, Working Group 4 will address Effective Processes, which will include clearer explanations for the statutory basis for forestry regulation and  the introduction of more efficient and effective processes. I expect there will be cross-cutting issues between these two groups.</p>  <p>  A target to issue 4,500 licences in 2021 has been set which is a 74% increase on 2020.</p>  <p>As regards current output, since the beginning of the year, my Department has issued 518 tree felling licences, for 1.624 million cubic metres of timber. This is an increase of almost 20% in the number of felling licences issued in Q1 2020. There are currently 4,576 tree felling licence applications awaiting decision, which includes a batch application by Coillte of 1,864 licences advertised on 19th March. The average time to decision for tree felling licence applications received is 13 months.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there are always licences in the system at various stages of processing. These are the initial stages of an application being made, while the registered forester finalises application documents to referral to prescribed bodies. referral to the inspector and/or ecologist/archaeologist, to making final decision. Applications may also be returned to the applicant (and their registered forester, where relevant) for further information.</p>  <p>  I remain hopeful and confident that the changes presented under the Project Woodland structure to processes within my Department will bear fruit, particularly to give confidence to all applicants that they can receive a timely decision on their forestry licence application.</p></reply>

Such a system did not exist in Ireland at that time. The applicable legislative framework in Ireland has never  extended rights to issue a veterinary prescription to any other professional other than a veterinarian. Therefore, my Department's view is that Ireland is not in a position to retrospectively avail of this derogation. This view has been informed through consideration and analysis by policy officials, consultation with the EU Commission and with internal legal advisors.</p>  <p>  However, given the range of views on Article 105(4), my Department committed to seeking further legal advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office which was submitted in late 2020 and is receiving attention in that office currently.</p>  <p>  The concerns specifically focus on the legislation as it impacts on the supply of anti-parasitic veterinary medicines, which here-to-fore were exempt from the need for a prescription and which route of supply was recently changed to requiring a prescription by the Health Product Regulatory Authority.

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took over responsibility for the Fishery Harbour Centres (FHCs) in October 2007. Ros an Mh&iacute;l is one of six Fishery Harbour Centres, the others are located at Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East, Howth and Killybegs.</p><p>Funding is made available on an annual basis by my Department to the FHCs, including Ros an Mh&iacute;l, via the Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme. A phased programme for the infrastructural development of Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC has been progressed over the last number of years, which has seen a significant investment. In total, approx &euro;31.6m has been invested in capital developments at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC between 2000 and 2020.</p><p>The possibility of a deep-water berthing project at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC has been mooted for some time.</p><p>In 2018, the Department commissioned engineering consultants to undertake a review of the design solutions, scoping options and operational aspects of a possible future project. An interim draft of the Quay Wall Peer Review Report was received in April 2019. This report identified the need for additional site investigations to be carried out in Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC. These site investigation works were carried out in August/September 2019 and have now been completed. </p><p>The final Quay Wall Peer Review report was received on 27<sup>th</sup>July 2020 and a further update was issued on 4<sup>th</sup>September 2020. The Department is considering this report in full, including the site investigation results, to inform a future assessment of possible design solutions and scoping options, which will, in themselves, inform any future decisions on progressing this project. Planning permission had been obtained for this project, this permission has been extended to April 2023.</p><p>As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres generally, any future decision with regard to formally initiating this project in Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC, will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

Additional resources have been recruited and training, information and guidance has been provided to both Departmental staff and registered foresters and, as a result, we have seen gains in terms of output.</p><p>The introduction of Project Woodland, recently launched by Minister-of-State Pippa Hackett, with responsibility for forestry, is our strategy for resolving the licensing issues. This new structure aims to ensure that the current backlog is addressed. The Project involves a review and refresh of our processes and procedures and includes outside stakeholder participation to bring an independent perspective.  It is a task-driven process, with clear deliverable and milestones.</p><p>Working Group 1 under Project Woodland is specifically tasked with reducing the backlog and then plotting a trajectory to achieve this target. The recommendation in Ms Jo O'Hara's Implementation Report is that this Group publish a process to achieve these targets, including prioritisation and scheduling and that a monthly dashboard show the outcome of this process against the target trajectory. Meanwhile, Working Group 4 will address Effective Processes, which will include clearer explanations for the statutory basis for forestry regulation and  the introduction of more efficient and effective processes. I expect there will be cross-cutting issues between these two groups.</p><p>A target to issue 4,500 licences in 2021 has been set which is a 75% increase on 2020.</p><p>I remain hopeful and confident that the changes presented under the Project Woodland structure to processes within my Department will bear fruit, particularly to give confidence to all applicants that they can receive a timely decision on their forestry licence application.</p><p>The tables below show the average time taken to decide on an application received for each of the three categories of licence, broken down by the year received, for 2018 to 2020. </p><p>It is worth noting that there are always licences in the system at various stages of processing. These are the initial stages of an application being made, while the registered forester finalises application documents to referral to prescribed bodies, referral to the inspector and/or ecologist/archaeologist, to making final decision. Applications may also be returned to the applicant (and their registered forester, where relevant) for further information.</p><p>The average time taken for a decision to issue on a felling application, averaged over the last three years was seven months. The average time an undecided felling licence has been in the system is 13 months.</p><p>The average time taken for a decision to issue on an afforestation application, averaged over the last three years was six months. The average time an undecided afforestation licence has been in the system is 17 months.</p><p>The average time taken for a decision to issue on a Forest Road application, averaged over the last three years was six months. The average time an undecided Forest Road licence has been in the system is 15 months.</p><p>Felling <table>    <tr>       <th>Year Received </th>       <th>Avg.

This position is supported by many publications including &lsquo;Sitka spruce in Ireland, Joyce, P.M. and OCarroll, N. 2002, and by &lsquo;The distribution and productivity of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) in Ireland in relation to site, soil and climatic factors&rsquo;. Farrelly N. et al 2009. and the Code of Best Forest Practice - Ireland (2000).</p><p>Prior to the decision to restrict planting of unenclosed land, a number of well-known studies supported the position that habitat types associated with unenclosed land are more environmentally sensitive than enclosed land. For example, various studies including &lsquo;Phosphorus release from forest harvesting on an upland blanket peat catchment by Rodgers <i>et al</i>in 2010 established that peat soils do not buffer phosphate in the same way mineral soils do and that there will be a release of phosphate into receiving waters post-harvesting, even with the installation of protective setbacks along watercourses.</p><p>Concerns also existed in relation to the importance of unenclosed land for forging and breeding by a wide range of protected bird species (e.g. Hen harrier). Similarly, concerns existed in relation to undesignated Annex 1 habitats such as wet and dry heath, and highly endangered protected species such as freshwater pearl mussel, whose lifecycle is dependent on natural habitats typically associated with unenclosed land. Such environmental issues were discussed at this time with the European Commission.</p><p>At the time, another consideration was the fact that many plantations on unenclosed land that received grant and premium aid failed and the Department often engaged with the applicant to recoup the monies paid.</p><p>The planting on unenclosed land will be reviewed in the context of Project Woodland.</p></reply>

These supports include funding to carry out applied research through the National Apiculture Programme, grants to national beekeeping associations and grant aid to fund capital investments for beekeepers. My Department has funded a number of studies under the Genetic Research Grant Aid Scheme looking at various aspects of this honeybee species and specifically apis mellifera melliferra. In 2021, funding has been allocated for an innovative queen rearing project.</p>  <p>  In relation to the importation of honeybees into Ireland, this is allowed under regulations governing intra-Community trade with other EU Member States. The specific health requirements for trading in bees are laid out in Council Directive 92/65/EEC. All imports of bees must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the country of export after a physical inspection of the bees and their packaging has taken place. This is to ensure that imported bees are healthy and do not harbour pathogens or parasites that may be harmful to our native bee stocks.</p>  <p>  The importation of bees into the UK via Northern Ireland is a UK internal matter.</p></reply>

This is true regardless of the separation distance between the project and the European site(s).</p><p>A likely zone of impact is used in order to identify those European Sites to be specifically addressed during screening. In making a decision regarding the likelihood of a project having a significant effect on a European Site(s), all European Sites within a certain radius (or &lsquo;likely zone of impact&rsquo;) should be considered at screening stage, in addition to hydrologically-connected European Sites. For example, in relation to a Special Protection Area, it is important to consider whether the project area lies within the foraging distance of bird species for which that SPA was designated, and many of these foraging distances exceed 3km.</p><p>This was one of the reasons why 3km was not deemed appropriate. There were a number of factors which prompted the Department to make the change in mid-2019. We were advised by our Ecology consultants that our appropriate assessment screening decisions would be vulnerable to challenge if we continued to consider at screening stage only those European Sites within 3km. Practice in other land use sectors where appropriate assessment screening is required is also to provide for a 15km likely zone of impact. Furthermore, results on individual cases heard by the FAC also indicated that the 3km radius was not appropriate.</p><p>My Department are in close contact with their counterparts in the NPWS and they are aware of our screening process. The document referred is currently under review by the NPWS.I can assure you that each file is assessed on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

The ultimate aim of these innovation partnerships is to road-test new ideas and practices which can be used more widely by farmers and others to improve productivity, enhance resource efficiency and pursue sustainable farming practices. These EIPs are pilot projects and, as such, are restricted in the number of farmers that they can accept  into their schemes.</p>  <p>  The Department approved applications for funding, following a competitive open call for proposals under the EIP Initiative.  In their application for funding under the open call, each project group indicated, based on their capacity, the level of funding required to carry out the pilot project including funding for the number of farmers that they planned to involve in each project. In successful EIPs, such as the one referred to, it may be the case that not all interested farmers can be accommodated within the pilot project.</p>  <p>  Existing EIP groups have been working hard on the actions in their proposals and have built a deep understanding of the impacts these works are having on biodiversity and habitat quality. The results of this work to date will be invaluable in negotiating the next CAP and in programme design for these sensitive areas in the next CAP Strategic Plan.</p>  <p>  We are currently making plans for new and expanded EIPs in the next CAP and we are engaging with stakeholders on the design of these through the CAP consultation process.</p></reply>

This roadmap sets out a series of ambitious actions for the next decade and beyond which will be transformative for Irish agriculture. The roadmap will enable the sector to reduce agricultural GHG emissions by 10-15%, while maintaining, and indeed, hopefully increasing agricultural output through efficiency gains over the years ahead.</p>  <p>  One of the major objectives of AgClimatise is an overall reduction in chemical nitrogen fertiliser use to 325,000 tonnes by 2030, a key objective of the EU Farm-to-Fork Strategy. The roadmap places significant emphasis on measures that will maintain grass productivity with reduced levels of chemical fertiliser use. These measures include an increased use of lime on farms, the use of clover and other multispecies swards and a greater uptake of low emission slurry spreading technology. The Teagasc Signpost farms initiative, along with the many public and private advisors, will play a key role in up skilling farmers over the years ahead.</p>  <p>  By implementing the Ag Climatise roadmap over the course of the next decade, I am very confident that we can transition the sector to a more long term sustainable platform, with co-benefits for water, air quality and biodiversity, while at all times, maintaining productivity in the sector.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, I want to ensure that, as a priority, we protect farm family incomes while also protecting the environment.</p></reply>

However, it is experiencing considerable growth at present with the area of land under organic production now at approximately 74,000 hectares, an increase of nearly 50% since 2014.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing the implementation of the National Organic Strategy 2019-2025 which sets out ambitious growth targets for the sector by aligning it closely with the market opportunities. </p>  <p>   The current Programme for Government target is to align the utilisable agricultural area under organic production in Ireland with the EU average of 7.5%. </p>  <p>  The increase in land under organic production in recent years has been driven by the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS). I was pleased, therefore, to reopen the OFS this year with a budget of &euro;4 million which should allow for a further 400 - 500 farmers entering the Scheme. The expected increase in area under organic production as a result of this reopening together with measures under the new CAP will assist in the achievement of these targets.</p></reply>

In this regard, my Department provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations. These supports include funding to carry out applied research through the National Apiculture Programme, grants to national beekeeping associations and grant aid to fund capital investments for beekeepers. My Department has funded a number of studies under the Genetic Research Grant Aid Scheme looking at various aspects of this honeybee species and specifically apis mellifera melliferra. In 2021, funding has been allocated for an innovative queen rearing project. </p>  <p>  In relation to the importation of honeybees into Ireland, this is allowed under regulations governing intra community trade with other EU Member States. The specific health requirements for trading in bees are laid out in Council Directive 92/65/EEC. All imports of bees must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the country of export after a physical inspection of the bees and their packaging has taken place. This is to ensure that imported bees are healthy and do not harbour pathogens or parasites that may be harmful to our native bee stocks. </p></reply>

It is clear that there has been a reduction in engagement from farmers and while there are likely multiple reasons for this, one contributory factor is likely the delays in issuing forestry licences. In order to address the twin objectives of addressing licensing issues and encouraging woodland creation, Project Woodland has been set up under the leadership of Minister-of-State Hackett, who has responsibility for forestry.</p><p>It involves four different Working Groups reporting to the Minister through a Project Manager and a Project Board. The Working Groups are working concurrently, focussing on different areas. The first will concentrate on the backlog, the second on a vision for forestry, the third on devising a fit-for-purpose organisational structure and communication and the fourth on streamlining the licensing process for the future. Through this framework, it is hoped that a renewed confidence in forestry will be fostered, that communication of its benefits will be more widely understood and that, looking to the future, a new vision for forestry in Ireland will be developed.</p><p>In relation to incentives for farmers in future Forestry Programmes, Working Group 2 &ndash; &quot;A Shared National Approach&quot; of Project Woodland - has been tasked with developing a new Forestry Strategy and work in this group has started. This work will inform any new incentives to be introduced in the successor to the current Forestry Programme.  It will be farmer-centred and will be aimed at re-engaging farmers with forestry. </p><p>Forestry has a number of benefits for farmers including on-farm income diversification. Farmers who are interested in receiving information and advice on the available supports provided by my Department are encouraged to contact their Farm Advisor or Teagasc Forestry Advisor.  In addition, details on all Forestry Grant Schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>It remains the case that the afforestation of private lands is the focus of the current Forestry Programme 2014-2020 which commenced in 2015 and has recently been extended to the end of 2022. This programme consists of 11 separate measures to encourage the planting of forests, also with specific supports for farmers. </p><p>Measures included in the programme are voluntary and comprise the main Afforestation Scheme which is delivered through the generous grants and premiums available, across 12 different planting categories, covering 100% of the cost of establishing new forests and also providing annual premium payments which are paid for 15 years.  In addition, farmers can benefit from supports for the establishment of new forest roads, as well as the thinning of a forest plantation. </p><p>Agro forestry is also supported under the current forestry programme which allows for grazing of animals to take place on land that is also planted with trees. The forestry for fibre category provides for the planting of eucalyptus and popular which can be harvested after 15 years, a much shorter rotation than traditional forestry where clearfell could take place between 35 and 40 years from the date of planting. Timber from this type of planting can be used for domestic heating on the farm itself or supplied to local markets to meet a growing demand for firewood.</p><p>It is notable that during the course of the current Forestry Programme so far, this approach has resulted in 2,500 farmers planting a total of 16,000 hectares of forestry on their land.  </p></reply>

Additional resources have been recruited and training, information and guidance has been provided to both Departmental staff and registered foresters and, as a result, we have seen gains in terms of output.  Nonetheless we know we must do more to deliver a better service. </p>  <p>  The introduction of Project Woodland, recently launched by Minister of State Pippa Hackett, with responsibility for forestry, is our strategy for resolving the licensing issues. This new structure aims to ensure that the current backlog is addressed. The Project involves a review and refresh of our processes and procedures and includes outside stakeholder participation to bring an independent perspective. It is a task-driven process, with clear deliverable and milestones.</p>  <p>  Working Group 1 under Project Woodland is specifically tasked with reducing the backlog and then plotting a trajectory to achieve this target.  The recommendation in Ms Jo O'Hara's Implementation Report is that this Group publish a process to achieve these targets, including prioritisation and scheduling and that a monthly dashboard show the outcome of this process against the target trajectory.  Meanwhile, Working Group 4 will address Effective Processes, which will include clearer explanations for the statutory basis for forestry regulation and  the introduction of more efficient and effective processes.  Working Group 4 will also consider piloting an environmental report process with a recommendation for where this should be used, alongside grant support.  I expect there will be cross-cutting issues between these two groups.</p>  <p>  The NIS is used across all development applications in the national and other planning processes and arises as part of compliance, where relevant, with the Appropriate Assessment process under the Habitats Directive.  In cases where an NIS is required and not provided by the applicant, the Department will carry out the ecological assessment.  However, providing an NIS will significantly reduce the time taken to process the application.</p></reply>
