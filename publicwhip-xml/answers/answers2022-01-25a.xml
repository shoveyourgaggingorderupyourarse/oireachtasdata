This will support the delivery of approximately 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 Cost Rental homes to 2030.</p>  <p>  I set out the legislative framework for Cost Rental in the Affordable Housing Act last year. It is a long-term rental model, in which tenants only pay the cost of providing, managing and maintaining their homes. We are committed to growing this sector, and in 2022 over 700 Cost Rental homes will be completed and tenanted via Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) funded by my Department. Together with homes that will delivered by the LDA under Project Tosaigh, this will see approximately 1,500 Cost Rental homes provided for this year.</p>  <p>  In the applications that AHBs have received for the homes made available under Cost Rental so far, they have noted a strong demand for one and two-bed homes. However, there is a willingness to facilitate demand for a range of unit sizes in order to meet this affordability crisis. In fact, three and four-bedroom Cost Rental homes have made up approximately 24% of the 821 homes approved under CREL to date.</p>  <p>  My Department are also supporting the delivery of affordable purchase and Cost Rental homes through Local Authorities via the Affordable Housing Fund. Of the homes approved in principle to date, 38% are either three or four-bedroom homes, which further demonstrates our commitment to a broad range of unit types to meet the needs of different households across the country.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside the draft regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This is expected to commence shortly. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution before they can be made and the SEA process concluded.  The process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions is expected to be completed in Q2 2022. </p></reply>

These measures are being delivered via local authorities and the Land Development Agency and a new national First Home scheme.   </p>  <p>  The Local Authority led affordable purchase dwelling arrangements will support buyers in purchasing local authority delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the cost of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. Regulations to set out the detailed criteria are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks. The first affordable purchase homes delivered through this scheme are anticipated to be made available next month in Boherboy, Cork City.</p>  <p>  The First Home affordable purchase scheme will operate for the period 2022 to 2026 utilising funding of c. &euro;400m. It will support first-time buyers on moderate incomes to buy a new-build home in private developments. A newly-established First Home Designated Activity Company to operate this scheme was incorporated in December. Significant work is continuing on the detailed design and parameters of the scheme, and full details will be confirmed upon completion of this work. It is anticipated that initial activity on key areas of work, including public communications, will begin in Q1, and in advance of First Home&rsquo;s first receipt of applications and deployment of equity support, scheduled for Q2 this year.</p></reply>

In June 2021 following a comprehensive international open market campaign, named a consortium of Ronan Group Real Estate, Oaktree Capital Management, and Lioncor Developments (&ldquo;the Consortium&rdquo;) acquired a controlling 80% shareholding in the company which owns the glass bottle site for &euro;200m. NAMA maintains a 20% minority interest. The development of the site will be undertaken by the Consortium. </p>  <p>  I am advised that in July 2021, a planning application was submitted to Dublin City Council (DCC) for Phase 1 to construct 600 apartments, including 90 affordable and 62 social homes. DCC issued a decision in September 2021, requiring the applicant to revert with further information on matters outstanding. As this site is progressed, my Department is coordinating internally to work with DCC, and the developers to progress this much needed housing. </p>  <p>  The Emmet Road (formerly St Michael&rsquo;s Estate) project is being undertaken by DCC. Current plans propose 484 homes, 375 being Cost Rental and 109 social homes. I met with residents of the area in December 2021. This will be an important site in the development of a long-term model for the large-scale provision of Cost Rental homes.</p>  <p>  Approval in principle for &euro;18.75 million in Departmental funding for the Cost Rental homes has been granted for this project. The European Investment Bank has also confirmed support in principle.  My Department is also committed to providing funding support for the social housing on this site and to working with all parties to progress both of these developments.</p></reply>

Indeed I met with this group at one of its first meetings in December 2020. This group, which included 1916 Relatives, street traders and Oireachtas members last year presented its final report to Minister O&rsquo;Brien and myself, putting forward a number of important recommendations on how the street and its market could be rejuvenated and how the national monument buildings at Nos. 14 &ndash; 17 Moore St. could be presented to the public as a 1916 Commemorative Centre.   </p>  <p>  As Minister, I am precluded from commenting on a live planning case under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 so am unable to meet with any groups to discuss a planning application while a case is live.  </p>  <p>  I also receive numerous types of requests to attend and officiate at events, to visit sites, and to meet with individuals or groups. Unfortunately due to time pressure I am unable to agree to everything presented to me. I did receive some requests for meetings from parties interested in the development plans referred to, however I must reiterate that many of those requesters were represented on the MSAG with whom I met.</p></reply>

This will ensure a dedicated focus on tackling vacancy and dereliction with a view to increasing the opportunities for residential development.

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.</p><p>The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs.</p><p>Indications of increased construction activity are becoming evident which will help increase the supply and availability of housing.  </p><p>There is a strong supply pipeline, with latest Commencement Notices data showing a total number of 30,724 residential dwellings commenced in 2021. </p><p>This is a 42% increase when compared to the number of residential dwellings commenced in 2020 (21,686), a 17% increase when compared to in 2019 (26,237), and a 37% increase when compared to 2018 (22,467). The 2021 total is almost equal to the combined totals for 2016 and 2017 (30,816).</p><p>Of the 30,724 new dwellings commenced in 2021, 82.7% of these were scheme developments (25,409) and 17.3% were single houses (5,315). </p><p>With regard to the number of homes built, in the year to Quarter 3 2021, almost 21,000 new dwellings were completed. This represents a 6.8% year-on-year increase. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) will publish its Q4 2021 New Dwelling Completions data in the coming days.</p><p>Completions for 2022 and 2023 are projected to exceed the <i>Housing for All</i>targets of 24,600 and 29,000 respectively. The Central Bank forecasts that some 27,000 and 31,000 homes will be completed in 2022 and 2023 respectively.</p><p>The most recent CSO figures on planning permissions also show a strong pipeline, with 39,077 units (apartments/flats and houses) granted planning permission in the 12 months to end Q3 2021.</p><p>Increasing the supply of housing as set out in <i>Housing for All</i>is the top priority for me and the Government and we have made a good start on our path towards this goal.  However, I acknowledge that we are coming from a low base of supply and that it will take some time before the full benefits of the strategy are tangible to our citizens. </p><p>The housing challenge remains immense, and continues to be affected by ongoing challenges including COVID-19 related delays, supply chain difficulties and inflationary pressure. The cost of housing &ndash; for those buying or renting - will continue to be a challenge in the short-term and, while we do not underestimate the difficulties this is causing for our citizens, I am confident that the delivery of <i>Housing for All</i>will create a sustainable housing system into the future.</p></reply>

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.</p><p>The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs</p><p><i>Housing for All</i>recognises that external sources of finance will be needed to bridge the gap between the overall funding requirement to build an average of 33,000 homes each year, and that provided via direct Exchequer funding, State borrowing, Home Building Finance Ireland and the domestic banking sector. Private finance and institutional investment has a role to play in supporting new supply, particularly in high density apartments that would otherwise not be built and it is important to recognise the positive effects that institutional investment can have in terms of increasing the supply of housing; bringing diversity of supply with experienced large scale management practices; and increased choice for tenants, which is important for the market and for renters. </p><p>It is essential that we achieve the balance between addressing the issue of multiple purchases by institutional investors, whilst at the same time ensuring that the supply of financing to the market is not undermined, particularly for the construction of new developments.</p><p>In this regard, the Government absolutely recognises the need for protections to prevent investment moving into other areas where viability and demand are not issues and that is why as a Government we moved quickly in May 2021 to introduce the stamp duty increase and to provide guidance to planning authorities. </p><p>Furthermore, in December 2021, legislation was enacted as part of the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Act 2021 that sets out the requirement for a housing strategy to take into account the existing need and the likely future need for housing, in particular houses and duplexes, for purchase by intending owner occupiers.</p><p>To address the rent affordability challenges, building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for December 2021 shows HICP inflation of 5.7% p.a.) the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 provides, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs, where the inflation rate is higher. In effect, this will mean that rents in RPZs may only increase by a maximum of 2% per annum pro rata during times of higher inflation. </p><p>In all cases, section 19(1) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds market rent.</p><p>The RTB Rent Index is published quarterly and reveals the actual rents being paid for rented properties, as distinct from the asking rents which feature in other rent reports. It is compiled in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). It is based on actual rents paid on private tenancies registered with the RTB in the quarter, which is made up of homes new to the rental sector, new tenancies in existing housing stock and renewals of existing tenancies.  Rent Index publications from 2007 to Q3 2021 can be found on www.rtb.ie/data-hub/rent-index </p><p>In the <i>Housing for All</i>plan, both the State and the private market have an integral role to play in increasing the delivery of new homes. The measures brought in last year and the actions laid out in <i>Housing for All</i>will increase the supply of homes available for purchase and rent across the country.</p></reply>

This funding was introduced in 2014 to tackle long term vacancy and is now increasingly targeted to support authority's to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock. </p><p>In relation to Galway City and County Council, the local authorities combined have received over &euro;7.5 million in funding from 2014 to 2021, supporting the return of 623 properties to use. </p><p>There has been extensive funding provided particularly over the last two years under the Voids programme which not only catered for standard relets but also for vacant properties requiring more extensive works prior to relet. It is up to each local authority to submit a programme of works based on their individual allocation or targets. </p><p>In 2020, &euro;56.4m exchequer funding was provided to bring a total of 3,607 vacant homes back into productive use within the social housing stock. This represents the highest ever yearly spend and the highest number of homes to be refurbished under the voids programme. Within this programme local authorities had the opportunity to remediate long term vacant properties (houses vacant over 12 months) the funding for which was uncapped. Again in 2021, the Voids programme catered for a non-standard refurbishment option which allowed local authorities claim an average of &euro;50,000 funding in this category (no vacancy limit). Full details in relation to output under the 2021 programme will be published presently.</p><p>Local authorities will always have a level of vacancy in their housing stock. This will fluctuate over time as tenancy surrender and re-letting of stock is an ongoing process. The list below outlines reasons for vacancy but this is not an exhaustive list. </p><p>- For demolition and major regeneration</p><p>- Not for letting &ndash; earmarked for sale</p><p>- Dispute/legal issues holding up tenancy</p><p>- 2nd hand acquisition pending refurbishment</p><p>- Repaired and awaiting letting</p><p>- New build turnkey awaiting letting</p><p>- Offered and not accepted.</p><p>It is important to note that my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes are aligned with this approach. </p></reply>

National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, NPO 19 of the NPF aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, and other weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining. NPO 19 is aligned with the established planning approach as per the 2005 Rural Housing Guidelines, whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part-time) need may be applied by planning authorities in certain rural areas under urban influence in order to prevent urban sprawl.</p>  <p>  Under the current Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing (2005), planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing.  </p>  <p>  In considering the framework for policy within a development plan, matters such as the level of pressure for development in a county, the promotion of sustainable development patterns, landscape protection, Strategic Environmental Assessment of the impact of policy and National and Regional development objectives must be taken into account.  </p>  <p>  Adoption of a plan is a reserved function of the relevant local authority, undertaken by the elected members and advised by the Chief Executive. Assessment of planning applications is also a matter for the local authority, taking into account the objectives of the adopted development plan in addition to national policy and section 28 Ministerial Guidelines.  Each application must be assessed on its own merits, based on the documentation submitted, analysis of the particular site circumstances and compliance with adopted policy.  </p>  <p>  Comparison of grants of planning permission for rural housing in various local authorities does not reflect the particular issues and locational circumstances which have informed the policy framework of a local authority. These could include a location proximate to a large city and the significant level of urban-generated rural housing demand as a result, landscape sensitivity to development, the availability of land within a small local authority for rural and urban development needs and designation of significant land areas for Natura 2000 sites or other environmental sensitivities.  </p>  <p>  Updated section 28 guidelines on Rural Housing are currently being drafted by my Department to ensure consistency with new requirements and legislation at national and EU level introduced in respect of areas related to rural housing such as environmental protection, the Gaeltacht and climate action. The new guidelines, being prepared in draft in Q1 of this year, will ensure a more consistent approach between local authorities and alignment with NPF objectives. In the meantime, NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to prepare and adopt development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas. </p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ). For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a Local Electoral Area (LEA) within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a RPZ.</p><p>The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act for designation as an RPZ are as follows: </p><p>- the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal, and the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, is &ndash; </p><p>- in the case of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow or an LEA in any one of those counties, above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the 4 Dublin Local Authority areas, or </p><p>- in the case of any LEA outside of the Greater Dublin Area (i.e. Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow), above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the Greater Dublin Area. </p><p>Each RTB quarterly Rent Index Report includes a summary table of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfills the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases. </p><p>The RTB Rent Index measures rent increases in LEAs using the 2019 boundaries for these LEAs and there is no specific measure to calculate rental increases broken down to any lower level (i.e. part of an LEA). </p><p>The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if any LEA (in its entirety) in Galway or Roscommon meets the designation criteria, it will be designated as a RPZ. </p><p>The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of RPZs until the end of 2024. The Act provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum 2 year period at a time.</p><p>The Act also introduced measures  to better protect tenants with affordability by  prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).</p><p>To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for December 2021 shows HICP inflation of 5.7% p.a.), the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 provides, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs, where the inflation rate is higher.

It is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave. The full conditions for eligibility under the Scheme are available on the Pyrite Board&rsquo;s website at www.pyriteboard.ie.  Up to the end of 2021, 3063 applications have been received under the Scheme and 2530 dwellings have been included. Of the dwellings included, the works in respect of 2292 are complete with the rest at various stages of progress.  A budget of &euro;20 million has been provided for in 2022, with an expectation that approximately 270 homes will be remediated. </p><p>Separately, I have established a working group to examine defects in housing which has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August), in addition to subgroup meetings. The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.  </p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect,</p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected,</p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>- Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>6. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>7. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>8. Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group is engaging with a wide range of interested parties. The first round of stakeholder consultation commenced in July 2021, with more detailed follow up and additional stakeholder consultations ongoing at present. In addition, preparations are being made to launch an online survey, in the next couple of weeks, seeking the views of homeowners, landlords, Directors of Owners&rsquo; Management Companies and Property Management Agents etc.</p><p>I am satisfied that the group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter and I look forward to a report later this year following completion of their deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p><p>Finally, in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade, a three pronged Building Control Reform Agenda has been developed which focuses on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance with Building Regulations. The three elements include;</p><p>1. Reform of the Building Control process;</p><p>2. Building Control Management Project and establishment of a National Building Control Office; and</p><p>3. The publication earlier this month of  the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2021. The legislation will put the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing and aims to benefit consumers and the general public by giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator. </p><p>I thank the Deputy for introducing the Defective Dwellings Bill 2021 which I will continue to consider in the context of the ongoing implementation of the Building Control Reform Agenda and the upcoming report of the Working Group examining defects in housing. </p></reply>

This is in conjunction with the policy framework as to how the Cost Rental sector will operate in Ireland, as set out in the Affordable Housing Act 2021.</p>  <p>  Over the period to 2030, it is intended that approximately 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered. They will be provided by AHBs supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan funding (CREL), by Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund and by the LDA on their portfolio of sites or through Project Tosaigh.  </p>  <p>  Cost Rental delivery will be informed by National Planning Framework priorities. It will be focused, at least initially, on densely populated urban areas where rental affordability pressures are particularly acute and where State resources can have the biggest impact. It is important that the State targets its affordability measures towards the parts of the country that are experiencing the most extreme affordability challenges. This is why my Department requested Housing Delivery Action Plans from each Local Authority before the end of December 2021 and will use the data submitted to target the most affected areas.</p>  <p>  The implementation of initial Cost Rental projects is being supported by the CREL scheme, under which Government provides loans to AHBs to finance up to 30% of the capital costs for new cost rental homes, while the Housing Finance Agency is offering AHBs very competitive commercial debt funding to cover the remaining capital costs. &euro;70 million was allocated to CREL in Budget 2022. </p>  <p>  A total of 390 Cost Rental homes were approved under the first tranche of CREL funding in early 2021. These new homes are located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area and Cork, with cost-covering rents projected at a minimum of 25% less than comparable open market prices.</p>  <p>  The first 25 Cost Rental homes to be designated in Ireland were completed by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan and the first tenants moved into their new homes at Taylor Hill in August 2021. The cost-covering rents for these homes are approximately 40% below comparable open-market prices in the area, ranging from &euro;935 per month for a two-bed terraced house to &euro;1,150 for a four-bed detached house.</p>  <p>  Another 40 Cost Rental homes have recently been completed at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip, County Kildare, where all tenants have moved into their new homes. The cost-covering rents for these CREL-funded homes range from &euro;900 per month for the two-bed homes to &euro;1,250 per month for the three-bed homes, which are approximately 42% below market rent.</p>  <p>  Overall, AHBs are targeted to provide some 700 homes through CREL in 2022 of a total target of 1,500 Cost Rental homes to be provided this year. In addition, another 50 two-bedroom Cost Rental apartments are in the final stages of completion at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, by the Respond and Tuath AHBs, alongside 105 social housing units. This project is the result of an innovative collaboration between the two AHBs and of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The 50 purpose-built Cost Rental apartments are due to be tenanted over the next few weeks.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council is also progressing 375 Cost Rental homes on a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (formerly St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate) and the LDA is collaborating with D&uacute;n-Laoghaire Rathdown County Council to deliver over 300 cost rental homes on a site at Shanganagh, Shankill.</p></reply>

This funding was introduced in 2014 to tackle long term vacancy and is now increasingly targeted to support authority's to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock. </p><p>In the period 2014 &ndash; 2021, Exchequer funding has been provided in excess of &euro;260 million to remediate 18,527 vacant properties. There has been extensive funding provided over the last two years under the Voids programme which not only catered for standard relets but also for vacant properties requiring more extensive works prior to relet. This resulted in over 6,000 vacant homes being remediated in the period 2020-2021 at a cost of almost &euro;90 million.</p><p>My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in this area. As in previous years, all local authorities will be asked to make a funding application under the 2022 programme in respect of their vacant stock which will receive due consideration and funding allocations will issue to all local authorities in due course. It is up to each local authority to complete their programme of works based on their individual allocation and targets.</p><p>It should also be noted that local authorities will always have a level of vacancy in their housing stock. This will fluctuate over time as the tenancy surrender and re-letting of stock is an ongoing process. The below refers to the reasons for vacancy but this is not an exhaustive list.</p><p>- For demolition and major regeneration</p><p>- Not for letting &ndash; earmarked for sale</p><p>- Dispute/legal issues holding up tenancy</p><p>- 2nd hand acquisition pending refurbishment</p><p>- Repaired and awaiting letting</p><p>- New build turnkey awaiting letting</p><p>- Offered and not accepted.</p><p>Finally, my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes are aligned with this approach.</p></reply>

A number of measures are set out under the plan to support this goal. </p><p>A new Local Authority Home Loan, was launched in early January and is available nationwide, for those on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. </p><p>The key improvement of the new revised home loan is an increase to the income ceiling for single applicants by &euro;15,000 to &euro;65,000 where the house price limit under the scheme is &euro;320,000 (i.e. Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath or Wicklow). In addition, a 0.25% interest rate reduction has been applied. These changes will have a significant impact on the numbers of potential applicants and has improved the affordability of the loan itself.</p><p>The Help to Buy incentive for first time buyers has been extended to the end of this year. An owner-occupier guarantee which requires Local Authorities to ensure home ownership as a tenure type is provided for and estimated in their Housing Strategies has also been introduced.</p><p><i>Housing for All</i>commits to the introduction of two new affordable purchase schemes. The first will see the delivery of affordable homes by local authorities. The second will see the introduction of a 'First Home' affordable purchase shared equity scheme for homes in private developments. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p><p>The delivery of Cost Rental homes is a key affordability measure under Housing for All, with State-backed rents that are in the order of 25% below what they would be on the private market. 65 cost rental homes have been tenanted to date, in developments in Balbriggan and Leixlip, and a further 1,580 cost rental homes are targeted for delivery in 2022.</p><p>To support local authorities in the delivery of affordable homes, the Affordable Housing Fund has replaced the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The Fund has been open for applications from 1 September 2021. My Department has actively engaged with the Local Authorities to support and encourage them to develop and submit proposals. The homes that Local Authorities deliver under the Affordable Housing Fund will be sold at least 15% below open market value in respect of Affordable Purchase homes and in the order of 25% below open market value prices in respect of Cost Rental homes. </p><p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) has a key role in the delivery of affordable homes, including through &ldquo;Project Tosaigh&rdquo; aimed at accelerating the delivery of up to 5,000 homes. The first delivery stream of this LDA initiative to bring privately developed units to market affordably and quickly was launched on 12 November 2021. The LDA issued a call for Expressions of Interest for advance purchase agreements to developers, with a target scheme scale in excess of 150 units per development, in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The Expressions of Interest submitted are currently being assessed by the LDA with their priority focus and engagement being on schemes with potential delivery in 2022 and 2023. </p><p>Stream 2 of Project Tosaigh will be launched in the coming months and will target more comprehensive developer partnerships (rather than specific developments) to deliver a stable flow of affordable homes over a 3 to 4 year period. It is intended that the homes, upon acquisition, will be primarily owned and managed by the LDA for the provision of cost rental accommodation and/or sold as affordable homes. These homes will be targeted at those middle-income households that do not qualify for social housing, but struggle to afford open market housing, i.e. household incomes of broadly &euro;45,000 to &euro;80,000 per annum</p><p>In addition, the LDA has specific statutory responsibility to deliver affordable housing, primarily on State land. Housing for All identifies 20 State land sites that will be transferred to the LDA which have the potential to provide 15,000 homes. Initial discussions are underway on the transfer of each of the sites identified in Housing for All, with work further progressed on 14 additional sites identified prior to the publication of Housing for All. A number of these 14 sites have received planning permission or will submit a planning permission application in 2022.</p><p>A key action under Housing for All provides that local authorities were required to prepare a Housing Delivery Action Plan, setting out details of social and affordable housing delivery over the next five years. All local authorities submitted their plan to me in December and my Department is engaging with local authorities on these plans, in particular their alignment with the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. The Plans will be published in Quarter 2 of 2022. Increased capacity of the public service to deliver, along with the streamlining of approval processes in relation to housing delivery are key priorities under Housing for All. Over 200 additional posts have been sanctioned and are in the process of being filled across Local Authority housing delivery teams in order to deliver on the scale of Housing for All&rsquo;s ambition.</p><p>With regard to construction more generally, and the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade, indications of increased activity are becoming evident. The number of homes delivered in the year to end-Q3 2021 was 20,903, while the number of commencements in 2021 was 30,724, reflecting a greater than 3-fold increase in commencements since 2015 and a steady upward trend in the number of commencements. The most recent CSO figures on planning permissions also show a strong pipeline, with 39,077 units (apartments/flats and houses) granted planning permission in the 12 months to end Q3 2021. This pipeline data gives confidence that we are on a strong upward trajectory in the delivery of our housing supply targets.  </p></reply>

As such, they are not covered by the statutory framework for employees in relation to maternity leave. </p>  <p>  I recognise that this is not an acceptable situation and is also an obstacle to the participation of women in local government. It is an issue I am determined to address as a matter of urgency, in a progressive and comprehensive manner. The role of the councillor must be one that is accessible, manageable and sustainable for all, thus helping to ensure that councillors are more fully representative of the constituents they serve. </p>  <p>  As matters currently stand, it is only under the provisions of Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 that councillors may be absent from the role for maternity purposes. Under Section 18, a councillor shall be deemed to have automatically resigned from membership of a local authority if he or she is absent from meetings for a continuous period of 6 consecutive months. Where the absence is due to illness or &ldquo;in good faith for another reason&rdquo;, then the period of absence may be extended first to 12 months and then to up to 18 months by resolution of the Council. </p>  <p>  A councillor who is absent for 6 months will continue to receive the full amount of his or her Representational Payment. Thereafter this payment is reduced by 50% for absences of 6 to 12 months duration. A councillor who is absent for more than 12 months will not receive any further payments regardless of the reason for the absence. </p>  <p>  With effect from January 2017, the Social Welfare Acts were amended so that councillors gained access to the same benefits as self-employed contributors. Accordingly, councillors are now reckonable for the purposes of accessing Class S benefits, including Maternity Benefit. </p>  <p>  On 29 March 2021, I hosted the first meeting of a working group of women councillors established to examine all maternity-related matters, including wider supports other than maternity leave. This group, which is a representative and cross political party group of women councillors, met a number of times in 2021. Their extensive deliberations have given my officials and I greater understanding of the needs of women councillors and have been important in the development of a policy approach.  </p>  <p>  My Department has since engaged extensively with the Office of the Attorney General on legal questions arising. My officials are also engaging in a positive manner with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in relation to bringing councillors under the maternity protection legislative framework.   </p>  <p>  Following this work, it is my intention to bring forward as early as feasible this year a package of maternity-related measures for councillors, which will include proposals for legislative change. </p></reply>

These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  This Act, supported by the unprecedented levels of funding committed to in the Housing for All strategy, averaging over &euro;4 billion annually, will underpin the delivery of affordable housing targets. Specifically, 54,000 affordable homes will be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the first affordable purchase homes under the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will be made available in Cork in February. Cork City Council indicated the prices to be &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling. This will be followed by a Fingal County Council supported affordable purchase development (Dun Emer). Fingal County Council have indicated these will cost &euro;166,000 for a 2-bed apartment and between &euro;206,000 and &euro;258,000 for 3-bed dwellings.</p>  <p>  Separately, as part of Housing for All, additional funding of &euro;1bn was committed to the Land Development Agency in order for it to deliver on its pipeline of housing. This includes Project Tosaigh under which the LDA will enter into forward purchase arrangements to kick-start stalled private developments and increase the supply of affordable housing. The LDA initiated a call on 12 November 2021 targeting a scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development and is currently assessing the proposals received.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the Housing Delivery Coordination Office (within the LGMA) issued a call to secure additional affordable homes across 14 local authorities with the most acute affordability constraint. This call is also focused on stalled private developments but targets smaller scale developments than the LDA initiative.</p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act provided for the establishment of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland. Despite the impacts of Covid-19, 65 Cost Rental homes were tenanted in 2021 (25 in Balbriggan Co, Dublin, and 40 in Leixlip Co. Kildare). Over 700 Cost Rental homes will be delivered by Approved Housing Bodies in 2022, with more to be delivered by the LDA.</p>  <p>  The First Home shared equity scheme, under Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing newly constructed homes on the private market. This scheme will be available at a national level and will incorporate regional price caps based on median house price sales. A Designated Activity Company to operate this scheme was incorporated last December. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications in Q2 of this year. </p>  <p>  This multi-faceted approach will improve affordability for all families or individuals across society wishing to secure a home.</p></reply>

It extended the delivery of Housing First nationally and included an overall target of 663 tenancies for the period 2018-2021.</p><p>Data on the number of Housing First tenancies created are published every three months as part of my Department's Homeless Quarterly Progress Reports. The most recent report from the end of September 2021 shows that a total of 695 tenancies were created since the launch of the first National Implementation Plan in 2018, exceeding the targets set.</p><p><i>Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland </i>committed to the further expansion of Housing First. A new National Implementation Plan, which provides for a further 1,319 tenancies covering the period 2022-2026, was published in December 2021. The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of my Department, the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the criminal justice sector (the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service) and Local Authorities, in conjunction with NGO partners. Each partner is committing the necessary resources and supports to implement the programme.</p><p>A new National Directorate for the Housing First programme is being put in place and will be based in The Housing Agency. It will manage programme delivery. Governance and oversight is effected through a National Implementation Group which consists of representatives from the partners to the programme.</p></reply>

They are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p>  <p>  The Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access. Part M aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment. While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, my Department established a Working Group specifically to examine the provision for a changing places toilet in certain buildings. A changing places toilet offers larger supported facilities that address the needs of people for whom current accessible sanitary accommodation is inadequate. These facilities enable people with complex care needs to take part in everyday activities such as travel, shopping, family days out or attending a sporting event.</p>  <p>  The plenary Working Group has met six times to date, in addition to a number of sub-group meetings.  Draft documentation, which includes draft Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations, draft Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use and a Regulatory Impact Analysis, is currently being finalised to support a  public consultation on the matter shortly.  </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that Part 3 of the Disability Act 2005 places an obligation on public bodies to make their buildings and services accessible.  Section 25 states that 'a public body shall ensure that its public buildings are as far as practicable, accessible to persons with disabilities' and requires public bodies to apply Part M retrospectively to the public areas of public buildings. Section 25 states that where Part M is amended, public buildings shall be brought into compliance with any amendments not later than ten years after the commencement of that amendment.</p></reply>

Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and ensure that such applications are dealt with within timeframes that are significantly shorter that the statutory maximum. Different timescales may apply where the local authority requires additional information from the applicant within the relevant period, as defined in the Regulations, thus leading to possible extensions to the 12 week deadline in terms of completing the application process.</p>  <p>  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenges faced throughout the period of the Covid emergency measures, local authorities and the HAP Shared Service Centre (HAP SSC) have continued to provide a critical service to all HAP customers. </p>  <p>  Measures that were required to be taken in the context of Covid-19 did, however, have an impact on processing times for HAP applications. </p>  <p>  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP SSC. If there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord may be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority. The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay.</p>  <p>  My Department and the local authorities are aware of the importance of minimising HAP processing times and the critical need to keep this under review at a local level, in order to ensure times are minimised to the greatest extent possible. This has been communicated clearly to the County and City Management Association (CCMA), and my Department is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to do so over the coming months.</p></reply>

The Expert Review report, which is intended to improve the effectiveness of the arrangements for providing accommodation for members of the Traveller community, has 32 recommendations across 4 categories which are aimed at:  </p>  <p>  1. Addressing research deficiencies, including how information is gathered and used;</p>  <p>  2. Removing any potential delays and obstacles in the planning system in terms of delivery;</p>  <p>  3.

For example, internal liaison is ongoing with Homelessness Unit developing insights on Traveller homelessness. The Programme Board recently agreed to report progress on implementation of the recommendations on my Department's website. It is expected that this information will be available shortly. </p>  <p>  I, and my Department, will continue our collaborative work with local authorities to support the consistent delivery of accommodation for Travellers and to address the needs of all those experiencing homelessness, including Travellers.</p></reply>

Significant work has been undertaken on the noise elements and the two Departments recently met to discuss new developments in this regard including consideration of the impact of the revised 2030 target to generate up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources and the need to ensure that proposals regarding the measurement and assessment of noise from wind turbines are fit for purpose.

The scheme will support first-time buyers on moderate incomes to buy a new-build home, subject to price ceilings reflective of median prices. </p><p>Budget 2022 allocated &euro;44 million to my Department for First Home. The banking sector has confirmed it is committed to working with the State to develop and deliver this scheme, and has agreed in principle to match this State funding in order to increase the pool of funding available to potential new homeowners. Subject to the necessary approvals by all parties, it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will operate for the period 2022 to 2026, utilising overall funding of c. &euro;400m and providing support to c. 8,000 households to purchase homes. </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) addressed the First Home scheme in its Financial Stability Review II of 2021, published 25 November 2021, and noted that the Scheme would provide an equity rather than a loan product and as such would mitigate the risk of borrower over-indebtedness. In light of these conclusions, the CBI amended the Mortgage Measures Regulations in order to make explicit that regulated mortgage lenders, including the pillar retail banks, may collaborate with the Government in the First Home scheme. This amendment was made, by the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Housing Loan Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations 2021, on the 7 December 2021. </p><p>It is intended that the scheme will be operated by a newly-established &lsquo;First Home Scheme Ireland&rsquo; Designated Activity Company which was incorporated in December last. Significant work is continuing on the detailed design and parameters of the scheme, and full scheme details will be confirmed upon completion of this work. It is anticipated that initial activity on key areas of work, including public communications, will be conducted in Q1 of this year, in advance of First Home&rsquo;s first receipt of applications and deployment of equity support, scheduled for Q2. </p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.</p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. Project scoping feedback has been received from interested parties through the draft Request for Tender process and has been considered by my Department in the development of the final Request for Tender documentation. My Department intends to publish the call for tender shortly. </p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department has advanced interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside a draft of the interim regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence shortly. A copy of the draft interim regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before finalisation of the draft interim regulation. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is expected to be completed in Q2 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner. </p></reply>

Whether it is starting a business or growing a business there is something suitable for anyone exploring self-employment as an option. </p>  <p>  In particular, I would encourage the person to enquire about the Start Your Own Business Programme. The objective is to assist clients in assessing their business idea, its viability and helps them decide if they should proceed or take a step back. The programme covers topics such as Starting up / getting started, identifying, understanding, and researching your target market, developing your business plan amongst other vital areas of interest to a new business. </p>  <p>  I would also suggest seeking the advice of a LEO Business Mentor; the Mentor programme is open to both new and existing businesses located within the Local Enterprise Office region and is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance. The mentor contributes independent, informed observation and advice to aid decision making. </p>  <p>  Mentors can also advise on finance options available to entrepreneurs and can assist with applications and referrals to Micro-Finance Ireland, which provides vital support to eligible microenterprises by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders and who do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders. It offers loan funding, including Start-up Loans, from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000. As of December 2021, Microfinance Ireland has approved 4,177 loans worth &euro;70 million since establishments in 2012, with 9% of these loans approved to the construction sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-25a.273.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012500063#WRE04900"><p>Ireland operates a managed employment permits system maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market.  The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy.  However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.</p><p>The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review. </p><p>Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment.  Feedback received from enterprise across the board has been universally positive.  In fact, Ireland was one of the few countries that has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis. </p><p>From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permit applications are expedited with immediate effect. </p><p>My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year.  Applications for Employment Permits increased significantly over the course of 2021, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  My Department issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 by mid January 2022, but it is now stabilising.</p><p>In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.</p><p>Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July 2021 Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications. </p><p>An Action Plan has been developed and is being implemented to tackle the backlog, with both human resource interventions and systemic changes.  The staffing actions being taken include: </p><p>- Recruitment of additional permanent and temporary staff.  This is an increase of 69% on our permanent capacity and 125% to include temporary staff to deal with the backlog in applications. </p><p>- Temporary reassignment of staff from other areas of the Department with relevant skills. </p><p>- Increased overtime arrangements.</p><p>As the Plan is implemented and begins to take effect, we expect to see improvements in the backlog from end-January, with thebacklog considerably reduced by the end of Q1 and substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.</p><p>In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.  My Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.  A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.  This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period. </p><p>The Department provides regular updates on its website in relation to processing times and engages directly with key stakeholders including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups and individual companies, as required, including regarding sectoral labour requirements. </p><p>The Management Board of my Department is overseeing the implementation of the Action Plan and its impact on the backlog and waiting times.</p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  Since the start of the scheme, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades.  The average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household in 2021 was &euro;17,100, an increase of approximately &euro;1,000 per home since 2020. </p>  <p>The average wait times were impacted by the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in place for periods during 2020 and 2021 when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines. Wait times have also been impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead in time for materials. The SEAI has advised me that wait times may vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application.  For instance, once the survey is completed and works are allocated to a contractor, the time to complete works is dependent on a number of factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials, weather and in recent years COVID-19 public health restrictions. </p>  <p>There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme, a reduction of approximately 300 since December 2020. This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.</p>  <p>SEAI data indicates that for homes completed to date in 2021, the average time from application to completion was approximately 26 months.  For the same period, the average time for a surveyor to be allocated was approximately 18 months, a reduction of five months since December 2020.</p>  <p>Budget 2022 has allocated &euro;202 million for residential and community retrofit this year. Over half of this (&euro;109 million) will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households in the Warmer Homes Scheme. In addition, delivery capacity in the supply chain has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. I have also secured additional resources to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. SEAI received  additional funding in Budget 2021 which delivered an increase of 30 staff across the organisation and Budget 2022 is providing funding for a further 30 staff this year.  Every effort is being made to maximise output since construction activity in the residential sector recommenced in mid-April 2021.</p></reply>

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan with over 290,000 premises surveyed or with survey underway and over 154,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 11 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon and Tipperary and over 54,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties, as of 14 January. There are over 97,000 premises in County Kildare of which over 83,000 are in the commercial area and over 14,000 are within the NBP Intervention Area. </p>  <p>  I am advised by NBI that, over 7,000 premises in County Kildare have been surveyed with over 1,200 premises available for order or pre order. Surveying is complete in the Deployment Area of Donadea. Surveying is also complete in the Curragh Camp Deployment Area which includes premises located in the Walterstown and Ellistown Intervention Areas, ensuring that these  premises  will be delivered with high speed broadband under the NBP. Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 14 January, 453 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed in County Kildare at Crookstown Further Education and Training and Community Centre, Bigstone Community Hall, and Lullymore Heritage Park. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Rathmore National School, and Saint David's National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan 2021 already includes actions relating to green hydrogen in the electricity, enterprise and transport sectors. It also sets out how green hydrogen could address some of the challenges faced by the energy sector, such as providing a back-up for intermittent renewables. A key target set out in the Climate Action Plan is to carry out a work programme to identify a route to deliver one to three terra-watt hours of zero emissions gas (including green hydrogen) by 2030. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan is a living document and will be updated on an annual basis to reflect ongoing developments and targets achieved. My Department continues to work with relevant Departments, agencies and stakeholders to carry out research and develop policies to support the uptake of green hydrogen. I expect a strategy focussing on the development of green hydrogen to be included in Climate Action Plan 2022. A large public consultation process was undertaken as part of the development of the Climate Action Plan 2021 and, going forward, there will be on-going dialogue with citizens and stakeholders, including public consultation.</p></reply>

This policy statement sets out that the development of new conventional generation is a national priority and should be permitted and supported in order to ensure security of electricity supply and support the growth of renewable electricity generation. This Policy Statement on Security of Electricity Supply sets out a number of updates to national policy in the context of the Programme for Government commitments relevant to the electricity sector, planning authorities and developers. In relation to LNG, this policy statement does not change what was set out in the Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas published in May 2021. In particular, I would note where it sets out that &ldquo;<i>pending the outcome of the review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems, it would not be appropriate for the development of any LNG terminals in Ireland to be permitted or proceeded with</i>&rdquo;. While a project involving an LNG terminal may also include gas-fired generation, it is still an LNG terminal and so it would not be appropriate for the project to be permitted or proceeded with pending the outcome of the review. </p><p>The review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems is expected to complete in mid-2022, following which the results will be brought to Government. </p><p>The clarification set out above has been provided to An Bord Plean&aacute;la via the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage.</p></reply>

In 2021, SEAI and nine local authorities co-funded &euro;700,000 in support to 44 communities to undertake energy master plans. These plans allow a community to assess and understand it&rsquo;s current and future energy needs (in electricity, heat and transport) in order for the community to make informed decisions and prioritise actions. It helps communities to identify opportunities so they can become more energy efficient, use renewable energy where possible, and use smart energy technology if appropriate.   </p>  <p>  SECs will continue to be supported by Government to expand their roles as &lsquo;activators&rsquo; in their community. There are currently over 580 SECs in the SEC Network with a target to grow this number to 1,500 by 2030. </p>  <p>  Based on feedback from the network of SECs, and in order to facilitate more local sustainable energy activation, my Department and the SEAI are also working to finalise the development of an approach to enhance community activation in the first half of 2022.</p></reply>

The Strategy defines the role of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) &ndash; situated in my Department &ndash; as being to support Government Departments and other public bodies to improve the resilience and security of their IT systems, to better protect services that people rely upon and their data. A key objective of the 2019 Strategy is the continued development of the NCSC. At the beginning of last year, external consultants were commissioned to conduct a Capacity Review and to benchmark the NCSC with similar agencies in Europe and internationally. Minister Ryan and I received the consultants&rsquo; report in June and in July the Government agreed a number of measures to support the continued development of the NCSC over the coming five years, including:   - Increasing the overall fulltime staffing complement of the NCSC to at least 70 over the next 5 years with a first tranche of an additional 20 staff recruited by end 2022 bringing the serving complement to 45. </p>  <p>  - That the General Scheme of a Bill be prepared for Government approval, to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis and provide for related matters including clarity around its mandate. </p>  <p>  - That the new role of Director of the NCSC be established at a salary level equivalent to that of Deputy Secretary in the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  - That the future capital budget for the NCSC be informed by a 5-year NCSC technology strategy.</p>  <p>  - The NCSC will be accommodated within the Department&rsquo;s new Headquarters (HQ) in Beggars Bush. </p>  <p>  - In addition to the creation of 20 new permanent posts in the NCSC, a cyber security graduate training programme will be initiated, with four computer science graduates recruited each year on contracts of a three year duration.</p>  <p>  The Government agreed that the existing cross-Government group overseeing the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy 2019-2024, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications be tasked with developing an action plan for key elements of the capacity review, sponsoring implementation of the review, and reporting to the Minister/Government as necessary. In addition, my officials are in direct contact with relevant Departments and agencies including an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to progress key deliverables including the proposed legislation. </p></reply>

The Government is developing a framework of supports to enable homes, businesses, farms and communities to install renewable generation for their own consumption and receive a payment for any residual electricity they export to the grid. Micro-generation has an important role to play in empowering and driving engagement and participation. It creates opportunities for domestic, community, farming and small commercial customers to take the first steps towards investment in renewable technologies, which can play a role in shaping electricity demand and decarbonising homes and businesses.</p><p>The MSS is targeting support for 380MW of installed micro-generation capacity, to contribute to the target of up to 2.5GW of solar renewables under the Climate Action Plan. Depending on panel size, that equates to over 1 million solar panels, on approximately 70,000 buildings.</p><p>Non-domestic applicants will be eligible to receive the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff, for any exported electricity, at a competitive market rate from their electricity supplier. Projects between 6kW and 50kW will receive a Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff per kWh exported, for a period of 15 years, from their electricity supplier. The CEP will be &euro;0.135/kWh in 2022, which is higher than the current average wholesale electricity price. Any difference between the CEP tariff and wholesale electricity prices will be supported by the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy. Exported volumes of electricity eligible for the Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff will be capped at 80% of generation capacity to incentivise self-consumption.</p><p>It is expected that the Clean Export Premium (CEP) will commence in the third quarter of 2022, when a payment mechanism will be determined by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).</p></reply>

The CEG will become available upon the transposition of Article 21 of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) into Irish law and will be available to both new and existing micro- and small-scale generators who comply with the CRU decision.</p><p>Businesses that use a large amount of electricity, particularly supermarkets, will benefit most when they consume electricity on site from their own micro-generation. The financial business case for micro-generation for these high electricity users is already very strong and the CEG will only benefit the small amount of spilled electricity, if any, that these businesses generate.</p><p>The second phase of the enabling framework is the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) which was approved by Government on 21 December 2021 and will open on a phased basis in 2022. Under the MSS, homes, farms, businesses and community organisations generating up to 6.0kW will be eligible for a Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) grant at the same levels as domestic customers (max &euro;2,400), in addition to the CEG. This grant will become available later in 2022.</p><p>Solar PV is also one of a range of measures funded under the SEAI Communities Energy Grant Scheme which makes grant funding available to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock, and is open to domestic and non-domestic applications. For farm enterprises, grant supports for solar PV are also available from the Department for Agriculture, Food and Marine, under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme as part of the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS).</p></reply>

When the emissions savings from the non-B2 upgrades are included, this is the equivalent of 120,000 B2 upgrades over the period.  As a result, there will a need to deliver, on average, approximately 75,000 B2-equivalent home upgrades per year from 2026 to 2030 to achieve the overall target of 500,000 by 2030.</p><p>Aside from reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, residential retrofit brings additional benefits, including reduced energy costs, improved comfort and health, less dependency on fossil fuels, and improvements in indoor and outdoor air quality.</p><p>The 2021 Climate Action Plan contain a range of measures and targets across all sectors of the economy, including targets for increased renewable electricity generation, an increase in sustainable mobility and the built environment in general.  Other targets in the built environment sector include:</p><p>&middot;Strengthening the existing Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) requirements for new dwellings to effectively ban fossil fuels in new dwellings;</p><p>&middot;Ramp-up of zero emissions heat in commercial buildings; and </p><p>&middot;Increased targets for the roll-out of district heating.  </p><p>Reaching the targets set out in our Climate Action Plans and reducing our GHG emissions will only be achieved by all sectors of the economy and society working together to reach a common goal.</p></reply>

The types of measures developed included widening of footpaths to accommodate social distancing, developing of temporary cycling facilities, enhancing pedestrian movement including additional pedestrianisation, alterations to bus stops/routes, plus the introduction of lower speed limits. Most of the interventions were implemented through temporary construction involving bollards, pencil cones, plastic barriers, road markings and signage.</p>  <p>  Under the Road Traffic Act (as amended) the making of speed limit bye-laws is a reserved function (it requires the approval of the Elected Council Members).</p>  <p>  The two main legislative provisions to enable the implementation of the above physical measures are:  Section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended by Section 37 of the Road Traffic Act 1994) and Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. Neither of these require approval by Councillors as the power to implement them lies with the Council Executive.</p>  <p>  Section 179 of the Planning and Development Act of 2000 outlines the procedures that must be followed for local authority own development, the application of which is then prescribed in Part VIII of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001. Measures introduced under Part VIII do require approval by Councillors.</p></reply>

In addition to the IRHA request, the Department and the RSA were also in receipt of a number of similar queries from several other individual transport operators.</p>  <p>  The derogation was designed to assist in ensuring that key supply chains for food and essential goods were kept open. My Department and the RSA duly considered driver welfare, road safety, operational flexibility and supply chain aspects and reached a decision balancing all of these elements. The flexibilities which were provided are limited in scope and were provided for a limited 21-day period only, applied retrospectively from 9th January 2022 up to 30th January 2022. </p>  <p>  Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 provides a common set of EU rules for maximum daily and fortnightly driving times, as well as daily and weekly minimum rest periods for all drivers of road haulage and passenger transport vehicles. The aim of this set of rules is to avoid distortion of competition, improve road safety and ensure drivers' good working conditions within the European Union. Article 14(2) of the Regulation lays down that Member States may grant, in urgent cases, exceptions from the application of the rules for up to 30 days to transport operations carried out in exceptional circumstances.  There is no requirement for a safety or impact assessment to be undertaken as part of the temporary derogation process allowed under Regulation No. 561/2006.</p>  <p>  The decision to grant the derogation reflects past approaches for dealing with driver shortages during the pandemic.  Ireland, like all Member States, is entitled to grant temporary derogations from the EU driving and resting time rules for periods of up to 30 days when dealing with exceptional circumstances such as those caused by Covid. Other EU member states have granted similar derogations at various points during the crisis to alleviate any supply chain blockages. Information on these can be found on the European Commission website here  - transport.ec.europa.eu/document/download/4b5a1e1c-3260-4f1f-a208-611e7007154f_en - </p>  <p>  Nothing in the derogation changes the rules relating to weekly working time (Working Time Directive for Mobile Workers Directive 2002/15/EC) which must continue to be adhered to. This was highlighted clearly by the RSA in their press release on the matter. In addition, the RSA reminded of the following key points for the implementation of the derogation - </p>  <p>  - Driver safety or other road user&rsquo;s safety must not be compromised. Drivers should not deviate from the rules if it jeopardises road safety nor should they be expected to drive whilst tired. </p>  <p>  - Employers remain responsible for the health and safety of their employees and other road users.</p>  <p>  - The practical implementation of this temporary relaxation of the rules should be agreed by employers with their drivers.</p>  <p>  The derogation is due to expire on 30 January. Since the omicron wave of Covid has now subsided and driver absence levels have reduced,  it is not proposed to extend the derogation beyond this date.</p></reply>

A national charging infrastucture strategy is being developed which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030. My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published for consultation in early 2022.</p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. </p>  <p>  The Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government which will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through the supports for on street chargers. </p>  <p>  Information about the development of the EV charging strategy in the Dublin local authority areas is available here councilmeetings.dublincity.ie/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=33248</p>  <p>  I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure.

Making a change to the validity of an existing certificate requires a change in law.   </p>  <p>  During 2021, extensions were made depending on when an IBT cert was issued, for certs issued between the 01 March 2018 - 30 June 2019. This was to cater for cases where there was a difficulty in getting a test appointment because of the Covid 19 pandemic.  IBT certificates issued beyond this date were not extended; it was felt that the date chosen represented a reasonable concession to motorcyclists looking to obtain a driving test. While the driver testing service did not operate between March and July 2020, outside of this period motorcycle tests continued to be delivered as usual. For that reason, the disruption to motorcycle tests was less significant than to other vehicle types where only essential workers were being tested. </p>  <p>  No further extensions are being considered at this time. </p></reply>

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p>  <p>  There is a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme, which is administered by the SEAI, provides local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs.

This decision impacted four routes including the 20/X20 Dublin/Galway service which ceased operations on 28/07/2021.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator cease operating a specific route, the National Transport Authority (NTA) undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement PSO service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfigured to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services. </p>  <p>  Due to the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X20 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X20 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route.</p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the Authority for reply.

Accordingly, electric vehicles (EVs) are a prominent mitigation measure in the <i>Climate Action Plan</i>and Ireland has set an ambitious target of nearly one million EVs on our roads by 2030. With approximately 47,700 EVs currently in Ireland, this target is very challenging but indicative of the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceiling in future years.</p><p>A national ambition has been firmly established that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero-emission capable. </p><p>The European Commission have indicated that a complete ban of the marketing, import or registration of new ICE vehicles in a single Member State is not compatible with EU law, and an EU-wide approach is therefore required. Ireland was signatory to a non-paper to the Commission earlier this year requesting a phase-out date for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the EU in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as well as the introduction of a legal framework that allows Member States to move ahead by taking action at national level to incentivise early phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars and vans. The paper can be viewed at www.permanentrepresentations.nl/permanent-representations/pr-eu-brussels/documents/publications/2021/03/10/non-paper---transition-to-zero-emission-light-duty-vehicles</p><p>In addition, on Transport Day at COP26, I signed a sponsored declaration to accelerate the transition to 100% zero emission cars and vans. The declaration is an important signal of ambition at a global level. In line with our Programme for Government commitments, Ireland has even greater ambitions, targeting a switch over of one million electric vehicles by 2030 to bring us on a trajectory to achieving electrification of all new car sales well ahead of 2035 </p><p>These declarations are consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions to tackle transport emissions. They follow the recent publication of the Climate Action Plan (CAP) &rsquo;21 which outlines a pathway to a radical and equitable transformation in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector over the next nine years as it moves towards decarbonisation. Car manufacturers are responding to these initiatives by introducing a wide range of electric vehicles to the market, and over the coming decade, I envisage a progressive transition to EVs in our car fleet as electric vehicle technology becomes mainstream .  </p><p>My Department has convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group</i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The <i>EVPP Working Group </i>comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales. Scrappage schemes were discussed as part of these considerations. The Working Group considered the potential of this incentive but concluded that a general  scrappage scheme would entail significant additional costs; however, the Group concluded that niche markets scrappage schemes could potentially play an important role, such as the SPSV  sector. </p><p>Furthermore, considerable progress has been made to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years.</p></reply>

OLEV will co-ordinate measures, including legislation as required, to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric.  In support of EV adoption, a National EV Charging Infrastructure Strategy is in development which will seek to prioritise the delivery of fast and rapid charge point infrastructure over the next 5 years including along the motorway network. </p>  <p>  Specifically, the Strategy will consider the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) which proposes that Member States expand public recharging capacity in line with zero-emission car sales as well as installing dedicated light and heavy-duty vehicle recharging points at regular intervals (every 60kms) on major highways (TEN-T core and comprehensive network) from 2025 onwards.</p>  <p>  AFIR will ensure the rapid and coherent development of an interoperable, wide-spread network of greener refuelling and recharging infrastructure network across the EU. The Government recognises that the provision of sufficient and suitable charging and alternative fuelling facilities is a key enabler of the transition to zero- and low-emission vehicles.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant. In the event that a PMC is not granted by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer an appeal may be made to the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA) who operate out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire.</p><p>The members of the DDMBA wrote to me recently tendering their resignation from the Board. My officials are engaged with the Department of Health and the Public Appointments Service in terms of seeking expressions of interest from medical practitioners to participate in the Board. It is hoped to move this process along as quickly as possible so that appeals can recommence as soon as possible.</p><p>Requests for appeal hearings can be sent to the DDMBA secretary based in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. New appeal hearing dates will be issued once the new Board is in place. Assessments for the primary medical certificate, by the HSE, are continuing to take place. The number of applications for a Primary Medical Certificate and the number of those that were successful are a matter for the Department of Health.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.</p><p>I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>This the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p><p>It is anticipated that the NDIS working group will be meeting shortly. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-25a.462.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012500066#WRH04600"><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>includes a commitment to work to remove dual pricing from the insurance market. As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank completed its Review and published its final report into differential pricing, along with a public consultation on proposals to strengthen the consumer protection framework, in July 2021.</p><p>Among the Central Bank&rsquo;s proposals is a ban on &ldquo;price walking&rdquo; in the motor and home insurance markets for personal consumers. Price walking, or a &ldquo;loyalty penalty&rdquo;, occurs when consumers are charged higher premiums, relative to the expected cost, the longer they remain with an insurance provider. The Central Bank has proposed that its new measures would come into force on 1 July 2022.</p><p>The public consultation on the proposals ran until 22 October 2021, and the process was independently managed by the Central Bank. As is the usual practise, neither my Department nor I made a formal submission to the consultation, but the Central Bank kept the Department updated on developments. However, Government's pro-consumer policy on this matter is well known and has been articulated to the Bank on a number of occasions. </p><p>I welcome this proposal, and believe it represents a balanced approach that will protect customers who wish to remain with their current insurer, while still allowing those who prefer to shop around to receive discounts from new providers for doing so. </p><p>The Central Bank has indicated it has the necessary powers to implement its proposals, including banning price walking. The Government is keen to ensure that this is effective. That is why, in the <i>Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill</i>, we have proposed a requirement for the Bank to provide a report on whatever it ultimately decides to implement to facilitate a timely assessment, thereby allowing the Government to act swiftly if further action is needed in order to protect consumers from any unfair loyalty penalty.</p></reply>

The relief is commonly known as SARP (Special Assignee Relief Programme).</p><p>The aim of the relief is to reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals in their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish-based operations of their employer or an associated company, thereby facilitating the creation of jobs and the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland.</p><p>SARP provides for relief from Income Tax on 30% of income over &euro;75,000, subject to an upper income threshold of &euro;1,000,000, where applicable. There is no exemption from USC. PRSI is payable where the individual is not liable to social insurance contributions in his or her home country. School fees of up to &euro;5,000 per annum and expenses incurred on one trip home per year, where they are paid for by the employer, are not subject to Income Tax, USC or PRSI. </p><p>I am advised that the latest costs available for the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) can be found in the 2019 SARP report which is published on the Revenue website and as part of the Budget 2022 Tax Expenditures Report on the Government's Budget 2022 website. </p><p>The cost of SARP for 2018 and 2019 (the latest year for which data are available), can be found below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cost (&euro;m)</td>       <td>42.4</td>       <td>38.2</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

While Virtual Asset Service Providers are subject to AML/CTF requirements, however, they are not subject to prudential and conduct of business requirements at this time. </p>  <p>  On 24 September 2020 the European Commission released its Digital Finance Package (www.ec.europa.eu/info/publications/200924-digital-finance-proposals). This contains a proposal for a new EU legislative framework for the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which aims to enable and regulate markets in crypto-assets, including asset-referenced tokens (also known as 'stablecoins') and utility tokens as well as the tokenisation of traditional financial assets and wider use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in financial services.</p>  <p>  It is expected that MiCA will introduce provisions on advertising and marketing to ensure that marketing information should be clear, fair and not misleading. MiCA will be an EU regulation, not a Directive, so it will be applicable in Ireland as soon as the regulation comes into force.</p>  <p>  My department has been working extensively in the negotiations relating to MiCA, with technical advice being provided across the department and the Central Bank of Ireland. The Central Bank informs me that it supports and welcomes a harmonised approach towards developing an appropriate regulatory framework for the markets in crypto-assets. </p>  <p>  At an EU level, while the development of an appropriate regulatory framework continues, it is important to highlight that there is a consensus to adopt a conservative prudential approach towards crypto-assets which is line with that set out in the EBA&rsquo;s January 2019 report (www.eba.europa.eu/eba-reports-on-crypto-assets).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank continues to identify and closely monitor risks associated with crypto-assets, and has issued warnings to consumers on the risks of buying virtual currencies (www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/consumer-notices/consumer-warning-on-virtual-currencies). These warnings are more relevant than ever due to the marked increase in digital payments and transactions since the start of the COVID pandemic. </p></reply>

I strongly welcome the re-opening of the Commission&rsquo;s review, as I believe now is the right time to discuss possible reforms to the existing fiscal framework in Europe. </p>  <p>  To date, the Commission has not brought forward any specific proposals for reforms to the governance framework. However, as I have re-iterated on several occasions, I support efforts to increase the transparency and predictability of the framework.</p>  <p>  The discussions on reform of the framework will be complex and take place against the backdrop of a number of fiscal challenges.  The most immediate of these is the challenge posed by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the public finances of EU Member States. Strong coordinated policy actions at EU and national levels (including the activation of the General Escape Clause of the Stability and Growth Pact) helped to reduce the societal and economic impact of the pandemic. While these measures were undoubtedly necessary and prudent, they have nevertheless resulted in significant increases in deficit and debt ratios throughout the EU.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a number of more medium-term fiscal and structural challenges were already visible on the horizon before the pandemic hit. Amongst these are the challenges posed by the so-called &lsquo;dual transitions&rsquo; to a digital and green economy. Concurrently, population ageing over the coming decades will also have a significant impact on the public finances. In this context, I recognise that a balance must be met between the need to finance additional investment requirements and the equally important need to ensure financial sustainability, particularly given the impact of the pandemic on the fiscal positions of Member States.</p>  <p>  The structural budgetary challenges we are now facing, along with the economic interdependencies and risks which existed when the European Monetary Union was established, all speak to the continued need for fiscal rules at a European level. However, such rules must be appropriately calibrated in order to be credible. The rules must also contain a degree of flexibility, to allow Governments to tackle unanticipated shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, effective economic and budgetary coordination remains a key building block for ensuring stability and growth in the EU and for strengthening the Economic and Monetary Union. Maintaining the sustainability of public finances as an objective of the fiscal rules is essential in this respect.</p></reply>

While hairdressing services apply the 9% rate from 1 November 2020, services consisting of the care of the human body, including beauticians, are subject to the 13.5% rate.</p>  <p>  This arises from the fact that many of goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, including services related to care of the human body, have their basis under an EU derogation that provides that as Ireland applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue applying that reduced rate to those items.  However, this is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%.  These are known as &lsquo;parked&rsquo; items, and are provided for under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive.  As the services provided by beauticians are part of these parked items, it is not possible for Ireland to apply the rate of 9% to them.</p></reply>

The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 was published on 23 June and enacted on 19 July 2021 and extended EWSS to 31 December 2021.   The Finance Act 2021, was published on 21 October 2021 and enacted on 21 December 2021 and extended EWSS to 30 April 2022 for eligible employers who are correctly registered for EWSS on or before 31 December 2021.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy, will be aware, eligibility to EWSS is based on the employer demonstrating that its business is likely to experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders during a specific reference period and that this disruption to business is caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.   In addition, the business must also have tax clearance.   </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the scheme, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances at the end of each month and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.   For July to December 2021, employers provide to Revenue details of this eligibility review on a monthly Eligibility Review Form (ERF), filed through ROS.   This form assists employers in determining whether they are eligible, ensuring timely deregistration and avoiding incorrect subsidy claims.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that employers who became ineligible for EWSS from 1 December 2021 on foot of the eligibility review they undertook at the end of November 2021 could contact Revenue via My Enquiries by 15 January 2022 to amend the December projections included in their November 2021 ERF, where the projections they prepared on 30 November were overstated having regard to the public health restrictions introduced on 20 December.   Once the December projections have been updated by Revenue, the employer can then amend their December payroll submissions to include the EWSS claim.  Any December payroll submissions already filed, that included an EWSS claim, do not need to be resubmitted. These are automatically processed by Revenue once the November ERF is amended. These employers were also required to file their December ERF, by 15 January 2022.   </p>  <p>  On 21 December 2021, in light of public health restrictions announced on 17 December 2021, I announced a re-opening of the scheme for certain employers who might otherwise be ineligible.   These were employers who were previously eligible for EWSS, but as their business activity was at a level where they would not have met the turnover qualification criteria, they were not eligible on 31 December 2021. In light of the restrictions introduced last December, some businesses may return to a position where they require EWSS support and as such the EWSS re-opened to certain employers from 1 January 2022. </p>  <p>  Where employers determined they were eligible to re-enter the scheme, they could do so by completing and submitting a short template of required information to Revenue via MyEnquiries by 15 January 2022. The relevant template and further information can be found in Revenue&rsquo;s guidelines on how employers can re-enter the EWSS.    </p>  <p>  If employers in either of those cohorts missed the 15 January deadline, I am advised that a submission can be submitted to Revenue by 31 January requesting that their late submission be considered.   This submission should include details as to the reason the initial deadline was not met.   I am further advised that Revenue will assess each late submission on a case by case basis to determine whether the late submission will be accepted.</p></reply>

Paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 1 provides for an exemption in respect of the supply of professional dental services.</p>  <p>  The exemption from VAT in respect of dental services is not dependent on the legal form of the taxable person supplying the service. It is the nature of the service that informs the VAT treatment. The legislation which transposes Article 132 of the Directive, and Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation of the legislation, ensures that the exemption from VAT to the supply of dental services is applied consistently and in a manner which is not dependent on the legal form of the person supplying the service.

To assist Local Authorities in managing the coastline for coastal erosion, the OPW has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion (including erosion rates) under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) and the results of this study have been published on the OPW website. This data enables Local Authorities to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties.  </p>  <p>  The Local Authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources. If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures. </p>  <p>  The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme since 2009, under which applications for funding from local authorities for small-localised works are considered for measures costing up to &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding for coastal risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects that meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial.  It is a matter for each local authority to ensure that all the necessary environmental, statutory and regulatory approvals are in place prior to any works being undertaken. </p>  <p>  The OPW guidelines for funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme are available on the OPW website at www.gov.ie/opw</p>  <p>  While the OPW has no application in respect of a sea wall at this location., in 2018, Donegal County Council was approved funding of &euro;76,500 under this scheme to carry out a Coastal Erosion Risk Management Study at Magheraroarty known as the Ballyness Bay Coastal Flooding and Erosion Risk Management Study.  Works on the study are ongoing, The completed study will inform the appropriate measures necessary to address the coastal erosion risk into the future and identify any measures necessary to protect the identified community/business assets at risk.</p></reply>

The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies also provides that the CEO of each Commercial State Body shall hold office subject to the terms and conditions as determined by the Board of the State Body with the consent of the relevant Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the above, following proposals from the Board of HRI, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine sought my consent to the terms for the appointment of a new CEO. To fully appraise the proposal, my Department requested that further information be provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in support of the proposal, including a business case and an independent assessment by NewERA. </p>  <p>  Having considered the business case and supporting recommendation from NewERA, I provided my consent to the terms proposed. i.e. a salary of &euro;190,773 and the provision of the standard superannuation terms for CEOs of Commercial State Bodies. The terms do not represent an increase on the terms for the outgoing CEO. There is no scheduled increases to the salary in years two and three of the contract. </p>  <p>  I refer the Deputy to the standard superannuation arrangements for CEOs of Commercial State Bodies also published at the following link: </p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/7adff-governance/?referrer=www.govacc.per.gov.ie/governance-of-state-bodies/</p>  <p>  The terms for the CEO post are as outlined above. Due to General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) around personal data, information in relation to the specific superannuation terms applying to the individual is of a personal nature and is unable to be provided. Furthermore, as a Commercial State Body, documentation relating to Horse Racing Ireland and the assessment by NewERA contain information that may be of a commercially sensitive nature. The documents also contain personal information.  </p></reply>

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works &euro;1.3 billion flood relief investment programme nationally, as part of the NDP 2018-2030, from which the relevant funding for the Enniscorthy scheme will be made available.  On completion, the scheme will protect 236 properties in the town.</p>  <p>  The proposed scheme includes river channel widening, river deepening, bridge relocation, and the construction of extensive glass panelled flood walls through the town.

It is important to note that under Section 7.E of the Arterial Drainage Act Regulations 2019, the Minister can (a) make an order confirming the scheme, (b) refuse to confirm the scheme, or (c) refer the scheme back to the Commissioners for revision in specified respects. </p>  <p>  There is a statutory obligation incumbent upon the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform to ensure that all aspects of complex legal and environmental compliance issues are satisfactorily resolved before a decision can be made in relation to the Enniscorthy scheme, on the basis of the options available to him. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently awaiting finalised reports and recommendations from the expert environmental consultants in relation to this matter before making that determination.  A decision in relation to the Enniscorthy Flood Relief Scheme, as per the three options available to him, will be made at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

Under this procedure, a household may apply for support to one housing authority only, which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or the authority that agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.  A household, meeting either the residence or local connection condition, may specify up to three areas of choice for receipt of support in the areas of all housing authorities in the county and city concerned and, if qualified, will be entered on the housing waiting list of each of those housing authorities. </p>  <p>  Consistent with the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is considered to be a social housing support and consequently households in receipt of a payment under the HAP scheme are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list. However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, local authorities are also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  Guidelines on inter-authority movement were issued to local authorities to facilitate the movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant wishes to access rented accommodation, with HAP support, in another local authority area. Inter authority movement is, however, subject to certain conditions, such as the relevant Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority. </p>  <p>  In order to maintain equity between all tenants in receipt of social housing support, inter-authority movement for HAP will be facilitated without reference to Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands in areas that offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes, as no change to existing treatment is involved in such areas. For example, in Dublin, the four local authority areas currently offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes. </p>  <p>  However, HAP tenants who avail of inter-authority movement, can only be offered access to the transfer list of the originating local authority.</p>  <p>  The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities. The making of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.</p></reply>

Government approved the enhanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2Bn. The comprehensive changes include:</p>  <p>  - The current 90% maximum grant will be increased to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1-5.</p>  <p>  - The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000.</p>  <p>  - The grant calculation methodology in respect of option 1 remediation will be based on a cost per square foot  with costings to be set by my  Department in consultation with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). An indicative rate of &euro;145 per square foot for the first 1,000 sq foot with a sliding scale thereafter has been announced by my Department and this will be subject to review as required in line with construction cost changes. In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate rate for blockwork removal and replacement following consultation with SCSI.</p>  <p>  - A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home. </p>  <p>  - Alternative accommodation and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 will be available for essential immediate repair works recommended by a building professional as part of the Building Condition Assessment process.</p>  <p>  - In relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a second grant option, will be available for such a home in the future if blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work subsequently proves defective in accordance with the IS:465 standard.</p>  <p>  - A new independent appeals process will be introduced.</p>  <p>  - The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used. Opportunities for the State to acquire such rental properties for social housing purposes will also be examined.</p>  <p>  Full details in relation to the changes announced are available at the following link;</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e365e-minister-obrien-announces-enhancements-to-the-defective-concrete-block-scheme/</p>  <p>  I aim to bring the required primary legislation to give effect to the enhanced scheme before the Oireachtas as soon as possible with Spring 2022 being the indicative target timeline.</p>  <p>  In the immediate term I intend making amendments to the Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020 which will allow for the recoupment of Engineer fees to homeowners who have applied for entry into the scheme. Furthermore, as part of these amended regulations, &euro;5,000 will be recoupable as an allowable cost under the scheme for essential immediate repair works which are deemed necessary by a homeowners engineer under a Building Condition Assessment report.</p></reply>

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through its Office of Environmental Enforcement, exercises general supervision in relation to the performance of these functions by local authorities. </p>  <p>  In addition, local authority functions, including enforcement activities, are set out under Part 6 of the European Union (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2017. These regulations, which give effect to Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme, are designed to prevent pollution of surface waters and groundwater from agricultural sources and to protect and improve water quality.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on these and on other programmes that will help address issues effecting water quality, such as the River Basin Management Plan and the CAP Strategic Plan.  </p>  <p>The current Good Agricultural Practice Regulations run to the 31 March 2022 and a new Nitrates Action Programme will be published in March. A public consultation on the Nitrates Action Programme's Natura Impact Statement and Strategic Environmental Assessment is currently ongoing and the outcomes of this process will inform the final Nitrates Action Programme once all submissions are received (www.gov.ie/en/consultation/72a50-public-consultation-on-the-natura-impact-statement-and-strategic-environmental-assessment-for-irelands-draft-fifth-nitrates-action-programme/). The closing date for this consultation is the 26th   January. The Nitrates Action Programme and the associated Regulations apply to all farms. </p>  <p>  Improving compliance and enforcement with the Regulations is a key measure in the draft Nitrates Action Programme.  </p>  <p>  Farmers are provided with detailed information on how to comply with the current regulations and on how to improve farm sustainability more generally. This information comes from local authorities; from the Nitrates Section of the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine and from Teagasc advisory services as well as through communications from programmes such as the Agricultural Catchments Programme and the Signpost Farms programme.</p>  <p>  The current River Basin Management Plan for Ireland also saw the establishment of the Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme (ASSAP) to promote and encourage sustainable farming while meeting stringent water quality requirements. This initiative is an innovative collaboration between Government and industry and is supported by my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and by Dairy Industry Ireland.</p>  <p>  The initiative supports a free one-to-one sustainability advisory service to farmers to encourage behavioural change, facilitate knowledge transfer and achieve better on-farm environmental outcomes.  </p>  <p>  On compliance assurance, inspections are currently conducted by local authorities with assistance from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility within the regulations for oversight of local authority enforcement functions and for reporting on implementation and compliance with the requirements of the regulations. This is managed through the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement and through the collaborative Network for Ireland&rsquo;s Environmental Compliance and Enforcement (NIECE network). </p></reply>

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant. The borrower surrenders their property to their lender who sells it to a MTR provider which can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd.  The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.   </p>  <p>  To the end of December 2021, 1682 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013. The 1682 households in the scheme represent 2738 adults and 2274 children who have remained living in their homes and communities. As of that date, 720 active cases were being progressed under the scheme. The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme on the Housing Agency's website at the following link: www.housingagency.ie/housing-information/mortgage-rent-statistics  </p>  <p>  Both the Programme for Government and Housing for All commits to strengthening the MTR scheme and ensuring that it is helping those who need it. Building on the significant amendments already made to the scheme in 2017, the 2021 Review, published on the 24 January 2022, examined the impact of these changes and what further changes would benefit those in need of the scheme. While the scheme is performing well, it was assessed that some further enhancements were needed to enable more households in need of State support with their long-term housing needs to avail of this scheme. Four broad categories of actions are identified in the review, including:</p>  <p>  a) broadening eligibility criteria;</p>  <p>  b) improving the scheme process, structure and financing;</p>  <p>  c) increasing communication and awareness raising; and</p>  <p>  d) responding to developments around mortgage arrears solutions. </p>  <p>  As part of the enhancements to broadening the eligibility criteria to ensure more households will be eligible for the scheme there is a new amendment to allow flexibility where the household concerned is over accommodated (i.e. has more than 2 spare bedrooms above the current needs of the household). Flexibility on over accommodation may be allowed where:</p>  <p>  a. the borrower or one of the joint borrowers is aged 65 and over</p>  <p>  b. the borrower, one of the joint borrowers or one of the borrower&rsquo;s dependents has a disability and the property has been significantly and permanently adapted to their needs</p>  <p>c.   the borrower, one of the joint borrowers or one of the borrower&rsquo;s dependents has a disability and the property is specifically suitable to their needs without adaptations</p>  <p>  In the case of (b) and (c) above, the household must also qualify for Social Housing Support on disability, medical or compassionate grounds in line with the local authority&rsquo;s allocation policy. Such flexibility is subject to the local authority or AHB (as appropriate) reserving the right to accommodate the household in more appropriate accommodation, if available, in the future.</p>  <p>  This is one of a number of changes outlined in the 2021 Review and will be implemented under the scheme from February 14, 2022. </p>  <p>  The 2021 Review of the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme for people who have borrowed from commercial private lending institutions is available on the Department's website under Publications: www.gov.ie/en/publication/ed57b-2021-review-of-the-mortgage-to-rent-scheme-for-borrowers-of-commercial-private-lending-institutions/</p></reply>

In this regard, the assignment of local authority staff to a particular function, such as the delivery of affordable housing, is a matter for the Chief Executive.</p><p>However, as part of the measures to support institutional capacity, Housing for All commits to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects and recognises that this requires the resourcing of the housing services of local authorities.  Last year, my Department worked closely with local authorities, through the CCMA and the Housing Delivery Coordination Office, to identify capacity constraints and additional staffing resources required to deliver the social housing targets set out in Housing for All.  Following this analysis, I approved over 200 new posts for local authorities.<b></b></p><p>My Department, with the Housing Delivery Co-ordination Office, is now undertaking a review of affordable housing staff resources similar to the recent review of social housing delivery of local authority capacity.</p><p>Key considerations in this review include the number of local authorities with identified affordability constraints, the type of structure (administrative/professional staff) necessary to deliver affordable housing and the degree of overlap/synergy there might be with the additional support being provided for social housing delivery. </p><p>The review of affordable housing staffing needs is dependent on finalisation of Housing Delivery Actions Plans and is intended to be initiated by mid-February.</p></reply>

This must be expended in the following year- i.e. it is not permissible to further defer any surplus. Therefore the total Capital surplus that could have been brought forward into 2022 was &euro;289.72m, however, deferred surrender is limited to 10% of the total Capital allocation. This Department sought to carry the maximum permissible limit, some &euro;275.8m.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, with additional supports, including the provision of family supports, provided to families by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>Supporting individuals and families facing homelessness is a key Government priority. <i>Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland</i>commits to working to eradicate homelessness by 2030 and provides detail on how the Government is approaching this as a priority.  It includes eighteen distinct actions on homelessness.  Two of these actions relate specifically to the provision of supports for families and children and in enabling their exit from homelessness.  There is a commitment to enhance family support and prevention and early intervention services for children and their families through a multi-agency and coordinated response, and the dissemination of innovative practice.  There is also a commitment to identify and provide enhanced tenancy sustainment supports to families experiencing long-term homelessness to help them exit from homelessness and maintain their homes.  These actions are being delivered with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Tusla.</p><p>In relation to the housing insecurity experienced by lone parents, in should be noted that local authorities are independent in the exercise of their functions and, as such, applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. Lone parents are entitled to access all of the housing support delivery mechanisms on an equal basis with all other citizens.</p><p>However, the Government is determined to ensure that housing policy addresses the needs of those who experience social exclusion in our society by taking firm action. <i>Housing for All</i>contains a specific commitment to a Fresh Start principle which will be of assistance to lone parents who may wish to apply for affordable housing or a local authority home loan. </p><p>The increases in family homelessness seen in recent months are a serious concern for my Department and for the Government.  We are acting to address this &ndash; in the short term and strategically over the months and years ahead. Appreciable improvements have been made on the situation we were facing two years ago when homelessness was at its highest. Over 4,000 adults and their dependant children exited homelessness in the first 9 months of 2021, with data for the full year to be available at the end of January.  All of these exits were to homes with tenancies.</p><p>The Government will continue to prioritise responses for all families, including lone parents, experiencing homelessness and this is being reflected in both strategic policy and in specific actions.</p></reply>

Reasons for presentations are varied and may (in a small number of instances) include those who have left their home or a domestic violence refuge or may have suffered from sexual or gender based violence.  It should be noted, however, that the primary responsibility in this area is with Tusla, who I am advised provide funding for this issue. </p><p>My Department also provides capital funding to local authorities via the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), which is available to Approved Housing Bodies in the development of new refuges. </p><p>Through CAS, local organisations have had funding support for refuges in recent years in Galway City, Louth and South Dublin and proposals from a number of other areas are at various stages of advancement. CAS funding remains available to support refuges and in that regard, I expect that the publication by Tusla soon of its Review of the provision of Accommodation for Victims of Domestic Violence, will assist in developing a plan to address refuge provision and related matters.

At the end of Q3 2021, 97,600 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were more than 62,300 households actively in receipt of HAP support and over 33,600 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme. </p>  <p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is also an important contributor to social housing supply. It places responsibility on local authorities to meet the accommodation needs of people in receipt of Rent Supplement for 18 months or longer, and who are assessed as having a long-term housing need. RAS has provided a more structured,  accommodation-based approach to the use of the private rented sector to meet long-term housing need, thereby eliminating dependence on temporary income support payments through Rent Supplement. The scheme is delivered by local authorities who source accommodation from the private market and Approved Housing Bodies. At the end of Quarter 3, 2021, there were 17,318 tenancies supported under RAS. </p>  <p>Legislation provides that both HAP and RAS are considered to be a form of social housing support. Households in receipt of HAP and RAS are therefore, not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list. However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP and RAS, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing through a transfer list.</p>  <p>Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 requires all housing authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p>  <p>The practical operation of transfer lists is, therefore, a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities, and the number of persons on the housing transfer list is also a matter for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>The Housing for All strategy is the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade. The annual targets include the delivery of 88,400 new social homes and 53,800 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency (LDA) and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p>  <p>The projected number for new HAP tenancy set-ups in 2022 is 14,000. The projected number for new RAS tenancy set-ups in 2022 is 800. Projections for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process.  However, as the numbers of new build social homes increases under Housing for All, there will be a reduced reliance on HAP and RAS.</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Operation of the Rent Supplement Scheme is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

The Government policy is to increase the supply of social housing through build programmes and I have issued targets to local authorities for period 2022-2026 to deliver 47,600 new build social homes.   However, while we will continue to support households in HAP tenancies and to support households on the social housing waiting list to obtain a HAP-supported tenancy in the private-rented sector,  as the numbers of new build social homes increases under Housing for All, there will be a reduced reliance on HAP. </p>  <p>  In October 2020, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, published a Spending Review on the Social Housing Build Programme.

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs.</p><p>Indications of increased construction activity are becoming evident which will help increase the supply and availability of housing. There is a strong supply pipeline, with latest Commencement Notices data showing a total number of 30,724 residential dwellings commenced in 2021. The 2021 total is almost equal to the combined totals for 2016 and 2017 (30,816).</p><p>With regard to the number of homes built, in the year to Quarter 3 2021, almost 21,000 new dwellings were completed. This represents a 6.8% year-on-year increase. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) will publish its Q4 2021 New Dwelling Completions data in the coming days. Completions for 2022 and 2023 are projected to exceed the <i>Housing for All</i>targets of 24,600 and 29,000 respectively. The Central Bank forecasts that some 27,000 and 31,000 homes will be completed in 2022 and 2023 respectively.</p><p>The most recent CSO figures on planning permissions also show a strong pipeline, with 39,077 units (apartments/flats and houses) granted planning permission in the 12 months to end Q3 2021. </p><p>With regard to Local Authority housing delivery, and in line with <i>Housing for All</i>, each Local Authority has developed and submitted a Housing Delivery Action Plan to my Department in December 2021. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery, as appropriate, over the period 2022-2026. My Department is currently engaging with local authorities on these plans, in particular their alignment with the targets and policy objectives set out in <i>Housing for All</i>. The Plans will be published in Quarter 2. </p><p>The Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) published by my Department shows the ongoing delivery of social housing across the country. The CSR provides an outlined breakdown of Local Authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) social housing new-build activity from 2016 to date. The CSR provides details of the individual projects that make up the new Build programme for each Local Authority. The most recent report for Quarter 3, shows that there were 9,746 social homes onsite with an additional 9,559 homes at design and tender stage. During Quarter 3 2021, 105 new construction schemes, (1,780 homes) were added to the pipeline. </p><p>To support Local Authorities in the delivery of affordable homes, the Affordable Housing Fund has replaced the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The Fund has been open for applications from 1 September 2021. My Department has actively engaged with the Local Authorities to support and encourage them to develop and submit proposals. The homes that Local Authorities deliver under the Affordable Housing Fund will be sold at least 15% below open market value in respect of Affordable Purchase homes and in the order of 25% below open market value prices in respect of Cost Rental homes. </p><p>The delivery of Cost Rental homes is a key affordability measure under <i>Housing for All</i>, with State-backed rents that are in the order of 25% below what they would be on the private market. 65 cost rental homes have been tenanted to date, in developments in Balbriggan and Leixlip, and a further 1,580 cost rental homes are targeted for delivery in 2022.</p><p>Furthermore, the Land Development Agency (LDA) has a key role in the delivery of affordable homes, including through &ldquo;Project Tosaigh&rdquo; aimed at accelerating the delivery of up to 5,000 homes. The first delivery stream of this LDA initiative to bring privately developed units to market affordably and quickly was launched on 12 November 2021. The LDA issued a call for Expressions of Interest for advance purchase agreements to developers, with a target scheme scale in excess of 150 units per development, in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The Expressions of Interest submitted are currently being assessed by the LDA with their priority focus and engagement being on schemes with potential delivery in 2022 and 2023.</p><p>Increased capacity of the public service to deliver, along with the streamlining of approval processes in relation to housing delivery are key priorities under <i>Housing for All</i>. Over 200 additional posts have been sanctioned and are in the process of being filled across Local Authority housing delivery teams in order to deliver on the scale of <i>Housing for All's</i>ambition.</p><p>Increasing the supply of housing as set out in <i>Housing for All</i>is the top priority for me and the Government and we have made a good start on our path towards this goal. However, I acknowledge that we are coming from a low base of supply and that it will take some time before the full benefits of the strategy are tangible to our citizens.</p><p>The housing challenge remains immense, and continues to be affected by ongoing challenges including COVID-19 related delays, supply chain difficulties and inflationary pressure. The cost of housing &ndash; for those buying or renting - will continue to be a challenge in the short-term and, while we do not underestimate the difficulties this is causing for our citizens, I am confident that the delivery of <i>Housing for All</i>will create a sustainable housing system into the future.  </p></reply>

The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. It is available for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The Local Authority Home Loan can also be used for the purchase of homes through State schemes such as the Tenant Purchase Scheme and Affordable Housing Schemes, with the exception of the First Home Scheme. </p><p>The Local Authority Home Loan assists borrowers in securing an affordable, long-term fixed rate mortgage to purchase a home of their own. The Scheme supports homeownership amongst lower to moderate income households by reducing the cost of mortgage finance and increasing the level of financing available, particularly for single applicants in urban areas. For clarity, the Local Authority Home Loan supports private home ownership and is separate from the qualification for social housing.</p><p>A 'Fresh Start' principle also applies to the Local Authority Home Loans scheme. This means that people who are divorced, legally separated/separated or the relationship has ended and have no interest in, or any financial obligation for any borrowings in respect of the family home are eligible to apply under this scheme. People who have undergone personal insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings will also be eligible to apply for the Local Authority Home Loans Scheme.</p><p>Under the Local Authority Home Loan scheme the income ceiling for a single applicant in counties where the scheme's house price limit is &euro;320,000 (Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow) has been increased from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000. In the rest of the country, where the scheme&rsquo;s house price limit is &euro;250,000, the income ceiling for a single applicant will remain at &euro;50,000.

Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4b per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn in funding through the Housing Finance Agency over a five year period. </p><p>The Department's administrative and funding measures are put in place to support and foster the development of social and affordable housing and to ensure value for money for the taxpayer. Under Housing for All, a whole of Government approach is being taken to further improve and streamline those processes which support the delivery of housing across all tenures. Increasing the overall supply of housing is at the centre of the Housing for All plan. This includes direct investment in social and affordable housing, reforms to ensure availability of land, measures to support the viability of development and ensuring there is sufficient investment and capacity to support housing construction.</p><p>The latest data on Commencement Notices shows that a total number of 30,724 residential dwellings commenced in 2021: a 42% increase compared to 2020 (21,686). Of the 30,724 new dwellings commenced in 2021, 82.7% of these were scheme developments (25,409) and 17.3% were single houses (5,315).</p><p>In the year to Quarter 3 2021, almost 21,000 new dwellings were completed.

The most recent CSO figures on planning permissions also show a strong pipeline with almost 40,000 units (apartments/flats and houses) granted planning permission in the 12 months to end Q3 2021.</p><p>A detailed Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) is published each quarter by my Department. The CSR provides details of the individual social housing new build projects, that make up the new build programme for each local authority.

I will be holding another summit with local authority chief executives in February, focused on the implementation of Housing for All measures.</p><p>A key action under Housing for All required local authorities to prepare a Housing Delivery Action Plan, setting out details of social and affordable housing delivery over the next five years.

Our annual targets include the delivery of 90,000 new social homes and 54,000 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency (LDA) and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p><p>In relation to increased delivery of social homes, there is a target to build 9,000 new social homes in 2022 and there is a strong pipeline in place to support this delivery. The Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) published each quarter provides scheme level detail on social housing new build activity in each local authority, including those delivered by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). The most recent report for Quarter 3 2021 shows that there were 9,746 social homes under construction onsite with an additional 9,559 homes at various stages of design and procurement. </p><p>Through Housing for All, we are also strengthening the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects. I approved over 200 new staff for local authority housing delivery teams in December 2021. These posts will increase the capacity of local authorities to initiate, manage and deliver new build housing schemes. </p><p>The Housing Agency will also act as a centre of expertise to support local authority and AHB housing delivery. Additional resources are being allocated to the Housing Agency to fulfil this role. </p><p>In relation to affordable housing, the Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever standalone affordable housing legislation, established a basis for four new affordable housing measures. These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p><p>It is anticipated that the first affordable purchase homes under the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will be made available in Cork in February. Cork City Council indicated the prices to be &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling. This will be followed by a Fingal County Council supported affordable purchase development (Dun Emer). Fingal County Council have indicated these will cost &euro;166,000 for a 2-bed apartment and between &euro;206,000 and &euro;258,000 for 3-bed dwellings.</p><p>Separately, as part of Housing for All, additional funding of &euro;1bn was committed to the Land Development Agency in order for it to deliver on its pipeline of housing. This includes Project Tosaigh under which the LDA will enter into forward purchase arrangements to kick-start stalled private developments and increase the supply of affordable housing. The LDA initiated a call on 12 November 2021 targeting a scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development and is currently assessing the proposals received.</p><p>Similarly, the Housing Delivery Coordination Office (within the Local Government Management Agency) issued a call to secure additional affordable homes across 14 local authorities with the most acute affordability constraint. This call is also focused on stalled private developments but targets smaller scale developments than the LDA initiative.</p><p>Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act provided for the establishment of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland. Despite the impacts of Covid-19, 65 Cost Rental homes were tenanted in 2021 (25 in Balbriggan Co, Dublin, and 40 in Leixlip Co. Kildare). Over 700 Cost Rental homes will be delivered by AHBs in 2022, with more to be delivered by the LDA.</p><p>The First Home shared equity scheme, under Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing newly constructed homes on the private market. This scheme will be available at a national level and will incorporate regional price caps based on median house price sales. A Designated Activity Company to operate this scheme was incorporated last December. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications in Q2 of this year.</p><p>In addition to these schemes, several affordability measures which promote housing supply, such as the Help-to-Buy scheme continue to be made available to eligible applicants. The Help-to-Buy incentive supports first-time buyers in meeting the deposit requirements for newly-built houses or apartments, as well as self-build homes. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to first-time buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home. The Help-to-Buy scheme has already helped over 22,000 first-time buyers achieve the deposit required for a new home. <i>Budget 2022</i>confirmed an extension to the Help-to-Buy scheme up to 2022 and committed to undertake a full review of the scheme.</p><p>Finally, the new Local Authority Home Loan scheme commenced on 4 January 2022 as a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. This scheme incorporates a lower interest rate, higher income eligibility and more flexible home size requirements than previously applied.</p><p>Our multi-faceted approach to housing delivery will see greatly increased supply which we recognise is key to addressing inflationary pressures.

This is why the schemes in the Affordable Housing Act provide for a household specific assessment of affordability.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Affordable Housing Act, each household's capacity to purchase a modest home relative to the regional market will be considered.  Where households are deemed not to be able purchase a home at its cost on the private market, support to bridge the shortfall may be made available through two separate affordable purchase schemes. More specifically, first-time buyers purchasing new homes will be supported by a bridging of the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. </p><p>It is anticipated that the first affordable purchase homes under the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will be made available in Cork in February.

In September 2021, I issued individual targets to each local authority for the delivery of new build social homes, with the following targets set out for Longford and Westmeath local authorities, including their targets for 2022 - <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2022</th>       <th>2023</th>       <th>2024</th>       <th>2025</th>       <th>2026</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>75</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>76</td>       <td>82</td>       <td>83</td>       <td>391</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>220</td>       <td>124</td>       <td>126</td>       <td>136</td>       <td>139</td>       <td>745</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition, each local authority has recently provided a Housing Delivery Action Plan which is to set out details on how local authorities will deliver their housing targets. I received Action Plans from both Longford and Westmeath Councils in December 2021 and my Department is now reviewing these and where needed, will engage further with local authorities for further detail. The Plans will be published in Quarter 2, following the conclusion of the review process.</p><p>By way of tracking social housing delivery, a Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) is published each quarter by my Department. This provides details of the individual social housing new build projects, which make up the new build programme for each local authority, including Longford and Westmeath Councils. It will be these schemes which will form the basis for new build delivery of social homes in the local authorities during 2022 and beyond. The most recent CSR publication covers the period up to the end of Quarter 3 2021, and is available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/feea9-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q3-2021/.</p><p>I'm keen that all local authorities progress their social housing schemes as quickly as possible and that they receive the support of public representatives in the advancement of their programmes.</p></reply>

One of the ways the Government are trying to increase the supply of more affordable homes to rent under Housing for All is through the introduction of a new Cost Rental sector, the legislative framework for which was set out in the Affordable Housing Act last year. It is a long-term rental model, in which tenants only pay the cost of providing, managing and maintaining their homes.</p>  <p>We are committed to growing this sector, and through Approved Housing Bodies, Local Authorities, and the Land Development Agency under Project Tosaigh, approximately 1,500 Cost Rental homes are targeted for completion and tenanting this year alone. Overall, some 18,000 Cost Rental homes are targeted for completion under Housing for All to 2030.</p>  <p>The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024. The Act also provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum 2 year period at a time.</p>  <p>The Act also introduced measures  to better protect tenants with affordability challenges  by  prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).</p>  <p>To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for December 2021 shows HICP inflation of 5.7% p.a.), the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 provides, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs, where the inflation rate is higher. In effect, this will mean that rents in RPZs may only increase by a maximum of 2% per annum pro rata during times of higher inflation. </p>  <p>In all cases, section 19(1) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds market rent. </p>  <p>In accordance with both the Programme for Government and Housing for All commitments, the Government has provided for Tenancies of Unlimited Duration through the Act. </p>  <p>All new tenancies created on or after 11 June 2022 will become tenancies of unlimited duration after 6 consecutive months in occupation under the tenancy, without a valid notice of termination having been served.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual local authorities. Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.</p>  <p>  While responsibility for the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis with a lead authority in place for each region.  A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  Decisions on the range of emergency accommodation services and funding required in each region are a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum. It is a matter for the management group of the consultative forum, in the first instance, to determine the homeless accommodation services required, the operation of such services and the funding required in each region.</p>  <p>Under Housing for All, the Government has committed to working to eradicate homelessness by 2030. The plan includes 18 distinct actions tailored to eliminate homelessness. These actions recognise that individuals experiencing homelessness have additional support needs and include specific measures to address these needs. These include measures to engage with and support rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of the Housing First programme, a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bed homes, and, importantly, ensuring provision of the necessary health and mental health supports required to assist homeless people with complex needs.</p>  <p>  The new Housing First National Implementation Plan 2022-2026 was published in December 2021. Under the plan, an additional 1,319 supported tenancies are to be delivered over the next five years, with specific annual targets for each region now set out in the plan. </p>  <p>Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a key priority of this Government.  Under Housing for All there are specific and costed plans to increase supply across all tenure types, including very significant commitments to social and affordable housing, with over 90,000 social homes and 36,000 affordable and 18,000 cost rental homes to be delivered by 2030. &euro;4 billion in capital is being invested annually on social and affordable housing.  This is the largest housing programme in the history of the State.</p>  <p>  Housing for All specifically provides for the establishment of a National Homeless Action Committee.  The primary objective of the Committee is to bring together key Government Departments, agencies and stakeholders to oversee the implementation of the homeless inter-agency measures committed to under Housing for All and to ensure coherence and co-ordination of homeless related services in delivering policy measures and actions.  The first meeting took place on 20 December 2021.</p>  <p>  Additionally, new guidance was issued in December 2021 to local authorities on the preparation of local Homelessness Action Plans. This guidance is to support the implementation of Housing for All, in particular, in respect of the policy provisions and actions on homelessness.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p><p>To aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the Regulations, increased Exchequer funding has been made available to local authorities since 2018 to enable them to build inspection capacity, with payments based on the number of inspections undertaken. Significant progress was made across the sector. The number of inspections more than doubled from 19,645 in 2017 to 40,728 in 2019. However, given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, pandemic restrictions have greatly impacted on inspection activity since March 2020. The number of inspections undertaken in 2020 fell to 25,703.</p><p>If a property has been found to be non-compliant with the regulations, it is a matter for the local authority to determine what action is necessary and appropriate, including the issuing of an improvement letter, the serving of improvement or prohibition notices, or further legal recourse.</p><p>The number of private rental inspections undertaken, improvement letters issued and improvement and prohibition notices served in the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and to the end Q3 2021 is set out in the table below: </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year</b></th>       <th><b>Total Rental Inspections Carried   Out</b></th>       <th><b>Total Improvement Letters and Notices*</b></th>       <th><b>Total Improvement Letters Issued</b></th>       <th><b>Total Improvement Notices Served</b></th>       <th><b>Total Prohibition Notices Served</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>28,464</td>       <td>6,644</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>99</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>40,728</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>17,701</td>       <td>1,911</td>       <td>106</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>25,703</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>15,033</td>       <td>1,578</td>       <td>57</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>to Q3 2021</td>       <td>11,731</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>8,199</td>       <td>359</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* Since 2019 local authorities have supplied the Department with separate figures for Improvement Letters and Improvement Notices </p><p>Detailed information in relation to the number of inspections and enforcement actions undertaken in Q4 2021 is currently being collated by my Department and full-year data for 2021 will be available on the Department's website in due course at:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/da3fe-private-housing-market-statistics/.</p></reply>

Despite pandemic-related disruptions throughout last year, the Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issued within one business day. The Passport Service expects a high level of demand for passports to continue throughout this year and has put several measures in place to meet this anticipated demand, including the assignment of additional staff.  </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports for children. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications, the processing time is 40 working days.</p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:</p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p>  <p>  The aforementioned passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provide all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport. Passport Service figures show that 45% of current applications are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. </p>  <p>  There are currently 30,000 first time child applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, almost 13,000 or 43% are incomplete applications that require additional documentation from the applicants&rsquo; guardians in order to complete the application and ensure that the child&rsquo;s passport can be issued.</p>  <p>  I urge parents of first time applicants to apply online for their children&rsquo;s passports in plenty of time, and all applicants to check the validity of passports before making flight bookings. The Emergency Passport service is available in cases of medical emergency or death of a family member abroad. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. In addition, my Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels. Over 180 additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service in January alone and further staff will be assigned in February.  I am confident that the additional staff currently being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for first time and renewal passports in 2022.</p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

The Bill was passed in the House of Commons and is now in the House of Lords, with Committee stage due to commence on 27 January.</p><p>As noted previously, this Bill as currently drafted would provide that the UK&rsquo;s immigration rules may require that specified categories of individual, to be set down in the rules, have an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) in order to travel to the UK. This may include journeys across the land border on the island of Ireland. </p><p>It is understood that, while the Bill provides that such a requirement may be introduced, any such requirement would be introduced by way of future amendments to the UK&rsquo;s immigration rules. In addition, the said Bill provides that the proposed ETA system will not apply to Irish or British citizens and the British Government has made clear that there will continue to be no immigration checks on the land border. The British Government has stated that the requirement will be in place by the end of 2024, although this timeframe could be subject to change.</p><p>Senior officials in my Department are engaging with the British Government regarding our concerns on the proposed requirement. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the movement of people on the island &ndash; the way lives are lived and business is conducted, particularly in areas contiguous to the land border &ndash; is uniquely fluid and dynamic. Tens of thousands of people &ndash; including many non-Irish and non-British nationals living here &ndash; cross the land border every day as they go about their lives &ndash; for business, visiting friends and family, studying, shopping, and socialising. It is a uniquely shared space. </p><p>There are also important considerations to be taken into account in terms of integrated supply chains and for North-South cooperation in areas such as tourism, health, and education, among others, should this proposed legislation impact on any cross-border movements for non-Irish and non-British nationals. </p><p>Further details on the proposed UK ETA scheme will emerge as the legislative process progresses and when new immigration rules are adopted. The Bill remains under consideration within the British Parliament. For our part, the Government will continue to engage with the British Government to ensure that our concerns are clearly understood.</p></reply>
