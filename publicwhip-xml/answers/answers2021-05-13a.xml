    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-13a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300064#WRA00600"><p>My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is maintained to the greatest extent possible. This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. </p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms such as Defence Forces vehicle fleet. The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and for two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 situation.  No decisions have been made for the acquisition of additional aircraft in other roles.  Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of these enhanced capabilities.  </p>  <p>  While the option of acquiring a wider military lift capability has been mentioned, it is not identified as an action for acquisition in the present 5 year Equipment Development Plan, which was developed through a joint civil-military approach.   Much of this longer range lift capability for military purposes is provided by way of chartering aircraft through a competitive procurement process on an as-required basis.  To date, this has been considered to be the most cost effective approach taking account of the acquisition, running and maintenance costs of larger aircraft in the context of their expected usage and contingency requirements.  The overall priorities in the EDP will remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability.</p>  <p>  With regard to domestic duties, while the Defence Forces are not a primary response agency for non-security related emergencies, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in an Aid to Civil Authority (ATCA) role. </p>  <p>  As part of the Defence Organisation, the Air Corps provides a broad range of services in accordance with its primary security role.  The Air Corps also undertakes a diverse range of non-security-related tasks on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis including the provision of air ambulance services to the Health Service Executive (HSE).    This support is underpinned by agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).</p>  <p>  In relation to other requests for support, the Air Corps and indeed the Defence Forces, can be made and are made available, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.  </p>  <p>  Given the unique situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, an additional PC-12 NG aircraft was purchased to provide immediate additional fixed wing capacity. This aircraft provides the Air Corps with a further agile resource to service urgent requests from the HSE and other agencies of the State. Over the last year, the Air Corps have been involved in the transportation of COVID-19 tests to Germany in direct support of the effort to fight COVID-19, as well as fulfilling a broad range of other security and non-security roles as detailed above.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-13a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300064#WRA01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 17 together.</p>  <p>  The military authorities have advised that, as at 31st March 2021, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, was 8,524 personnel. The Government remains committed to returning to, and maintaining the agreed strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel as set out in the White Paper on Defence (2015).  There are a number of factors, many of which are hard to predict, which will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.</p>  <p>  I have acknowledged that there are on-going difficulties in the Defence Forces, and these have been well-documented in the Air Corps and Naval Service. A sea-going service commitment scheme and a tax credit, both for sea-going Naval Service personnel, are examples of targeted measures I have introduced. These are aimed at retaining experienced personnel. This follows the reintroduction of a successful service commitment scheme for Flying Officers in the Air Corps.</p>  <p>Recruitment is ongoing and has resulted in 149 personnel being inducted as at 30 April 2021 and further inductions are planned.  General Service recruitment continues and the Cadet competition was launched recently.  The Air Corps Apprentice competition, closed in March 2021, attracted 663 applications and these are currently being processed. </p>  <p>  Further initiatives, that also play a role in restoring capacity and in boosting specialist&rsquo;s numbers, include:</p>  <p>  The campaign to re-enlist and re-commission former members of the Permanent Defence Force.  This campaign has resulted in 15 re-commissioning officers and 42 re-enlisting personnel being inducted in 2020 and 1 officer and 14 re-enlisting personnel being inducted in 2021 as at 30th April. </p>  <p>  Along with direct entry provision for Doctors, direct entry is also currently utilised in the Naval Service for the recruitment of specialists with further competitions being progressed.   For these Naval Service specialties, sanction has been received to provide for direct entry at a higher point on the salary scale where previous earnings indicate earnings in excess of the first point on the scale.   </p>  <p>  A key measure to address recruitment and retention challenges is the implementation of the report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  This report contained a range of pay and non-pay measures. Some recommendations were applied immediately while others were progressed through a series of projects, most of which are implemented and the others are nearing finalisation.  The Defence Forces have also benefited from pay increases under successive Public Sector Pay Agreements. Other measures are being considered in the context of the new public sector pay agreement. </p>  <p>  A Commission on the Defence Forces has also been tasked with examining a range of issues and this work is underway. On completion of the work of the Commission, I will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body for the PDF, reflecting the unique nature of military service in the context of the public service.</p>  <p>  Increasing the capacity of the Defence Forces will take time. However, I can assure the Deputy that the challenges are being addressed and work in this regard is a priority for civil and military management and myself. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-13a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300064#WRA01500"><p>The Naval Service is the State's principal sea-going agency tasked with a variety of defence and other roles.  While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks such as search and rescue, diving operations, drugs interdiction as well as many more.</p>  <p>  In relation to its sea-fishery protection role, the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 established the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) as the competent Authority for securing efficient and effective enforcement of sea fisheries protection legislation and the sustainable exploitation of marine fish resources from the waters around Ireland within Ireland's EEZ.</p>  <p>   A Service Level Agreement is in place which underpins the relationship between the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Defence Organisation.  This Agreement provides for the development of a Control Plan and for agreed reporting and training arrangements.  The agreement also provides a forum for sharing information between parties and for dealing with fisheries' control and enforcement issues.  Department officials, members of the Naval Service and the Air Corps, meet with officials of the SFPA at formal and informal meetings regularly. </p>  <p>  During 2020, the Naval Service carried out 781 fishery patrol days. Up until 30 April 2021 the Naval Service had carried out 275 fishery patrol days. Notwithstanding some mechanical, staffing and Covid issues  being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations.</p></reply>

The purpose of the review, in the context of the agreement, was to rationalise existing technical pay arrangements and consider if the requirements could be met in a more cost effective manner. A review of Technical Pay Group 1 was conducted in 2014 and came into effect at the beginning of 2015. </p>  <p>  While the review of Technical Grades 2-6 was underway, the recommendation from the Public Service Pay Commission relating to the review which related to retention of personnel, was substantially different to the focus of the original review. The Public Service Pay Commission recommended that the review of Technical Pay Groups 2 - 6, be completed at the earliest opportunity, without compromising the Public Service Stability Agreement.</p>  <p>  An initial report (October 2019) and final report (January 2020) were completed. The approach to implementing the findings of the review of Technical Grades 2-6 remains under consideration. My Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to finalising this matter.</p></reply>

I remain committed to restoring the strength of the Permanent Defence Force to 9,500 personnel and there are positive developments which are restoring capacity in certain areas which were previously significantly depleted. However, further work is required.</p><p>Recruitment is ongoing and has resulted in 149 personnel being inducted as at 30 April 2021 and further inductions are planned.  General Service recruitment continues and the 2021 Cadet competition has recently launched.  The Air Corps Apprentice competition, closed in March 2021, attracted 663 applications and these are currently being processed. </p><p>There has been significant progress in pay within the Defence Forces arising from the Public Service Pay Commission recommendations and the benefits of recent pay agreements. A new pay agreement provides an opportunity for further increases should it be accepted by the Permanent Defence Forces Representative Associations. A range of non-pay measures, aimed at attracting people into and making a career in the Defence Forces more attractive, have also been progressed.</p><p>A Commission on the Defence Forces has also been established to examine a range of matters relating to the Defence Forces, and I am aware that the Commission is consulting widely.

My Department was not involved in the decision to discontinue its use as a Post Office. </p>  <p>  As this building is within an active military installation, its long term use will be determined first and foremost by the military authorities. The future use and any associated refurbishment works for this building will be determined by the long term use it is to be put to. My Department and the military authorities will of course be guided by the County Council in terms of any works required to safeguard the architectural importance of the building.  This collaborative approach has worked very successfully with Dublin City and Cork County Councils in relation to major renovation projects for historical important buildings in McKee Barracks and Block 8 on Haulbowline Island. Any future building project will be incorporated into the Defence Forces Built Infrastructure Plan.</p></reply>

This follows the reintroduction of a successful service commitment scheme for Flying Officers in the Air Corps.</p>  <p>Recruitment is ongoing and has resulted in 149 personnel being inducted as at 30 April 2021 and further inductions are planned.  General Service recruitment continues and the Cadet competition was launched recently.  The Air Corps Apprentice competition, closed in March 2021, attracted 663 applications and these are currently being processed. </p>  <p>  Further initiatives, that also play a role in restoring capacity and in boosting specialist&rsquo;s numbers, include:</p>  <p>  The campaign to re-enlist and re-commission  former members of the Permanent Defence Force.  This campaign has resulted in 15 re-commissioning officers and 42 re-enlisting personnel being inducted in 2020 and 1 re-commissioning officer and 14 re-enlisting personnel being inducted  in 2021 as at 30th April.  Along with direct entry provision for Doctors, direct entry is also currently utilised in the Naval Service for the recruitment of specialists with further competitions being progressed. For these Naval Service specialties, sanction has been received to provide for direct entry at a higher point on the salary scale where previous earnings indicate earnings in excess of the first point on the scale.  </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress on pay within the Defence Forces arising from the Public Service Pay Commission recommendations and increases from recent pay agreements. A new pay agreement provides an opportunity for further increases, should it be accepted by the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations.</p>  <p>  A Commission on the Defence Forces has also been established to examine a range of matters relating to the Defence Forces and are consulting widely. I look forward to receiving their recommendations in due course.</p></reply>

It has been a topic at previous EU meetings at ministerial level.</p>  <p>  During discussions on the Sahel, I foregrounded Ireland&rsquo;s stabilisation efforts on the ground in Mali, both through our peacekeeping contribution to MINUSMA and with the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM). I also emphasised that Ireland&rsquo;s focus on embedding with larger Member States is a good template which allows us to make a significant commitment to a wider range of peacekeeping operations.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Strategic Compass, I reiterated Ireland's belief in the continued need for consensus in relation to CSDP decision making and the desirability of avoiding any general use of the constructive abstention provisions of the treaties.  Consensus which supports unanimity of decision making promotes greater solidarity across the Union as a whole.  I also drew attention to the importance of the force generation process in ensuring the EU is capable of fulfilling its military missions and operations.  </p>  <p>  The informal working lunch with the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg presented EU Ministers of Defence with an opportunity to engage on the topic of cooperation in theatres with partners such as NATO. The primary focus was on areas of mutual interest such as the Western Balkans and the Central Mediterranean. Ireland currently has four Defence Forces personnel deployed with EUFOR Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina and three with EUNAVFOR MED Operation IRINI. </p>  <p>  EU Ministers of Defence also endorsed the recently agreed Council Conclusions on Security and Defence in advance of their formal adoption by Foreign Affairs Ministers, and approved three Council Decisions relating to the participation of Norway, Canada and the United States in the PESCO project on Military Mobility. </p>  <p>  In advance of the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Defence Ministers&rsquo; configuration I attended the EDA Steering Board and following that I attended the EU Satellite Centre (SatCen) Ministerial Board Meeting.</p></reply>

These unacceptable forms of behaviour are not tolerated in the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I urge anyone who has any complaint which they think constitutes a criminal offence to report their concerns to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. A serving member of the Defence Forces could report such matters via the chain of command or the military police.</p>  <p>  Over quite a number of years, there have been positive and welcome developments within the Permanent Defence Force to address inappropriate behaviour. There is now a robust system in place including a regulatory framework for dealing with such matters for serving members of the Defence Forces in both a formal and informal way.  Administrative Instruction A7, Chapter 1 sets out the Defence Forces policy and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces including sexual harassment, harassment and bullying.   </p>  <p>  From time to time matters pertaining to allegations of sexual abuse are brought to my attention and I treat these with the utmost importance from the point of view of both the complainant and of those accused of wrongdoing who must have their right to fair procedures protected. The Garda&iacute; have the power, expertise and skills to treat all of those in this process with dignity and respect and especially those who come forward with traumatic detail. </p>  <p>  The Chief of Staff has provided me with a report to help inform me regarding matters raised recently in the print and broadcast media and I am considering it. I am all too aware that the history of many institutions including those of the State in regard to sexual offences is not a proud one. Nevertheless, at this point in time, it is my opinion that I do not have a verified persuasive body of evidence in relation to the Defence Forces as a place of work that warrants the establishment of an inquiry.  All current complaints are with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who are the competent authority in the State to deal with such matters.</p>  <p>  Current laws and Defence Force Regulations along with a supportive workplace culture help to minimise the occurrence of such abhorrent behaviour and increase the likelihood that such offenders will be held accountable.</p></reply>

It is of course also the case that in addition to basic pay and military service allowance, certain positions in the Defence Forces also attract specialist and technical pay and that a range of duties also attract additional allowances. These duty based allowances are not analogous to overtime as such payments are in addition to basic pay and MSA and are related to the duties undertaken. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware a Commission on the Defence Forces has been established and is currently working to meet its terms of reference. As part of its Terms of Reference the Commission will examine the evolution of all remuneration systems and structures currently in place in the Defence Forces noting what the Programme for Government states in relation to a future Permanent Pay Review Body. Upon completion of the Commission&rsquo;s work, the Minister for Defence will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body, reflecting the unique nature of military service in the context of the public service. All recommendations by the Commission or the successor body and their implementation must be consistent with national public sector wage policy</p>  <p>  I look forward to the Commissions Report, expected at the end of this year.</p></reply>

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response. It has the authority to draw together, in a joint manner, the contribution of all of the elements of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, Reserve, etc. This was provided for in a Defence Forces Regulation signed by and under the authority of the Minister for Defence.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Joint Task Force is based in McKee Barracks and its priority from the beginning has been to provide support to the HSE, while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.  </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces has provided a wide range of supports to the HSE, as coordinated by the Joint Task Force as part of the national response to Covid 19.  As the vaccine programme is rolled out the main effort and focus of Defence Forces assistance to the HSE has shifted from test and trace supports to the national vaccination programme and to supporting the mandatory hotel quarantine system.</p>  <p>  In terms of the national vaccination programme, the Defence Forces are represented on the High Level Task Force for Covid-19 Vaccination, providing planning advice and staffing support to the Vaccine Supply Chain and Logistics work stream.  </p>  <p>  At the present time, the Defence Forces deploy approximately 75 personnel on a daily basis to support the HSE National Vaccination Programme.   This support includes the provision of vaccinators through Defence Forces medical staff (Doctors, Advanced Paramedics, Paramedics and Emergency Medical Technicians). This also includes Defence Forces personnel providing assistance across 9 vaccination sites in the area of site management, administrative and logistical support. </p>  <p>  In addition through the Joint Task Force, the Defence Forces continues to support the rollout of the vaccination programme through secure storage supports; transportation of vaccinators in adverse weather conditions; transportation of vaccines, consumables and vaccinators by air at the request of the National  Ambulance Service.</p></reply>

The terms and rules of the Single Scheme &ndash; which are fundamentally different to previous superannuation public service arrangements &ndash; make no provision for the concept or award of &lsquo;supplementary pensions&rsquo; for any new entrants joining any public service group from 1 January 2013 onwards.  </p>  <p>  I have not had discussions with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the question of using the provisions of section 15 of the 2012 Act to address the matter of &lsquo;supplementary pensions&rsquo;.  Under the 2012 Act, overall statutory responsibility for the Single Scheme pension terms and conditions comes under the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the appropriateness or otherwise of the application of that particular provision would of course be a matter for that Minister and his Department.</p>  <p>  I understand that the situation regarding &lsquo;supplementary pensions&rsquo; has previously been confirmed by the Official Side, which includes the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to the Defence Forces Representative Associations.  They were advised by DPER officials in October 2017 that &ndash; given the overriding policy and fiscal objectives of the Single Scheme &ndash; there were no plans to provide for the supplementary pension concept in that Scheme.   </p>  <p>  Since then, the issue has of course featured very prominently in discussions under the established machinery between the Official Side and the Representative Side.  This includes discussions at the Defence Forces Conciliation Council, at the negotiations on the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-20, in RACO&rsquo;s submissions to the Public Service Pay Commission, and again in RACO&rsquo;s recent submission to the Commission on the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>The then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, met with RACO in September 2019 and the matter was discussed. Later, at the 2019 RACO Annual Delegate Conference, the then Minister with responsibility for Defence advised RACO that he had arranged with the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for officials to meet with RACO to discuss this matter in early 2020.  Due to unforeseen circumstances including Covid-19, the meeting did not take place until 30th   September 2020. At that meeting, I understand the DPER officials re-stated their Department&rsquo;s position that supplementary pensions are inconsistent with the terms of the Single Pension Scheme Act 2012; and that there are no plans to review the Act.</p></reply>

These provisions also need to be woven into the existing Defence Act in the appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  My officials are engaging closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to finalise the legal text of the Report Stage amendments.

I assume the Deputy is referring to the MONUSCO mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. </p>  <p>  As part of its response to the global Covid pandemic, the United Nations Secretary General in April 2020, directed the suspension of all rotations and leave for military personnel serving in United Nations missions until 30 June 2020.  The UN direction impacted over 100,000 UN uniformed personnel from over 120 countries serving world-wide, including Ireland and Defence Forces personnel serving with UN missions. The suspension was based on the protection of local communities as well as that of the peacekeepers during the Covid pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Two Defence Force personnel serving in the MONUSCO mission were due to complete their 6 months deployments in March/mid-April but were extended within the mission by a further month.  This then brought them into the period when the UN suspended rotations in all UN missions due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The rotation of these personnel was further extended at mission level by a further three months.</p>  <p>  As the deployment of the personnel to a sub-Saharan African country had been extended beyond their initial six month deployment, there was a requirement to extract them to allow for a national medical assessment of the officers. The officers in question returned to Ireland on Sunday, 31 May by commercial means. </p>  <p>  This matter has been the subject of a number of recent FOI and media queries.  An  examination of the background documentation shows attempts to extract our personnel in a very dynamic and complex situation with changing diplomatic, medical, overflight, access and UN restrictions.  Records  released appropriately as part of FOI requests revealed  some, but not all military information and advice.  As a result any inference from comments in the documents released do not relay the full extent of the situation.</p></reply>

In that regard, it is similar to other EU industry and research support programmes, such as Horizon 2020 also funded from the MFF.   </p>  <p>  The EDF provides a financial mechanism designed to enable and accelerate cooperation among Member States to better coordinate, supplement and amplify national investments in defence. Through the co-funded European Defence Fund, Member States will be able to achieve greater output and develop defence technology and equipment that may not be feasible on their own, by pooling national resources.  The Fund will also foster innovation and allow economies of scale, which will enhance the competitiveness of the EU defence industry.  </p>  <p>The Regulation establishing the European Defence Fund  was adopted on the 29 April 2021. In relation to transparency on funding allocation this is fully explained in Chapter III of the Regulation "Eligibility Conditions, Award Criteria and Financing".  Participation in the EDF does not broker any consideration or obligation in respect of a common or mutual defence commitment or participation in a military defence alliance.  As such, participation in the EDF will not compromise Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. </p>  <p>  The Fund will be divided into two windows, which are complementary - the Research Window and the Capability Window. As part of the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 a final budget which translates into a current value of just under &euro;8 billion was agreed in July 2020. It will be split between a research budget of &euro;2.651 billion, and a capability budget of &euro;5,302 billion.  EU Budget revenue is general, and is not assigned to any particular fund. As such, the European Defence Fund (EDF) does not have a defined cost to the Exchequer; rather, Ireland&rsquo;s contributions go into the general pool of revenue that funds all EU budget expenditure, including the EDF.  The EDF is encompassed within the funding being provided for the MFF which is funded directly by the Exchequer.  As such, no charge arises for my Department's Vote as a result of the establishment of the EDF.   </p>  <p>  My Department attends the EDF Expert Group Meetings, which will shortly progress to the Programme Committee Group meetings now that the Regulation has been adopted.  We have also worked with a number of like-minded EU Member States to ensure that optimal conditions exist within the instrument for national SMEs to avail of funding.  </p>  <p>  My Department has no role in administering the EDF; that is the function of the EU Commission's Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space (DEFIS).</p></reply>

The meeting was held back-to-back with a Foreign Affairs Council (Defence) meeting.  The only agenda item for the EDA meeting was a discussion on the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD).  </p>  <p>  The meeting was chaired by Head of Agency/High Representative, Josep Borrell.  In addition to Ministers for Defence, other attendees included Mr Jir&iacute; &Scaron;ediv&yacute;, EDA Chief Executive, General Claudio Graziano, Chair of European Union Military Staff, and EU Commissioner Thierry Breton.  The purpose of the meeting was to inform on the first steps taken and on the way ahead regarding the implementation of the 2020 CARD recommendations in the areas of defence spending, defence planning and defence cooperation.</p>  <p>  CARD is a process within the EU where Member States exchange data on future plans in relation to defence policy, capability development, budgets and investment.  The process aims to create greater transparency through sharing information on defence plans and thus facilitating opportunities for greater collaboration among member States on defence capability development, investment and procurement.  The objective of CARD is to review the participating member States defence activities in order to provide, over time, a comprehensive picture of the European defence landscape, which includes capability development, Research &amp;Technology efforts, the defence industrial dimension, and operational aspects. Potential benefits include more focused spending, cost sharing and greater interoperability.</p>  <p>  The first full CARD Cycle was completed  in 2020 and the CARD report was presented to Defence Ministers in November 2020.  The Report makes recommendations across defence planning, defence spending, defence cooperation, and on the fulfilment of the EU CSDP level of ambition and operational dimension.  </p>  <p>  The focus of the EDA meeting on the 6th May was on defence cooperation.  The CARD Report identifies a total of 55 collaborative opportunities throughout the whole capability spectrum, considered to be the most promising, most needed or most pressing ones, also in terms of operational value. The report recommends Member States should concentrate their collaborative capability development efforts on &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; capabilities in six focus areas &ndash; Main Battle Tank; European Patrol Class Surface Ship; Soldier Systems; Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS); Defence in Space; and Enhanced Military Mobility.  While not all focus areas are of interest or applicable to Ireland, those which are of interest are (1) European Patrol Class Surface Ship; (2) Soldier Systems and (3) Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) . </p>  <p>  During the Steering Board meeting Members States voiced their support for CARD and welcomed the work done to date. Member States also stressed a need to be realistic and clear in relation to how quickly Member States can implement the CARD recommendations into their military planning, a position which I would also support. Each Member State will need time to embed the CARD initiative within its own defence planning structures and procedures.  </p>  <p>  As the purpose of the meeting was to inform and discuss there were no decisions made or adopted.</p></reply>

They are bound by the conditions of their General Authorisation which includes the condition to take all measures necessary to ensure the security of Public Electronic Communications Networks against unauthorised access, as well as to comply with all applicable national and EU legislation regarding personal data and privacy protection. </p>  <p>  Under Regulation 23 of SI 333 of 2011 (Framework Regulations), undertakings providing public communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and services. In particular, measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users and interconnected networks.  Networks in this context can include subsea cables.  This legislation is to be updated in the context of both the transposition of the European Electronic Communications Code, as well as the proposed revised Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (the NIS 2 Directive).  Recital 51 of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposed NIS 2 Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the EU states that submarine communications cables are to have appropriate cybersecurity measures in place. In that respect, the obligation on undertakings will continue under the new legislative framework. </p>  <p>  As part of the development of the 2015 White Paper on Defence, the Department engaged in a broad-ranging consultation process, including with all other Departments. At that time the Department of the Communications, Energy and Natural Resources outlined that resilience is built into the system to mitigate against any damage to submarine cables. High capacity and multiple routes provide resilience in the event of route failure.  Business Continuity Planning is of interest to all major international corporations. Where damage has occurred to a cable in the past, the operators have shared a cable while repairs are made.  Under the National Cyber Security Strategy, an updated detailed risk assessment of the vulnerability of all Critical National Infrastructure and services to cyberattack is being performed.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are aware of active subsea fibre optic cables landing on the island of Ireland. While these may present strategic locations for marine counter terrorism, the locations and security of these telecommunication resources does not rest with the Defence Forces. As any threat to these installations would be considered an on-island domestic security matter the responsibility rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

Where a school does not form a cluster with another school, the school will apply to the Department to have these hours recorded on the Online Claims System (OLCS) as part-time Special Education Teaching hours.  Schools can then choose to utilise these hours to employ a teacher for a specified period towards the end of the year. </p>  <p>  The current position is that there are 22,415 part-time Special Education Teacher (SET) hours which is the equivalent of 24.5 full-time teaching posts remaining on the OLCS to be utilised by 201 schools in the primary school sector in the current school year.  </p>  <p>  Some schools bank their hours to be used and employ a teacher toward the end of the year.

In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  </p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held and formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the new national training programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new training programme for SNAs now in place is of high quality and will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

The numbers of teacher in special education and special needs assistants (SNAs) are at unprecedented levels in 2021.

My Department is not aware of evidence indicating difficulty in filling the new teacher or SNA posts coming on stream.</p><p>The SNA scheme provides mainstream primary, post primary and special schools with additional adult support staff to assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs to attend school.  </p><p>SNAs are recruited specifically to assist schools in providing the necessary non&ndash;teaching services to pupils with additional and significant care needs. The role of the SNA is to support the classroom teacher and special education teachers, and to assist in the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context.</p><p>Teachers and SNAs work across the full special education continuum spanning, mainstream classes, special classes and special schools.</p><p>There are currently over 17,000 SNA posts allocated to primary, post primary and special schools.

NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p>  <p>  NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p>  <p>  Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p>  <p>  Through ongoing consultation at local level the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work at local level to identify any and all relevant suitable placements. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is working with a significant number of schools in the county to encourage and support the opening of new special classes at all levels. The NCSE has specific plans in place to open a number of additional classes in schools in North Dublin. </p>  <p>  I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

Written submissions were also invited from education partners in June 2015 and were published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The Report on the Review of DEIS was subsequently published in 2017.</p>  <p>  From this consultation process, and as outlined in the DEIS Plan, it was clear that schools wanted a change to the DEIS identification process which would reduce the administration burden on school principals and there was a demand for a more responsive methodology. This feedback, together with the availability of the Pobal HP deprivation index and school data sources through pupil enrolment databases (POD and PPOD) facilitated the Department move to develop a new objective, statistics based model. </p>  <p>  In 2017, as a proof of concept of the model, an additional 79 schools were added who were assessed as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage were brought into the DEIS programme using this model, with a further 30 being upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status at that time. This additionality to the DEIS Programme came into effect from September 2017. </p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan acknowledged that further work was required to refine the model and my Department is undertaking an extensive body of work in relation to this. As part of the process when there is a roll out of any changed or a new model, my Department engages with the education partners to ensure that there is a clear understanding across the system and that the process is clear, open, transparent and easily understood. As part of the refinement of the model my Department commenced a consultation process with the education partners, (i.e. school management bodies, and unions and the national parents council representative bodies) on the technical aspects and implementation of the model and further work on the model is being progressed. Work on refinement of the model is ongoing and until this work is complete it is not intended to extend DEIS to further schools.</p></reply>

In 2017, my Department issued a circular letter to schools on school uniform costs and other school costs. The circular requires schools to adopt a range of measures to reduce the cost of school uniforms. These include ensuring that all elements of a school uniform are purchasable from a number of stores. The circular also requires schools to consult with parents on the school uniform policy and cost reduction initiatives.</p>  <p>  Regarding school books, the most recent figures available indicate that 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme.   &euro;17.1m was provided last year to provide assistance for books including Book Rental Schemes in primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  As part of the &euro;210m investment programme underpinning the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools,  my Department provided &euro;100m in grant funding to schools to address their ICT needs during 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions. This can include the purchase of ICT devices including laptops, tablet devices and hybrid computing devices, essential learning platforms and other ICT infrastructure to support the provision of remote learning. </p>  <p>  I understand the need for improved capitation funding and I am pleased that budget 2020 has been able to provide for a further 2.5% increase in standard capitation funding for primary schools that applied from the start of the 2020/21 school year. This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in budget 2019.</p>  <p>  The combined increases given in 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration will be achieved. </p>  <p>  All schools have received the benefit of the capitation increases awarded to date. It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets.</p></reply>

This school was established in 2019 under the patronage of Educate Together.</p>  <p>  Agreement in principle has been reached to acquire a site for the permanent location of the school referred to. This agreement is subject to contract, conveyancing and satisfactory grant of full planning permission. The location of the permanent site (circa 11 acres in size) will incorporate the current temporary site at Mill Road, Drogheda at which the school is located.</p>  <p>  The school building project will be delivered under my Department's Design and Build programme.  The project will proceed into early architectural planning which involves site surveys, school design stages and the preparation of statutory applications.  A pre planning meeting will be arranged with the local authority in advance of preparing a Planning Application.  Once statutory approvals have been secured, the project will proceed to tender and construction stages. </p>  <p>  In addition, the following projects are included on my Department&rsquo;s School Building Programme:</p>  <p>1.  Scoil Ui Mhuiri Dunleer, this project has been recently completed and will increase capacity to accommodate 750 pupils.</p>  <p>2.  Bush Post-Primary School, this project to increase capacity to accommodate 700/750 pupils is currently at tender stage. </p>  <p>  Details of projects ongoing or recently completed are update regularly on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p>  <p>  In relation to Irish-medium education, as the Deputy may be aware, I recently approved a proposal by An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta (AFP) for a pilot in Dundalk to develop a satellite model whereby an existing AFP Gaelchol&aacute;iste (Col&aacute;iste Ghl&oacute;r na Mara, Balbriggan) will expand to provide Irish-medium education from a campus in Dundalk. Piloting the Irish-medium satellite model provides an opportunity to explore a model which could have strategic benefits and applicability elsewhere in the country in particular circumstances. The Department is also continuing to support the existing Aonad at Col&aacute;iste Ch&uacute; Chulainn, Dundalk, to ensure continuity of provision for the students enrolled.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan sets out the vision for interventions in the critical area of educational disadvantage policy and is based on the findings of an extensive review of the DEIS programme, which involved consultations with all relevant stakeholders.</p><p>In the 2020/21 school year the DEIS programme will support over 185,000 pupils across 887 schools (689 primary and 198 post primary). This represents in the region of 20% of the overall school population and includes 79 schools, who had the highest concentrated levels of disadvantage, who were added to the DEIS Programme for the first time from September 2017. </p><p>My Department will spend over &euro;150million on supports for schools under the DEIS programme in 2021, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP). This also includes in the region of &euro;16.2 million which will be provided to schools in the form of a DEIS grant for the 2021/22 school year. In March I announced an improvement in the staffing threshold for all DEIS Urban Band 1 schools. I also announced an increase in the budget of the School Completion Programme and a reduction in the enrolment threshold for the allocation of an additional deputy principal in DEIS post-primary schools, from 700 to 600 students. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s investment in 2021 also includes providing for;</p><p>419 Home School Community Liaison Coordinators serving 539 schools, catering for approximately 156,000 pupils. </p><p>Additional posts for DEIS Band 1 primary schools to allow for a reduced pupil teacher ratio.</p><p>Curriculum supports</p><p>Priority access to continuing professional development</p><p>Enhanced school book grants.</p><p>Evidence from the evaluation of the DEIS programme to date demonstrates that it is having a positive effect in this effect.</p><p>A wide variety of measures are underway to ensure my Department supports Traveller children in having their educational needs met.  The model for allocating Special Education Teachers in mainstream schools provides a single allocation for special educational supports based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. The model establishes a school&rsquo;s educational profile, which includes traveller children, enrolled in a school under the following strands:  </p><p>The number of students with complex special educational needs.</p><p>The social context of school which at primary level, one component includes the number of traveller pupils and at post primary schools, is based on the number of pupils who had exam fee exemptions, including Traveller pupils.</p><p>Percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised test results which includes schools with pupils from the Traveller community who may be attaining lower standardised test scores. </p><p>My Department currently spends &euro;2 billion on making additional provision for children with special educational needs. </p><p>This week I announced the provision of expanded summer education programmes for pupils with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage, as a Covid-19 pandemic response measure, for summer 2021.</p><p>Under this expansion of the summer programme, students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage will have access to an enhanced summer programme of education. The total funding available to provide the programme is up to &euro;40 million, a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.</p><p>The programme&rsquo;s aims are to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote well-being and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they can move on to their planned educational placement next September along with their peers. </p></reply>

With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. Information on school enrolments and Child Benefit data allows the Department to map where children are living or attending school and this information provides a degree of certainty in projecting demand in an area in future years.</p>  <p>  Three initiatives have been introduced recently to strengthen the demographic analysis process.</p>  <p>   The first involves enhancing our engagement with local authorities in relation to the      information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process.</p>  <p>  The second involves the Department having additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements. Education and Training Boards, Diocesan Offices, and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, an Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can be an important source of local knowledge.</p>  <p>  The third involves the Department putting a structure and system in place for a national      inventory of school capacity to be completed by individual schools. When schools are providing their annual 30 September enrolment returns to the Department in respect of the Primary On-line Database (POD) for primary schools and Post-Primary On-line Database (PPOD) for post-primary  schools, they are now also requested to provide information in respect of overall demand for school places and available capacity within their schools. The compilation and analysis of this information at local, regional and national level through the Department's Geographic Information System (GIS) is an important additional feature of the school planning process. 2019/20 was the first year of this initiative and the approach taken will provide a cost effective and efficient method for the provision and analysis of up to date data in relation to demand and capacity across over      3,500 primary schools and over 750 post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  While it is the policy of my Department to ensure a high standard of permanent accommodation for all schools, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population over the last decade or more it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation to meet the accommodation needs of schools. </p>  <p>  Maximising the opportunities to achieve value for money involves matching, as best as possible, the accommodation requirement with the appropriate permanent or temporary accommodation solution.  However, even where an accommodation requirement is for the long-term it may not be possible to achieve this in all cases which then triggers a requirement for an interim accommodation solution.  For example, two key factors that impact on the timeline for providing a permanent building for a new school are the identification and acquisition of a suitable site and obtaining planning permission.  While good progress has been made on providing better lead in periods for the establishment of new schools and opportunities for use of existing State or other school sites are maximised wherever possible it nevertheless remains a significant challenge to be managed.</p></reply>

This Department&rsquo;s most recent projections indicate continued increasing demand for post primary school places in East County Cork, particularly in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools;  Extending the capacity of a school or schools; Provision of a new school or schools. </p>  <p>  Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p></reply>

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; InterpretationSection 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs; Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools; Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing; Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards; Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act; Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council; Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>  The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs; consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP); the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan; an independent appeals process.</p><p>Since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.</p><p>Since my appointment as the first Minister for Special Education and Inclusion I have indicated that one of my key priorities is the reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. </p><p>A review of the Act will also take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

The circulars allow for greater flexibility in the assignment and re-assignment of roles and responsibilities to Assistant Principals. This will afford school management greater flexibility to respond to the individual needs and priorities of their school.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p><p>In October 2019, my predecessor announced a review of the school transport scheme with a view to taking a fresh look at the service and its broader effectiveness and sustainability. Given the evolving situation with Covid-19 the work of the Steering Group had been delayed. However, an initial meeting of the Steering Group was recently held in order to recommence the process which will continue over the coming period. The review is being conducted to ensure that the school transport is fit for purpose and that it serves students and their families adequately.</p><p>This review will build on the proposals in the Programme for Government as they relate to school transport, including examining the options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the School Transport Scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme;<i></i>examining the options for providing a better value and a better service for students, including and examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school.</p><p>It is planned that the Steering Group will report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report later this year with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme.</p><p>The Steering Group will report to me initially on preliminary findings regarding eligibility, before moving to consider and report on broader issues such as the objectives of the scheme and the alignment of the scheme with other initiatives and wider Government policy.  The Steering Group is due to report to me shortly with this preliminary report.</p></reply>

I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including secretaries and caretakers. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. The parties continue to engage under the auspices of the WRC and I support meaningful engagement on this issue by all parties.</p></reply>

The programme&rsquo;s aims are to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote well-being and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they can move on to their planned educational placement next September along with their peers</p><p>Further details on the programmes will be published shortly on <i>www.gov.ie/summerprovision</i>.</p><p>In terms of staffing resources, a new model for allocating Special Education Teachers to mainstream schools was introduced from September 2017, based on the profiled needs of schools.  The allocations have remained in place for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 school years, with adjustments made over the course of the model for schools which achieved developing status, or successfully appealed on the grounds of exceptional circumstances arising in their schools. Allocations are also provided for new schools which open each year.</p><p>DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019, stated that the allocations for 2019 would remain in place for a minimum of two years, following which, revised profiled allocations would be considered for schools from September 2021. The NCSE Policy advice on which the SET allocation model is based, recommended that &lsquo;the additional teaching supports be left in place for a two-year period. As the new model becomes embedded in the system, this may be extended to three years.&rsquo;</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re-profiled allocations due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: <i></i></p><p>My Department also confirmed this week that there will be no change to the model of allocation for SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.With the onset of Covid-19 and the closure of school buildings from March 2020 and the resulting disruption to schools and the system as a whole, it was decided to defer the full introduction of the Model by one year i.e. to the commencement of the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>SNA allocations for 2021/22 school year will be based on the actual number of SNAs employed by a school on 30 April 2021 and the allocation on that date will be rolled over into 2021/22. No school will receive a reduced allocation and there will be scope for additionality under an exceptional review process to be delivered by the National Council for Special Education.</p></reply>

This change is manifested in a number of special policy initiatives now underway.  Such a policy has many benefits for schools, children and parents. Central to the change is that a diagnosis of a disability is not now needed by pupils in mainstream classes to access much needed supports.  This represents 98% of children who are in need of additional supports in the schools.</p>  <p>  A new model for allocating special education teachers to mainstream schools was introduced with effect from September 2017. </p>  <p>  Under the new model, assessment, or diagnosis of a particular condition is no longer necessary for pupils to access educational teaching resources in schools, nor is there now a requirement for schools to submit assessments annually in order to apply for additional teaching resources. </p>  <p>  This has helped to end delays in allocations. Pupils need no longer experience delays in receiving reports which could, in the past, deny a child access to necessary learning supports.  </p>  <p>  Schools may allocate additional teaching support to pupils where it has identified learning needs using school based assessment or the Continuum of Support and the Guidelines provided to schools. Schools can also draw on professional reports where available. </p>  <p>  Medical and other professional assessments may continue to be used to help explain, and provide a better understanding of a child&rsquo;s needs, the nature of difficulties, and to inform relevant interventions. They are not however, a requirement for the provision of additional teaching support. </p>  <p>  Since April 2020, a child no longer requires an assessed disability to require or qualify for access to SNA (Special Needs Assistant) support. A new model for allocating SNAs to schools is also being developed. This model will also not require children to have a diagnosis of a particular disability in order to access services and assessments for individual children were not required to be submitted for the 2022/23 school year. </p>  <p>  The criteria for accessing Reasonable Accommodations at State Exams and Irish Exemptions are also now needs based and not requiring assessment of disability. </p>  <p>  Whereas an assessment of a particular disability is still a requirement for access to special schools and classes, it is not necessary that this assessment be undertaken through the Assessment of Needs (AON) process and children who receive their assessment through the AON process are not given prioritised for service. </p>  <p>  The development over the coming period of the School Inclusion Model which introduces therapy into schools will be another milestone in the change to a needs based approach.</p></reply>

Hours accumulated in any given school year must be utilised in the same school year.  </p><p>Where hours were accumulated due to a school receiving a backdated increase to their Special Education Teaching hours, or due to a Special Education Teacher being used to cover substitution, as an emergency measure, schools were advised that any loss of special education teaching time should be made up at the first available opportunity by employing additional teaching resources to make up for the shortfall.</p><p>DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools set out the details of the model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  DES Circulars 007 and 008 of 2019 set out how the allocations for schools are being updated from September 2019.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  </p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.</p><p>Under the allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link:<i></i></p></reply>

In the current school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. All children who are eligible and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport in the 2021/22 school year where such services are in operation.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis, where seats are available after all eligible applicants have been accommodated. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. Based on public health advice my Department provided for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, using 50% of passenger capacity.  My officials engage on a weekly basis with public health consultants from the HSE in relation to the safe operation of schools including school transport.</p>  <p>  The requirement to implement additional measures on school transport services in the 2021/22 school year will be dependent on the prevailing public health advice at that time. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is currently conducting a review of the School Transport Scheme.  The review is being conducted to ensure that the school transport scheme is fit for purpose and that it serves students and their families adequately. It is planned that the Steering Group will report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report later this year with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. The Steering Group will report to me initially on preliminary findings regarding eligibility, before moving to consider and report on broader issues such as the objectives of the scheme and the alignment of the scheme with other initiatives and wider government policy.  This initial report of the Steering Group is due to be completed shortly. </p></reply>

In February 2021, the Inspectorate surveyed a sample of primary pupils, including pupils attended DEIS schools, on the provision of remote teaching and learning while the schools and centres were closed. The Inspectorate also surveyed a sample of parents of pupils in primary schools in February 2021. The sample included DEIS schools. Most parents who responded agreed that their child was well supported by the school to keep up with their work. </p>  <p>  DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools is the main policy initiative of my Department of Education to address educational disadvantage at school level. My Department will spend over &euro;150million on supports for schools under the DEIS programme in 2021, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP). This also includes in the region of &euro;16.2 million which will be provided to schools in the form of a DEIS grant for the 2021/22 school year. It is a matter for each individual school to determine how best to use this funding, but it is intended to support the objectives of the DEIS programme, including retention, attendance, literacy and numeracy. In recognition of the difficulties faced by some students to engage with remote learning, at the time the grant issued last year all DEIS schools were informed by letter that they could consider using some of their DEIS funding to support pupils&rsquo; learning, for example to arrange access to additional materials of supports for students during the move to remote teaching and learning caused by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  When schools were closed, where the nature of costs which would normally have been incurred when schools were open changed, it was a matter for schools to use the resources available to the school including the DEIS grant funding allocated to support students in DEIS schools, in accordance with the needs of the school.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that my Department provides capitation funding to all recognised schools in the free education scheme. The capitation grant caters for day to day running costs of the school, including postage costs. The capitation grant has increased in the budgets of 2019 and 2020. </p></reply>

The approach is founded on research and best international practice in relation to how schools can best support the well-being and mental health of children and young people.  The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that includes providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies and providing opportunities to experience supportive relationships within the school setting and to learn through those relationships.</p>  <p>  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to well-being should be made available. Those at greater risk and with greater needs may require more specific and targeted support, in addition to the support provided at the universal level for all children and young people.</p>  <p>  A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support well-being and resilience.  This support is provided to primary and post-primary schools through a range of services and supports including the National Educational Psychological  Service (NEPS), Guidance Counselling provision at post primary level, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST).</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of counselling services in Ireland, and through HSE Primary Care Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  In addition, the HSE and its funded providers, provide e-mental health services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice.  My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  Work will continue to collectively explore ways of improving supports for children and young people. </p></reply>

Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle.

The school&rsquo;s programme for RSE is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated. </p><p>The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;  <i>this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education and Social, Personal and Health Education across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ and make appropriate legislative changes, if necessary&rsquo;</i></p><p>I am committed to this aim and my Department continues to work closely with the NCCA to best give effect to it.

New schools, including newly amalgamated schools, can appoint a Principal from 1 September in the year prior to the school opening. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).  The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.</p></reply>

With this in mind the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Small business assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. The level of business supports is unprecedented.</p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so.

However, the Government has urged landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. With this in mind, on 1st October 2020, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents. The aim of the voluntary Code is to facilitate discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. It sets out a structured approach for engagement between both commercial landlords and tenants, based on their mutual interest in continuing to work together.</p>  <p>  However, this Code should not be seen in isolation. To date, a range of supports have been developed for businesses, including the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), wage subsidies, a commercial rates holiday, low-cost loans, and a VAT reduction.</p>  <p>  As public health restrictions are eased and the economy reopens, the Government is committed to ensuring that there is no cliff edge in financial supports for businesses. As such, any business currently availing of CRSS and that can now reopen will be able to avail of double restart week payments for two weeks subject to the statutory maximum of &euro;5,000 per week to support them in meeting the costs of reopening as they exit the scheme.</p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest that small business owners contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business. Details of the Code of Conduct and the wide range of supports available for business are on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In addition, earlier this week, Minister Troy announced the General Scheme for a Small Business Administrative Rescue Process providing for a simplified restructuring process for viable small companies that is both timely and cost effective.</p>  <p>  My officials continue to monitor international developments in relation to commercial rents such as the Swedish scheme mentioned. In this scheme, firstly landlords have to agree to a rent reduction; it is not a mandatory scheme. The Government support is then provided to the landlord. It is also worth noting that in the Swedish scheme it appears that if the landlord has already previously agreed to concessions (and the tenancy agreement has been amended) this scheme is not applicable. State aid rules also apply.</p>  <p>  The question of whether Ireland should provide grants to mitigate rental costs for commercial tenants was examined last year and it was found that there may be significant risk to the Exchequer if the State undertook to provide grants to defray commercial rents as the level of financial exposure is unquantifiable compounded by lack of accurate data on rent levels. As with the Swedish model, it was also determined that any financial assistance to business (tenants) tied to rents would likely end up as support to the landlord. The offering of assistance, or even the perception that such relief would be forthcoming, could affect the market and reduce the impetus for landlords to negotiate with tenants.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can help businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.</p></reply>

The Local Enterprise Offices act as a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service for all relevant government supports available to the SME sector and can provide information/referrals to other bodies under agreed protocols such as Revenue, Micro Finance Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, LEADER, and Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (up to 10 employees) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector. Start-up businesses that have not begun trading may avail of the Local Enterprise Office feasibility grant, priming grant and all ancillary support including training, management development and mentoring subject to meeting the eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  However, the Local Enterprise Offices do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services including beauticians, local professional services or construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses.</p>  <p>  Businesses which have been trading for at least 6 months may also be applicable for the Trading Online Voucher Scheme, which offers a 50% co-funded voucher of up to &euro;2,500 (maximum value of &euro;5,000 when 50% co- funded by the applicant) to help businesses develop their online trading capability and includes training sessions that cover various topics, such as developing a website, digital marketing, social media for business and search engine optimisation.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices can also assist clients with applications to Microfinance Ireland for small business loans of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;25,000 (unsecured). Loans for commercially viable proposals can be used to help fund start-up costs, working capital or business expansion and by applying through their Local Enterprise Office, clients can avail of a 1% reduction in the interest rate charged.</p>  <p>  For those new entrepreneurs who are embarking on their business journey the Local Enterprise Offices offer a variety of soft supports such as mentoring and training programmes which enterprises can register for through their Local Enterprise Office&rsquo;s website and are delivered online with no registration fees.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices also offer the very successful Start Your Own Business programme, which guides entrepreneurs through the various aspects of business and business planning. The objective of the Start Your Own Business programme is to assist clients and new entrepreneurs in evaluating their business idea, urging them to assess its viability and help them make decisions on whether they should proceed or take a step back.</p>  <p>  I would urge anyone looking to start or grow their business to make contact with their Local Enterprise Office to enquire about the supports available to help them on their journey.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2020 is currently being finalised and is expected to be published on our website in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Report will set out, by way of an Appendix, information on the total number of contracts issued over &euro;25,000 which incorporated Green Public Procurement considerations in 2020. The Appendix will cover eight priority sectors listed in the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s 2014 Green Procurement Guidance for the Public Sector and these sectors cover Transport, Construction, Energy, Food &amp;amp; Catering Services, Cleaning Products &amp;amp; Services, Textiles, IT Equipment and Paper. It will also incorporate an &lsquo;Other&rsquo; category to cover green procurement activities not covered in the above priority sectors. It should be noted that not all of these sectors are of relevance to the procurement requirements of  my Department, its Offices and Agencies.</p>  <p>  In 2020 13 contracts with a value in excess of &euro;25,000 were issued by my Department across the priority sectors and &lsquo;Other&rsquo; category to the value of &euro;1.14 million. Of these, 4 contracts incorporated specific GPP considerations to the value of &euro;295,822. These are broken down by sector as follows:</p>  <p>  - Cleaning Products &amp;amp; Services Sector</p>  <p>  - Food &amp;amp; Catering Sector</p>  <p>  - Furniture Removal Sector</p>  <p>  - Research Study Sector </p>  <p>  My Department continues to be mindful of the need to promote the use of environmental considerations in public procurement and to consider how social issues can be appropriately integrated into the procurement process. Where possible business units of my Department, and the Offices and Agencies under its remit, use the Office of Government Procurement&rsquo;s (OGP) standard tendering and contract templates in their procurement processes. The standard template includes a requirement that the service provider comply with all applicable obligations in the field of environmental, social and labour law that apply at the place where the services are provided.</p>  <p>  A specific statement on green public procurement is also being incorporated into the Department&rsquo;s Corporate Procurement Plan for 2021.</p></reply>

These are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).   The SEAI residential retrofit schemes offer partial grants for individuals who can afford to contribute to the cost of upgrades as well as free energy efficiency improvements for people at risk of energy poverty. Since 2000, around 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.</p>  <p>  This year, &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes. This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes.</p>  <p>  Of this amount, &euro;109 million is allocated to provide free upgrades for lower income households. This is a &euro;47 million increase on the 2020 allocation. &euro;112.5 million will be spent on expanding other existing SEAI grant schemes and introducing new initiatives. The first of the new schemes was launched in September when a call for projects under the new National Retrofit (One-Stop-Shop Development) scheme issued. A &euro;30 million call for projects under the Communities Energy Grant scheme was launched in November. Further initiatives will follow in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The SEAI grant schemes focus on older homes. Grants for insulation and heating control systems are available to homes built and occupied prior to 2006. Heat pump and solar grants are available to homes built and occupied prior to 2011.</p>  <p>  Full details on the application processes for all schemes operated by the SEAI are available at www.seai.ie.</p></reply>

NBI has advised that build work is in progress in the location of the premises referred to in the Question and NBI anticipate that high speed broadband will be available in the area later this year.</p><p>In County Kerry, premises have been surveyed or are in the process of being surveyed in the townlands around Killarney, including Muckross, Fossa, Kilcummin, Lissivigeen, Ballycasheen, Faha, Firies and Ballyhar.Surveying activity is also underway or completed in Tralee, Curraheen, Abbeydorney, Kilflynn, Firies, Castlemaine, Ardfert, Rathmore, Knocknacopple, Mounthorgan, Kilquane Upper, Barraduff, Cloonteens, Gneevgullia, Tureenamult,Renasup.Castlegregory, Aughacasla, Camp, Knockbrack, Maum, Lougher, Inch, Annascaul, Derrygorman, Ballyglasheen, Brackluin, Ballintarmon, Drom, An Clochan, Kilshannig, Fahamore, Candeehy, Breanainn, Ballyheigue, Glenderry, Ladywell, Banna, Lerrig, Ballymacandrew, Causeway, Foxfort, Ballymacaquinn, Ballincloher, Dromartin and Beenconeen. Build has started in the areas around Tralee in Curraheen, Abbeydorney, Kilflynn, Firies, Castlemaine and Ardfert. Pre-build works have commenced in the Killarney area.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Kerry through the NBI website, www.nbi.ie, which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 6 May, 310 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for schools. BCP sites installed in Kerry include Gneeveguilla (Tureencahill), Cable Station, Railway Station Heritage Centre and Community Space, Inch Community Centre, Kielduff Community Centre, Chapeltown and Cill&iacute;n Liath. Further details can be found at .</p><p>Boheeshil National School, Dunloe Upper and Coars National School are installed  as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at .</p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high-speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.  Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has investigated the matter and from our records we have established that the premises should be served with high speed broadband from Fibre To The Cabinet in the area with access to download speeds of 70Mbps.</p></reply>

This will help significantly to tackle the backlog.</p>  <p>  The RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. A pilot online driver theory test is underway for trucks and buses.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector.</p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 <i>Climate Action Plan</i>, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. </p><p>To this end, my Department has convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group</i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The <i>EVPP Working Group</i>comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales. Scrappage schemes were discussed as part of these considerations. The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group are being considered at senior level and will be brought to Government shortly.</p><p>Furthermore, considerable progress has been made, as a result of the work of the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce</i>, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to around 32,000 now.</p></reply>

It contains an option to extend for a period(s) up to a further 3 years. The contract has been extended initially for one year to July 2023 to facilitate the procurement of a new service in accordance with Public Spending Code requirements and a seamless transition from one service to another.</p>  <p>  In November 2019 the Department of Transport commenced a process to prepare for the next iteration of the Coast Guard Aviation service. This involved an extensive consultation process with all key State and other SAR stakeholders to consider the scope and demand for the service over the lifetime of a new contract.</p>  <p>  An initial report was brought to Government in July last, following approval by a Steering Group of State stakeholders. This report included a strategic assessment, setting out the context for the SAR aviation programme, an organisational overview, and a survey of existing policies and strategies relevant to the programme. It identified the spending objectives of the programme, including existing arrangements and relevant business needs. It also included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including the State assuming full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or a dedicated IRCG Aviation Branch. Both were ruled out for a variety of reasons. The process is now at detailed business case stage which is focused on the remaining viable options. While it is not envisaged that the Air Corps take full responsibility for this service on the basis of that initial assessment, my Department was asked by the Department of Defence to explore the viability of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service.</p>  <p>  The Air Corps submission that the Deputy refers to was received by my Department last March and is being reviewed as part of the preparation of a detailed business case on the entire IRCG aviation service. This is part of a deliberative process which will lead to a Government decision in due course and on which it would not be appropriate for me to comment.</p>  <p>  To be clear, I have no role in the business case development. This is being led by KPMG and a Project Team which includes officials in my Department and independent expertise. The outcome of this will be brought to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  All relevant and reliable information on the current status of this project can be found on our dedicated SAR Webpage &ndash; Irish Coast Guard: Search and Rescue (SAR) Aviation Project.</p></reply>

According to energy market analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA), supply constraint measures taken by the industry, in combination with re-opening of major economies, widespread fiscal stimulus responses, as well as optimism surrounding the roll out of vaccines, has supported a rebound in demand and upward price movement in the oil market. IEA analysis also points to restricted production and increased costs in light of Covid-19 health protection measures in 2020, as well as increased demand for coal as a fuel input in power production in China and unusually cold conditions in North America and Europe in early 2021 contributing to increased retail prices in coal.</p><p>Petrol and auto diesel are subject to Mineral Oil Tax which comprises a carbon charge and a non carbon charge, as well as VAT at the standard rate and the NORA levy of 2 cents per litre. The non carbon charge and NORA levy have not been increased since 2012 and 2009 respectively. In line with this Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling climate change as set out in the Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan, Budget 2021 increased the rate of carbon tax from &euro;26 per tonne of carbon dioxide emission to &euro;33.50. The increase applied to transport fuels with effect from 14th October 2020 but I delayed its application to all other fuels until 1st May 2021 to allow for the passage of the winter heating season.  </p><p>The impact of the carbon tax increase on the most commonly used fuels is shown in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Fuel</th>       <th>Unit</th>       <th>VAT Rate</th>       <th>VAT Inclusive Impact of &euro;7.50 Carbon Tax Increase</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Petrol</td>       <td>Litre</td>       <td>23%</td>       <td>2.1 cents</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Auto Diesel</td>       <td>Litre</td>       <td>23%</td>       <td>2.5 cents</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerosene</td>       <td>Litre</td>       <td>13.5%</td>       <td>2.2 cents</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Coal</td>       <td>40KG bag</td>       <td>13.5%</td>       <td>90 cents</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Natural Gas</td>       <td>11,000 kWh*</td>       <td>13.%</td>       <td>&euro;16.94</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Average annual household usage as per the Commission for Regulation of Utilities</p><p>From September 2020 until 1<sup>st</sup>March 2021 auto fuels benefitted from a reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 23% to 21% which I announced as part of the July stimulus plan.  On the basis of March 2021 average retail auto fuel prices, the return to the 23% Standard rate of VAT comprised approximately 2 cents per litre.  According to the monthly AA Fuel Price Survey, the average retail price of both petrol and diesel increased by approximately 16 and 15 cents respectively between October 2020 and April 2021.</p><p>With reference to smokeless coal, Solid Fuel Carbon Tax legislation does not set out separate definitions and rates for &lsquo;smokeless coal&rsquo; and &lsquo;regular coal&rsquo;. I understand that distinctions between regular and smokeless coal are made in the regulatory regime for environmental standards of solid fuel that is overseen by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment which is enforced by local authorities in areas that are designated for use of certain types of solid fuel under air pollution legislation. This is a separate legal and regulatory regime and is not linked to the rates of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax, which is based on the amount of CO2 emitted by a given solid fuel product. </p><p>My advice to consumers is to shop around and if possible use price comparison websites to ensure they receive the best value for money.</p><p>If an individual believes that a breach of their consumer rights has occurred, they may make a complaint directly to the business concerned. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory independent body responsible for the promotion of consumer rights and the enforcement of consumer law. The CCPC provides advice and guidelines on the process of making a complaint. Full information is available at: www.ccpc.ie</p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;500 million have been granted to 48,900 employers in respect of 558,000 workers.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware, it was decided that the scheme is being extended until the end of June 2021. Similarly, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme is also been extended to end June 2021.</p>  <p>  Motions seeking D&aacute;il approval of the extension of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 30 June 2021 took place on Thursday 22 April, during which I reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment that there would be no cliff-edge to the economic supports at the end of June.</p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support for businesses could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable enterprises and employment and to provide firms with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.  </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that within the resources available appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

A claim may be made up to eight weeks from the date on which a claim period commences, which in most cases will be the first day on which the Covid restrictions apply to the business concerned. Where Covid restrictions continue to apply to the business beyond a period of three weeks, the eight-week time limit applies from the first day of each three-week period for which the Covid restrictions continue to apply to the business.</p><p>In order to make a claim, a business must first register for CRSS via the eRegistration system on ROS.

In some cases, the registration may not be completed within the eight-week time period for making a claim for payment under CRSS. This might arise where the registration application is made towards the end of the eight-week time limit or where Revenue requests additional information in connection with the application. In these circumstances, to ensure that a business is not adversely affected, and provided the business applies to be registered within the eight-week time period and provides the required information as part of the registration process, the business will be able to make a claim within three weeks of being registered for CRSS where this is later than the expiry of the eight-week time limit. </p><p>Also, in order to be eligible for the scheme, the person carrying on the business must hold a valid tax clearance certificate.

This particular relief was designed to encourage longer term leases of farm land, with the targeted policy objective of assisting with the mobility and productive use of agricultural land. It is not clear how the suggestion to include within the scope of the relief land leased for renewable energy projects would be consistent with the purpose of the section 664.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the introduction of any new tax expenditure measure takes place in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process. Proposals for tax expenditure measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.

Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base and a strong and convincing case for the benefits and outcomes needs to be articulated in order for due consideration to be given for the commitment of scarce taxpayer resources for such reliefs.</p></reply>

The current system already provides for a &euro;5,000 relief on VRT for electric cars valued at an open market selling price of &euro;40,000 and below, with a tapered relief up to &euro;50,000. In addition, low-emitting electric vehicles will benefit from a low VRT rate of 7%. A car scrappage scheme based on the provision of VRT relief would therefore be ineffective because no (or a much reduced rate of) VRT is paid on the registration of most Battery Electric Vehicles to begin with. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the target for the scheme would be motorists with older cars. There is unlikely to be much crossover between the population of motorists with old low-value cars and the population of motorists who might be in the market for a new, more expensive electric vehicle.</p>  <p>  For these reasons, there are currently no plans to introduce a car-scrappage scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-13a.596.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300078#WRM02200"><p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial services regulation, including for the insurance sector. It is important at the outset to state that the provision of cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies. This is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive). However, I would like to assure the Deputy that insurance reform is a key priority for the Government, and Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to play a lead role in this policy area.</p>  <p>  Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is primarily focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. Almost &euro;1 billion in flood relief measures is being invested over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027, with an expectation that insurers will provide cover where this has occurred. This approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Office of Public Works (OPW) and industry representatives Insurance Ireland. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should, in turn, provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in these areas. </p>  <p>  While there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2020, it is recognised that some householders are still experiencing difficulties. This is particularly the case for households in areas with demountable flood defences. I am conscious of the challenges that the absence or withdrawal of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses.  My officials are engaging with both Insurance Ireland, the OPW and other stakeholders regarding flood defence schemes and how the levels of insurance cover might be improved in areas where flood defence works have been completed. </p>  <p>  With regard to flood risk management in East Wall, Dublin 3, I have been advised by the OPW that the area is afforded flood protection from two flood defence schemes progressed by both it and Dublin City Council.</p>  <p>  Part of East Wall is protected by the Tolka Flood Relief Scheme. The Dublin City element of this was completed in 2008 at a cost of approximately &euro;7.5m, and protects approximately 1,345 properties. The area in question also experienced significant tidal flooding in November 2002 when the Royal Canal overtopped. This is now protected by the upgrade of Spencer Dock Sea Lock.  Dublin City Council completed the Spencer Dock Scheme in 2009 with OPW funding of &euro;3.4m protecting approximately 1,200 properties. As a result of this investment, I understand the high tide event of January 2014, which was higher than 2002, did not result in any flooding in the East Wall area.</p></reply>

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works &euro;1 billion flood relief investment programme nationally, from which the relevant funding for the Enniscorthy scheme will be made available, and on completion will protect 236 properties in the town.</p>  <p>  The Scheme requires formal confirmation from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER) to proceed. This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts (ADA), which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme. This involves, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) commissioned by WCC and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to MPER as part of the formal Confirmation process.</p>  <p>  DPER ran the statutory public consultation period required in relation to this process from July 28th to August 28th, 2020. The initial phase of the review of the EIAR and NIS was carried out by consultants engaged for this purpose by DPER, during September and early October. DPER subsequently forwarded submissions from the public consultation, and the EIAR and NIS reviews, to the OPW, along with a request for supplementary information, pursuant to ADA regulations 2019, to ensure that the design of the scheme complies with relevant environmental directives and regulations. </p>  <p>  The OPW, Wexford County Council, and scheme consultants Mott Mc Donald formally submitted their response to DPER in the final week of April 2021.  DPER and their consultants will now proceed to review the material submitted with a view to confirming the scheme. It is not possible to provide a specific timeline for a formal decision regarding confirmation in advance of that. </p>  <p>  Completion of the above tasks and the progression of the flood relief scheme is a priority for all parties. In parallel with the confirmation process, OPW and Wexford County Council have been working on the following to ensure as efficient progression of the works as possible once the scheme is confirmed &ndash; </p>  <p>  - the Foreshore licence application public consultation has been completed, approval expected mid 2021</p>  <p>  - a legal agreement with Irish Water for diversion of services has been agreed. The detailed design for these works is complete, and contractor tender documents are currently being reviewed prior to advertisement.</p>  <p>  - Technical approvals have been received from Irish Rail regarding the rail line crossings, with the legal agreement well advanced</p>  <p>  - Archaeological excavations are ongoing</p>  <p>  - Removal of invasive species (e.g. Japanese Knotweed) is ongoing</p>  <p>  - Pre-qualification of the bridgeworks contractor is almost complete, with a view to expediting contractor appointment post-confirmation</p></reply>

This has been done for example through: (a) the publication of an Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement in 2018; (b) the roll out of Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement and (c) the ongoing work of the cross-departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group chaired by the Office of Government Procurement, which is part of my Department. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s internal procurement policy sets out the policies and procedures for the procurement of goods and services by the Department and provides, among other things, that all staff involved in procurement in the Department must be fully aware of and must comply with applicable legislation and Government policies.</p><p>Among the roles of the Department's Procurement Officer is the provision of advice as and when required to staff procuring goods and services to assist them in complying with their obligations under the Department&rsquo;s procurement policy, including in respect of the application of green procurement criteria.  It should be noted in this context that the Department's own core procurement requirements mainly involve the procurement of professional services, such as business consultancy, training and advisory services, the contracts for which do not generally facilitate the inclusion of green procurement criteria.  Contracts for the procurement of products, such as the procurement of IT equipment for example, include green criteria where appropriate.</p><p>The Department's Contracts Register facilitates monitoring and reporting in relation to contracts entered into by the Department.  Work currently underway to transfer the Contracts Register to a new ICT system is expected to be completed by end June 2021 and the new system will include additional information fields, including whether or not green procurement criteria were considered applicable in respect of a contract. </p><p>The annual Corporate Procurement Plan assesses, on a whole of Department basis, the procurement arrangements that need to be put in place by the Department over a period of four years into the future, including arrangements to replace contracts that are due to expire, or have recently expired.  This annual process provides the opportunity to examine the potential, where applicable, for the aggregation of procurement activities to allow the market to be approached in a manner that would secure a more efficient outcome and maximise savings, as well as facilitating an exchange of information with the Office of Government Procurement and early engagement with it in respect of its current and planned arrangements, as well as bespoke arrangements.  Information on whether or not green procurement criteria are considered applicable in respect of the procurement processes involved will be recorded as part of the process of completing the Corporate Procurement Plan for 2021-2024.  </p><p>I can confirm that the Department&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2020 includes, at Appendix 1, the completed template in respect Green Public Procurement developed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in response to the requirements of Circular 20/2019.

Over 400 applications had been received by the closing date of 14 April.  Assessment of applications to the scheme is underway and the results will be announced shortly. LPSS 2021 builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;14m is being made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new scheme will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments:</p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers - whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply. This scheme has been developed following wide consultation with the sector.  It is hoped that the MEBAS will open for applications this month.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;5 million will be made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events. This funding will be allocated shortly.</p>  <p>  &euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector.</p>  <p>  Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021 curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations which was broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel marking the national day.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding these significant and ongoing challenges, 427 new jobs were created in Gaeltacht companies during 2020. There were 7,363 full-time and 437 part-time jobs in companies supported by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta at the end of 2020. Employment remained stable in 68% of client companies while the medical device sector saw a 4% increase in employment during 2020, with over 700 people now employed in the sector in the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta continues to work in conjunction with my Department and other state agencies such as Enterprise Ireland to ensure that Gaeltacht enterprises also have access to the broad range of targeted national and sectorial measures put in place by Government since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In this context, the Board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has approved over &euro;7.4m of supports to date for over 435 Gaeltacht companies to address financial and supply difficulties, ensure cash-flow and enhance their ability to access global online sales markets. </p>  <p>  In addition, many Gaeltacht companies operating in the tourism and hospitality sectors have accessed the range of supports for those sectors and for businesses in general which are being provided by Government since the onset of the pandemic. </p></reply>

It was also clarified that the acquisition and conveyance of freehold title had not been subject to any encumbrance, leasehold interest or title burden and that no lease of any description had been entered into in the meantime.  The acquisition was facilitated by NAMA and the consideration involved amounted to &euro;4m. This has long been a matter of public record. </p><p>Any transaction of this scale involving State bodies, by definition, engages a significant number of officials including the Minister and senior officials. It would not accord with parliamentary convention and practice to name the many personnel involved in this transaction in the Chief State Solicitor's Office, the Attorney General's Office, the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform  and NAMA. </p><p>In its recently completed final report, the Moore Street Advisory Group (MSAG) has, as one its key recommendations, endorsed the proposals put forward by the <i>Irish Heritage Trust </i>for the conservation and presentation of the national monument buildings and the creation of new visitor and reception facilities to the rear. These proposals, which will be fully considered by my Department and the Office of Public Works in determining the best solution for the national monument, are to be published on the Department&rsquo;s website, along with the MSAG report itself.</p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations. Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  </p><p>The HAP scheme is underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. Under section 41 of the 2014 Act, local authorities are required to commence the inspection process within 8 months of HAP support being provided in relation to a particular dwelling, if the dwelling was not already inspected within the previous 12 months. Local authorities carry out HAP inspections as part of their overall private rented inspections programme.</p><p>The HAP legislation provides a very structured, time bound system where serious lack of compliance exists and can result in termination of HAP payment.</p><p>Failure to comply with the minimum standards can result in penalties and prosecution. Local authorities can issue Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices to landlords who breach the minimum standards regulations. An Improvement Notice sets out the works that the landlord must carry out to remedy a breach of the regulations.</p><p>In the case of a Prohibition Notice being enforced, a local authority may provide, or continue to provide, HAP in respect of that property for a period of 13 weeks, to enable the household to find an alternative dwelling.</p><p>Local authorities report to my Department on numbers of overall inspections carried out and enforcement actions undertaken on a quarterly basis. The most recent data received in respect of the number of inspections of all private rental properties and those with HAP tenancies is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>HAP Inspections       carried out in 2019</th>       <th>Total Inspections     carried out in 2019</th>       <th>HAP On-site Inspections    carried out in 2020</th>       <th>Total On-site Inspections    carried out in 2020</th>       <th>HAP    Virtual Inspections    carried out in 2020</th>       <th>Total Virtual     Inspections carried out in 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>23,424</td>       <td>40,728</td>       <td>12,031</td>       <td>24,315</td>       <td>991</td>       <td>1,388 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted on the inspection of all rented dwellings &ndash; not just those with HAP tenancies. The City and County Management Association&rsquo;s Local Authority Resilience and Recovery Plan for living with Covid-19 (October 2020) and its subsequent Local Authority Services Framework for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response (January 2021) do not permit rental inspections in Levels 4 and 5. This is in order to protect tenants, landlords and rental inspectors.</p><p>In response to the difficulties caused by pandemic restrictions, some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections. Dublin City Council have led this initiative which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and being asked to confirm that any remedial works requested by the local authority have been completed, and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to so. </p><p>While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. I support these initiatives and my Department is encouraging local authorities not involved in the pilots to consider adopting them. I have committed to providing Exchequer funding for those that do.</p><p>Comprehensive data in respect of the number of inspections of all private rental properties, Improvement Letters and Improvement Notices issued, and the legal actions initiated by local authorities in the period 2005 to 2020 is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-13a.661.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051300079#WRN04100"><p>Local authorities have been provided with a number of powers and measures to deal with the issue of derelict properties, both in larger urban conglomerations and in smaller rural towns and villages. There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration.</p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.</p>  <p>  Local authority powers include requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. Members of the public can engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, both the Derelict Site Levy and the Vacant Site Levy increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. These levies are applied annually for as long as relevant sites remain derelict or vacant. This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development in designated areas while also combatting land hoarding.</p>  <p>  There is a number of other measures which have been introduced over recent years to assist in addressing dereliction and vacancy. The Repair and Leasing Scheme was introduced to assist property owners in bringing vacant properties back into use for social housing purposes. The scheme is particularly targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties.</p>  <p>  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs is met upfront with a capital loan from the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB) up to a maximum of &euro;60,000. This allows the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement with a local authority or an AHB for a period of time that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum lease period of 5 years. Up to end 2020, a total of 234 homes had been brought back into use under the scheme.</p>  <p>  A similar measure entitled the Buy and Renew Scheme supports local authorities in purchasing and renewing housing units in need of repair which can then be made available for social housing use. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the suitability of a property for social housing. Important considerations in this regard include the location of a property in relation to housing need and demand; the design, scale and suitability of a property for social housing use; and the costs and practicality of acquiring and remediating a property.</p>  <p>  The Buy and Renew Scheme particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.  As a complementary initiative to the Repair and Leasing Scheme, it provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners of the properties concerned. To date, local authorities delivered approximately 670 new social homes under the scheme.  Activity in this regard is largely delegated to local authorities so they can respond flexibly to all opportunities to provide new social housing.</p>  <p>  In respect of social housing, my Department can provide full funding to local authorities for sites on which they bring forward suitable new social housing construction projects, including sites acquired by compulsory purchase order under the Derelict Sites Act. I am keen to see our local authorities expand their ownership of suitable sites for new social housing and with the record funding levels we have secured for new social housing delivery in 2021, we are in a position to support new projects including the associated site costs. It would be important for local authorities to engage with my Department directly and through the Housing Delivery Co-ordination Office in this connection.</p></reply>

All potential proposals are submitted by the proposers to the Housing Agency for initial assessment and co-ordination with local authorities. The proposal is then submitted to my Department for approval.</p><p>Under the scheme, the relevant housing authority is the landlord to the social housing tenant - nominated in accordance with their Scheme of Letting Priorities - and must ensure the Lessor discharges their obligations under the lease, including the delivery of management services in a manner consistent with the terms of the agreement. The enhanced leasing agreement is a performance-based contract where deductions apply to the rent if the management services requirements are not adequately performed. Prior to an enhanced lease commencing, the housing authority and the Lessor agree a Management Plan for the scheme to ensure efficient housing management services are delivered to tenants in line with the terms of the agreement. </p><p>Lease payments are paid to the property owner based on a discounted market rent, with the level of discount reflecting the maintenance responsibilities taken on by the owner. The maximum lease term is 25 years and rents are reviewed every 3 years linked to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).  All enhanced leasing proposals submitted to my Department must be accompanied by an independent valuation of the market rent for the properties, carried out by, or commissioned and paid for by, the relevant local authority.</p><p>The role of the Housing Agency is to assist housing authorities and my Department with the administration of the scheme. As part of the due diligence process for Enhanced Leasing, the Housing Agency engages with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and legal advisors, as required, to assess the ability of the proposed leasing entity to deliver the proposed dwellings and to provide the property maintenance services required. The Lessor&rsquo;s legal status, funding position and operational structure are assessed as part of this process. <b></b>The Agency liaises with the housing authority throughout the process to ensure that all required documentation is provided by the Lessor. Prospective Lessors are also subject to assessment by the solicitors acting on behalf of the housing authority. </p><p>While the Housing Agency acts as a national coordinator for the scheme, housing authorities retain their responsibilities in relation to social housing provision; assessment of social housing need and suitability, and tenancy management. At end 2020, a total of 113 Enhanced Leasing arrangements had been entered into by housing authorities.</p></reply>

On foot of a wide variety of interest from stakeholders in being involved in the provision of social housing, a structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with such parties. The Clearing House Group (CHG) was established to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved. The CHG comprised representatives from:</p><p>- Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government;</p><p>- Department of Finance; </p><p>- Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; </p><p>- Dublin City Council; and</p><p>- The Housing Agency; The National Economic and Social Council (NESC).  </p><p>The CHG was a sub-group of the Finance Work Stream, one of the governance structures of the Social Housing Strategy 2020.

Significant progress has already been made through the Enniskerry Road pilot project supported by Serviced Sites Funding, the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, and through legislative provisions in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which was recently approved by Government and is now published. Our approach to Cost Rental has been modelled on similar successful models elsewhere in Europe. </p>  <p>  Cost Rental homes will be governed in line with provisions in the forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill, which defines Cost Rental in Ireland for the first time and will regulate tenancies in which rents only cover clearly defined costs. The Bill sets out how 'financing costs' are an element of the overall cost of delivery to be covered by rents, and that this category includes both interest on debt funding and also a limited return on any equity investment. While the precise figure for this limit on equity return will be set in Regulations, it is intended that it will be informed by the moderate return permitted for Limited Profit Housing Associations in other jurisdictions where the model operates very successfully.  </p>  <p>  Delivery of Cost Rental is expected to be through public and charitable bodies initially - Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA), and AHBs. It is also expected that State resources will support this initial delivery. In particular, AHBs will utilise the CREL scheme administered by my Department and the Housing Agency, together with loans on more commercial terms from the Housing Finance Agency. Allowance for a limited return on equity will permit AHBs and the LDA to invest their own funds in a sustainable manner, receiving a small return through rents and growing their resources. </p>  <p>  While past experience has shown the difficulties in designing a Government policy intervention to be delivered 'off-balance sheet', the legislation has been drafted so as not to prohibit private sector involvement in future years. Some element of private investment may help to deliver Cost Rental at large scale in high-cost locations, in the context of limited Exchequer resources and the difficulties of securing reasonably-priced finance when projects are largely or wholly debt-funded. Although equity returns will regulated and limited, there may be interest from non-State investors able to take a long-term view or with a particular emphasis on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors. </p>  <p>  If a private body is willing to commit to making homes available within the Cost Rental framework for a period of at least 30-40 years, such additional provision at no cost to the State would be positive. Private sector providers would be limited to the same allowable costs as Local Authorities, the LDA, and AHBs, with the same limited return on any equity investment. A private body would also be subject to the same Regulations, which will include the application process for landlords, eligibility criteria for tenants, mandatory elements of tenancy agreements, and an auditing process under which landlords must retain records and supply them to the Minister on request.</p></reply>

Under section 254(5) of the Act, an application for such a licence shall be made to the relevant planning authority, or the Board on appeal, who, in determining an application or appeal, are required to have regard to the convenience and safety of all road users including pedestrians, the disabled and visually impaired.  </p><p>Furthermore, detailed information on the content of the new regulations and advice on their practical implementation was communicated by my Department to planning authorities by way of Planning Circular Letter PL 06-2021 which issued on 30 April last and which is available at the following link: </p><p>The Circular requested that planning authorities give consideration at a local level to the principles of Universal Design when assessing a licence application to ensure that the wider area is accessible, useable and convenient to all those who wish to use or pass through it, while also ensuring that any alternative street layout arrangements proposed in order to facilitate further outdoor dining, such as the relocation of designated accessible parking bays on temporarily pedestrianised streets, are appropriate and fit for purpose.  </p><p>In light of the foregoing, I am satisfied that local authorities have received appropriate and sufficient guidance on the implementation of the new arrangements at this time and that there is no immediate requirement for any further guidance in this matter.</p></reply>

As such, my Department does not collate information in relation to allocations by individual local authorities to households with a medical priority. Neither, does my Department collate information into the level of individual local authority funding that is used for the accommodation of households with a medical priority. However, details on the length of time spent on the record of qualified households (waiting lists) can be found at tables 2.8 and A1.8 of the report. It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time snapshot of the demand for social housing support in each local authority area and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the housing waiting lists.</p><p>Report 2020www.gov.ie/en/publication/970ea-summary-of-social-housing-assessments-2020-key-findings/#:~:text=The%20Summary%20of%20Social%20Housing,is%20not%20currently%20being%20met.</p><p>It is important to note that only the results of the 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 summaries are directly comparable with each other.

This new scheme was allocated &euro;35m in funding in Budget 2021, which is being used to make loans on favourable terms to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for up to 30% of the cost of new homes for Cost Rental. The announcement followed a Call for Proposals and a rigorous assessment process conducted by the Department and the Housing Agency. CREL financing has been granted this year for 390 new homes, to owned and let by the Tuath, Respond, and Cl&uacute;id AHBs. The homes are located in Dublin, the surrounding Greater Dublin Area, and Cork, with cost-covering rents projected to be at least 25% below comparable open market prices.</p>  <p>  The successful AHBs are completing the necessary financial and commercial arrangements in relation to these homes. When these arrangements are concluded, details of the funded projects, including specific locations, housing typologies, and cost-covering rents, will be made public.</p>  <p>  Cost Rental homes will be operated and allocated in line with provisions in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which was recently approved by Government and will be published imminently. The Bill defines Cost Rental in Ireland for the first time and will allow the Minister to regulate tenancies in which the rents only cover clearly defined costs.</p></reply>

To assist local authorities in achieving this objective, my Department has, since 2018, provided funding to each local authority of &euro;50,000 per annum. This funding is to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office, including a Vacant Homes Officer for each local authority.</p><p>The provision of central funding provides for focus to be given to the role of the Office and reinforces the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority.

The Vacant Home Action Plan identifies the scale of vacant homes in a local authority&rsquo;s jurisdiction and sets ambitious but realistic targets of the number of vacant homes that can ultimately be brought back into use. </p><p>As emphasised in the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy, securing improved data and analysis on vacancy allows for more robust monitoring of vacancy at a national level and improved outputs at local level. To help record levels of vacancy, the vacanthomes.ie website has been developed by Mayo County Council on behalf of the local government sector. This provides a central portal for individuals to anonymously log possible vacant properties and alert local authorities to those properties.  As appropriate, Vacant Homes Officers  can then follow up with the owners to see whether the house can be re-used quickly. </p><p>The latest statistics from vacanthomes.ie indicate that 5,210 properties have been recorded on the website since 2017. </p><p>Table 2 below indicates the number of properties registered on vacanthomes.ie by year and county:</p><p><b>Table 2 Vacant Homes Logged

That is why Ireland is the 14th largest core contributor to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the 24th largest contributor overall - supporting UNFPA's vital work in promoting universal access to health services, strengthening health systems globally, and preventing and responding to gender based violence. </p><p>My Department is aware of recent cuts in funding to UNFPA and other UN development agencies. We are working with our partners to assess the impact of these cuts and to ensure the continuation of their essential work.  The upcoming (June 2021) meeting of UNFPA&rsquo;s Executive Board, of which Ireland is currently an observer, provides an opportunity for further discussions.</p><p>Our funding to UN agencies is reviewed periodically, in the light of allocations to the official development assistance budget, and in view of agencies&rsquo; performance and the wider range of international development priorities to which Ireland seeks to respond. A &euro;3.5 million core contribution to UNFPA has been made in 2021, in line with contributions in 2020 and 2019 and compared to &euro;2.8 million in 2018.</p><p>In addition to the annual core contribution, Ireland also provides funding to UNFPA through bilateral programmes managed by our Embassies, which varies from year to year. In 2020, this additional funding to UNFPA amounted to &euro;1.8 million. Ireland does not provide direct funding to the UNFPA Supplies Programme.</p><p>Ireland also contributes to UNFPA through the EU. Collectively the EU and its Member States are the single largest financial contributor to the UN system, providing 25% of contributions to UN agencies. The European Commission provided US$43 million to UNFPA in 2019. </p></reply>

Our Missions in the United States continue to accept applications, and these will remain on file until the processing of applications resumes. </p>  <p>  During the pandemic, our primary concern in this regard has been the health, welfare and wellbeing of our citizens currently on working holidays abroad and of those from other countries in Ireland under WHAs. Throughout the pandemic, our Missions abroad have provided assistance in repatriating many of these Irish citizens, and our Missions continue to assist those who remained abroad.</p>  <p>  We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation here and in the relevant locations abroad, in terms particularly of public health advice, travel restrictions, job opportunities and the availability of short-term accommodation. We will instruct our Missions abroad to resume the processing of applications and issuance of authorisations once circumstances allow young people to benefit from a working holiday here and to fully experience Ireland&rsquo;s culture and way of life safely. </p></reply>

The template includes the eight priority sectors listed in the EPA&rsquo;s 2014 <i>Green Procurement Guidance for the Public Sector</i>. </p><p>The Department recognises the environmental benefits of Green Public Procurement, however, the majority of the Department&rsquo;s procurement contracts in Ireland are with small firms or individuals providing professional, consultancy and general services.</p><p>The Department submitted its 2020 GPP Report to the EPA on the 31<sup></sup>March 2021 (see tables below) and it will be published in due course in the Department&rsquo;s Annual Report 2020 in line with the Circular&rsquo;s provisions. </p><p><b>Department of Foreign Affairs &ndash; Green Public Procurement Report 2020</b></p><p>Table 1.

In engaging with the British Government,  we have taken every opportunity to reaffirm the critical importance of our roles as co-guarantors of the Agreement, to work for its protection and in support of its institutions. </p><p>The position of the Government on the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland has also been clear and consistent. The Stormont House Agreement is the way forward on these issues. It was agreed in 2014 by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it should be implemented. </p><p>Where the UK Government are proposing significant changes to that framework, we have made clear that these must be discussed and agreed by both Governments and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive. </p><p>In March of last year, the UK Government issued a Written Ministerial Statement that proposed significantly departing from the SHA. Since then, I have spoken regularly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to express our strong concerns and to reiterate the importance of a collective approach consistent with the Stormont House Agreement, and with international human rights obligations. I reaffirmed those critical principles to the Secretary of State when we met last week in Dublin, and strongly advised against any unilateral action on these sensitive issues.</p><p>Media reports last week of possible plans on to introduce a statute of limitations have of course caused significant upset, shock and concern.  It is essential that we make progress on dealing with the legacy of the past, but as the Stormont House Agreement sets out, there is a need to take a comprehensive view of how to achieve progress and reconciliation for society as a whole, and the needs of victims and families must be at the heart of the process.</p><p>We have strongly communicated our position on this issue to the UK Government and will continue to do so, and to caution in the clearest terms against any unilateral action. The Government remains ready to engage and work with the UK Government and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive, with a view to reaffirming a collective approach that is consistent with the Stormont House Agreement.</p></reply>

In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that my Department has allocated &euro;10m this year to the Defence Forces for the maintenance, repair and upkeep of its building stock .

For example:</p><p>- Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment within the general recruitment framework in that current campaigns reach out to females via a variety of channels, including social media, sporting organisations and schools. </p><p>- A Gender Equality and Diversity Officer has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. In addition, a gender-equality perspective is applied in the planning and execution of operations both at home and overseas and in all policies and regulations. Gender Advisors are available to all Brigades and Services and trained Gender Focal Points are deployed with all overseas units and ships in order to promote the gender perspective in operations. </p><p>- A Defence Forces Women's Network is established with the aim of increasing the participation of female personnel at all levels of the organisation. </p><p>Over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence, a number of projects will be progressed to ensure the development and promotion of strategies that continue to support increased female participation in the Defence Forces. </p><p>In addition, a review of recruitment practices and processes in the PDF, tasked under the High Level Implementation Plan arising from the Public Service Pay Commission report, has additionally examined all aspects of the recruitment process, including diversity, as part of its work. It is anticipated that this report will be finalised shortly.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Commission on the Defence Forces, as part of its terms of reference, will set out a strategic perspective on all HR policies, and associated strategies in light of the prevailing dynamics of the labour market, while remaining consistent with public sector pay and personnel policy</p><p>The Commission is due to issue its report at the end of the year.

Since publication of the White Paper, a total of 95 separate projects have been identified for completion over a ten-year period.  To provide flexibility, projects may be sub-divided or merged, changing the top-line number.  Project and Programme Management Governance arrangements were put in place to monitor the ongoing status of individual projects and to review the scope of projects within the programme.</p>  <p>  Following on from the White Paper Update 2019 and the Government&rsquo;s High Level Plan to implement the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission, senior civil and military management have concluded a review of the projects which has resulted in reprioritisation of certain projects.  This takes account of work that is progressing across the organisation which has been contributing to implementation of the White Paper.</p>  <p>  The review of progress on all projects has led to the approval of an updated White Paper Programme Implementation Roadmap.  Of the initial 95 projects, 47 are now formally completed and closed with an additional 3 in the closing process.  A further 14 projects related to the Defence Forces Reserve will be considered post-Commission on the Defence Forces.  12 projects are currently active with a further 4 due to be initiated during 2021 and the remaining 15 projects to be initiated during 2022 and 2023.  </p>  <p>  Work in certain areas will in its nature continue beyond 2025 in order to ensure that changes, improvements and actions envisaged in the White Paper are fully implemented and are embedded in the day to day business of the Defence Organisation.  Implementation of all of the projects is being carried out on a phased basis through the use of a project management framework with each being managed by a joint Civil-Military Project Team.

Procurement procedures are kept under constant review to ensure that they are line with best practice, guidance and the legal framework. This includes the incorporation of social clauses including environmental and green considerations into public procurement contracts where applicable. </p>  <p>  Circular 20/2019 instructed all Departments including Defence to incorporate green considerations into the planning, process and reporting aspects of their respective procurement programs. The Defence Organisation has fully engaged with green procurement and wheresoever possible green procurement considerations are utilised as either selection or award criteria in procurement projects published to the market. In addition, public procurement contracts are reviewed on a case by case basis to ensure compliance with all applicable obligations in the fields of environmental law applying under national and EU law as well as various international conventions on environmental law matters.</p>  <p>  Each relevant branch of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces supply such information which is collated and to date has been reported in the Annual Report by reference to energy consumption. The nature of the business of the Defence Organisation largely confines social and environmental considerations to environmental/climate change control inputs such as carbon footprint, recycling, renewables and biodegradables. Specific energy conservation measures have been put in place and the results are closely monitored. Examples of green procurement outputs include:</p>  <p>  1. Ongoing solar PV rollout to eleven Defence Force locations which year on year have seen a 340% increase of renewably generated electricity.</p>  <p>  2. Continued replacement of carbon fuelled vehicles with electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  3. Further installation of heat pumps on Defence Force facilities.</p>  <p>  The commitment by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to adapt and utilise green procurement with attendant social and environmental considerations remains steadfast.

Leadership Training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations. Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills. Career Training, and education, provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces.</p><p>The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements. </p><p>The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms of the organisation against best military and academic practice. Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners.

While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps operate a fleet of fixed and rotary wing aircraft which provide military support to the Army and Naval Service, together with support for non-military air services such as Garda air support, air ambulance, fisheries protection and the Ministerial Air Transport Service.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied the all branches off the Defence Forces remain adequately resourced to fulfil all roles as assigned by government. This includes the agility of all three services, Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, to adapt to the specific tasking on hand at any given time, whether that be fisheries protection, overseas deployment, EAS or Aid to the Civil Power. The multifaceted nature of the role of the Defence Forces in Irish life is an aspect of our Military that I am particularly proud of. </p></reply>

The Commission&rsquo;s overall approach will be guided and informed by both the White Paper on Defence 2015 and the White Paper Update 2019.  As part of a broader consultation process, the Commission invited submissions from individuals and organisations on issues relevant to its Terms of Reference.  The  Commission received over 500 submissions which they are currently analysing.   </p>  <p>  - The members of the Commission have been carefully chosen to ensure the optimum range of expertise in key areas.  The Commission is chaired by Aidan O'Driscoll, a former Secretary General in two Government Departments.  He is joined by 14 other members with national and international expertise across a range of disciplines.  The Commission has engaged with stakeholders including the Representative Associations, Officer and Enlisted ranks in the Defence Forces and other relevant groups and have visited Defence installations to meet Defence Force members directly with more visits scheduled for the Summer. </p>  <p>  Following the work of the Commission the Programme for Government commits to the establishment of a Permanent Pay Review body for the Defence Forces which must be consistent with national public sector wage policy.  The Commission is to submit their report by the end of the year and it will be considered fully at that time.    </p>  <p>  This work will continue alongside the on-going work of White Paper implementation projects, the High Level Implementation Plan arising from the Public Service Pay Commission Report on the Defence Forces,  the Equipment Development Plan and the Infrastructure Development plan, both five year rolling plans published last year, and all the other work being undertaken by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to ensure the Defence Organisation can fulfil all roles as set out by Government. </p></reply>

This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. The current position regarding the major equipment platform projects is as follows.</p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of 80 General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles is well underway.   This programme is on-going and continues to command significant resources and commitment of effort.  The vehicle, which is the backbone of Defence Forces armoured capability, has been well proven in all its roles since the first vehicles were introduced in 2001.  By end-2020, some 47 vehicles have been upgraded including modernisation of protection systems and weapons. The overall programme is due to be completed by 2023. In addition, an order for 28 Armoured Utility Vehicles AUVs was recently placed with Centigon, a French company, and these will provide a level of protected mobility between the levels of soft-skinned light transport and heavier armoured vehicles. Delivery of these vehicles is expected to complete in 2021.</p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment. In July of 2020 a tender competition was commenced for the supply of Software Defined Radios to the Defence Forces and the competition is currently underway. The scope of the project consists of two main requirements; Personal Soldier Radios and Multi-Band Handheld, Manpack, Vehicular and Airborne radios. Given the complexity of the requirements, the procurement process is on-going and is comprehensive in nature with the first radios not expected to enter service before 2023.</p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet.  In 2019, a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3/4 tonne 4X4 vehicles, the first of which entered service in early 2020.  In March of last year, a tender process was completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4X4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with the award of a contract to Westward Scania, based in Strokestown, Co. Roscommon.  The first vehicles arrived in Mar-Apr of 2021 with delivery of all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023.  Funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022.   Budget 2021 provides for a further increased gross allocation to &euro;131m in the defence capital budget in respect of equipment and barracks infrastructure.  This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

They are invited to make submissions as to how much, if any of the compensation should be taken into account in fixing the rate of disability pension.  The Minister then makes a <i>bona fide</i>decision based on a consideration of all circumstances of the case, including the annuity value of the compensation awarded. </p><p>The Minister may decide to take all, some or none of the compensation into account in fixing the rate of disability pension.  If the Minister decides to reduce the disability pension under Section 13(2), the reduction applies for the lifetime of the pension.</p><p>In April 1986 the person in question was awarded a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of an injury sustained while serving in the PDF. The person in question also instituted civil proceedings in respect of the same injury and was awarded compensation by the High Court.  The disability pension payable was therefore reviewed under the provisions of section 13(2) of the 1923 Act and it was decided to reduce it by the annuity value of the total compensation which the person in question had received. The annuity value in question was not a calculation based on recovery of the amount of compensation involved.  Instead, the purpose is to use an actuarial assessment to reduce the pension in a fair way to avoid payment &ldquo;on the double&rdquo; where compensation has already been received.</p><p>Subsequently, the person in question applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the decision to reduce the disability pension. The High Court quashed the decision to reduce the disability pension and ordered that the matter be considered anew. A fresh review of the disability pension was accordingly undertaken.  All aspects of the case (including, in particular, representations made by his solicitors) were fully considered and in March 1988 the then Minister decided to reduce the disability pension payable by the annuity value of the total  compensation received by the person in question. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the Courts, in various previous judgements, have upheld the Minister&rsquo;s statutory right to take into consideration that part of the damages which can properly be regarded as general damages or that part which can properly be regarded as referable to loss of earnings, or both these parts, as he considers proper.  Alternatively, the Minister may decide to take none of the compensation into account.</p><p>I am satisfied that the disability pension in this case was properly determined in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions by the then Minister and I do not believe that a further review of the decision under Section 13(2) would be appropriate. </p></reply>

The initiative encourages schools to look at their current provision in terms of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Partnerships and thereafter to make improvements. The Initiative seeks to recognise schools that strive to achieve a physically educated and physically active school community.</p>  <p>  In Junior Cycle, Physical Education is recognised as part of the Well-being area of learning as outlined in the Framework for Junior Cycle. Physical Education is allocated a minimum of 135 hours across the three years of Junior Cycle.

The CMO has made it very clear in his advices to Government which are published on gov.ie, that schools are places of low transmission, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections of children and adolescents occurs outside the school setting. This is supported by Public Health doctors. Schools have put significant infection prevention control measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to/within the school and significant funding of almost &euro;650 million has been put in place by my Department to fund Covid-19 related measures, including funding for PPE, sanitation and additional cleaning etc.  </p>  <p>  The weekly reports from Public Health since schools reopened are very reassuring, showing that the close contact positivity rate in schools is remaining very stable and is still at a low level. Unavoidably there has been some outbreaks and some students have had to return for a short period to remote teaching and learning.  However, I am confident that the combined supports from my Department and the HSE schools teams are proving very effective in supporting schools to manage through these events.</p>  <p>  There is a dedicated school principal&rsquo;s help line open seven days a week supported by staff of the Department. This is a dedicated service for principals. Following the reopening of schools on a phased basis in February/March 2021, the Department increased the percentage assignment of Department inspectors to the HSE to support this dedicated phone line.  The Department is coordinating closely with the HSE Public Health Team on a weekly basis &ndash; and sometimes more frequently &ndash; to manage the support needed by the HSE and to keep the level of staffing for the support lines under review. </p>  <p>  Public health have also reaffirmed to the Department that full contact tracing and bulk fast-track testing within the school setting has resumed following the period of school closures. </p></reply>

Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2 km at primary and 4.8 km at post-primary and are attending their nearest School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services for the 2021/22 school year where such services are in operation. </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only.  Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education cycle.  Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that the family referred to by the Deputy are not eligible for school transport as they are not attending their closest school. </p>  <p>  An application for transport for one family member was received on 29th March 2019 to travel to the school of attendance and this application will carry over to the current school year.  However, no further school transport applications have been received by Bus &Eacute;ireann for this family for the 2021/2022 school year.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that this family reside 400 m from the bus pick up point for the service to their school of attendance. Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the planning and timetabling of school transport routes.

Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to Senior Cycle. My Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines. </p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the NCCA to determine the approach to best give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to develop an inclusive and age-appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships. In this regard, the NCCA have recently published learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum on their online toolkit which supports teaching and learning linked to the current curriculum; and work on developing a new Junior Cycle curriculum begins in September. Should any legislative changes be required I am committed to making such changes, as set out in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The key purpose of the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 was to amend section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 to better protect employees against discrimination in an appropriate and balanced way, while respecting religious freedoms guaranteed in the  Constitution.</p>  <p>  The amended section 37 now oblige relevant employers in religious-run schools and hospitals to show that any favourable treatment of an employee or prospective employee is limited to the religion ground and action taken against a person is objectively justified by reference to that institution&rsquo;s aim of protecting its religious ethos and that the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.  The new provision provides that action taken against an employee or prospective employee on the religion ground shall not be regarded as justified unless it is: </p>  <p>  -  rationally and strictly related to the institution&rsquo;s religious ethos;</p>  <p>  -  a response to conduct of a person which undermines or would undermine the religious ethos of the institution, rather than being a response to that person&rsquo;s status under any of the other discrimination grounds (e.g. sexual orientation) set out in equality legislation; and</p>  <p>  -  proportionate to the conduct of the employee or prospective employee, having regard to alternative action the employer could take, the consequences of any action taken for the employee or prospective employee and the actual damage caused to the religious ethos of the institution.</p>  <p>  This raises the threshold for discrimination so that religious run schools and hospitals  must now show real damage to their ethos, are precluded from discrimination on any of the other equality grounds and that any action taken is reasonable and proportionate.   </p>  <p>  Any proposed amendments to the Employment Equality Act would be a matter for the Department of Justice.</p></reply>

The current COVID-19 arrangements in place for teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are outlined in my Department&rsquo;s <i>Circular Letter 0021/2021</i>.  </p><p>My Department has an enhanced Occupational Health Service (OHS) in place, to provide employers with occupational health advice in relation to teacher&rsquo; fitness for work.  The current OHS provider, Medmark Occupational Healthcare Ltd. has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about their risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, through workplace attendance.</p><p>A detailed on-line questionnaire is submitted by the teacher to the OHS, along with detailed medical evidence to provide clarity with respect to the medical complaint(s) in question.  All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when a teacher suffers from more than one health condition. The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  A teacher is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are &lsquo;Normal Risk&rsquo;, High Risk&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo;. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the HSE guidance.  My Department is following the same guidance that is in use across the public sector. </p><p>Based on the current HSE advice, a &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; teacher, including a teacher who has been fully vaccinated, must not attend the workplace. However, the teacher remains available for work and the employer should prioritise alternative working arrangements to the maximum extent possible e.g. work from home. Where there is a change to the current HSE advice regarding the &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; group attending the workplace, my Department will inform employers. </p><p>Having considered the current HSE advice, a &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; teacher who wants to attend the workplace may, however, contact his/her employer so that the school&rsquo;s COVID-19 Response Plan can be discussed, ahead of a workplace risk assessment.  The &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; teacher must fully understand any risk he/she is taking by requesting a return to the workplace.  Where the employer is satisfied the appropriate safeguards are in place in the teacher&rsquo;s work environment, medical advice must then be sought from the OHS, before the &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; teacher can be considered for a return to the workplace.</p></reply>

Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. </p><p>In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE takes account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.  The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p><p>When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation (Additional School Accommodation Scheme).  Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>My Department has also confirmed the establishment of two further new special schools in Cork and Dublin to open in the 2021/22 school year.</p></reply>

DES Circulars 007 and 008 of 2019 set out how the allocations for schools were updated from September 2019.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. Under the allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school.</p><p>Under the allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>The total number of SETs has increased by 39% since 2011, from 9,740 at that time, to over 13,600 at present. </p><p>Budget 2021 provided for an additional 990 additional Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) posts for allocation to schools, bringing the total numbers to 18,000 by the end of December 2021.  This allocation of SNAs is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2021 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes and the transition to the new allocation model for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>The Budget 2021 increase to 18,000 SNAs posts represents an increase of increase of 70% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.</p><p>The NCSE has published statistical information regarding SNA allocations for all schools which can be accessed on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie </i>or by using the following link <i></i>.  </p><p>I am satisfied that the very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years, and for 2021, to provide Special Education Teachers and Special Needs Assistants, means that all schools can be sufficiently resourced to provide for the special educational needs and care needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

It is the aim of my Department that every child has access to equitable education and that each learner feels safe and happy in the school environment, at every stage. </p>  <p>  At post-primary level, there are a number of prescribed texts for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate English. </p>  <p>  The decision on which particular text to use rests with the school itself. They can choose whichever text best suits the context of their teaching and their students. </p>  <p>  At national level a variety of factors influence the selection of prescribed texts including the merit of the text on grounds of excellence, the aspiration to achieve social and cultural diversity and inclusivity, the age appropriateness of texts, as well as practical factors, such as availability and cost. As prescribed lists are developed from year to year, additional factors come to the fore and influence the choices made. In addition, newly published authors are considered for inclusion. Contemporary issues and world events also impact on prescription.</p>  <p>  The prescribed text list working groups for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate English is informed and guided by Criteria for the Selection of Texts which aims to achieve a balance between classic and contemporary texts; Irish and non-Irish authorship; seeks gender balance in authorship and representation; embraces diversity and inclusion; accessibility of texts; general suitability and comparative potential. </p>  <p>  The text list working groups are convened by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) Education Officer for the subject in question. Participation in the group is on a voluntary basis. In general, the group comprises teachers, third level lecturers, staff from relevant support services/support agencies and experts in children&rsquo;s and young adult literature. The rationale for the approach taken towards the generation of text lists is that it is a highly deliberative and time-intensive process.</p>  <p>  Achieving a balanced list of texts remains a challenging and worthwhile endeavour and work continues to create a broadly balanced, diverse and inclusive list every year. For example, the most recently published list of prescribed texts for Junior Cycle English is current for the student cohorts 2018-21, 2019-22 and 2020&ndash;23. This list will be reviewed in the coming months and made available to schools for the 2021-24 cohort. In a similar way, the text list for Leaving Certificate English will be reviewed for the cohort of students who will study for the Leaving Certificate examination in 2024. </p>  <p>  The NCCA regularly receives recommendations and advice about texts for consideration and inclusion in courses. Parents, teachers, and students can make suggestions through an online facility which can be accessed on the NCCA website: All submissions are considered by the relevant text list group as they review and update the selection of texts for subsequent groups of students. </p>  <p>  In addition, the NCCA is currently undertaking research on international best practice with regard to text selection and this will inform the ongoing review of the NCCA&rsquo;s selection of texts. </p></reply>

In addition, a three point reduction in the retention scale has also been introduced for September 2021.  These measures will help to ensure that less pupils are required to recruit or retain a teacher.</p>  <p>  The allocation of teaching posts must be done in a way that is fair to all schools, and some schools will continue to lose posts while others will gain a posts as their respective enrolments rise and fall.  This is important to ensuring equity in the school system and that posts are allocated to where they are needed.</p>  <p>  In December 2019, Government approved the national roll out of a new frontloading model for the allocation of SNAs support to primary and post-primary schools for students in mainstream classes, as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM).</p>  <p>  In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for Special Needs Assistants for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p>  <p>  The disruption prevented the delivery of the necessary training and information workshops to support the roll out of the new allocation model which had been planned for earlier this year.</p>  <p>  The training and workshops are designed to help school leaders and teachers in their in-school planning for the new model and their engagement with parents.

The circular stated : &lsquo;It is envisaged that advisory, research and evaluation work will continue in the second and third terms of the school year 2020/21 and the Inspectorate is also planning for a carefully phased recommencement of a limited programme of normal inspection work in this period.&rsquo;  Circulars 001/2021 and 002/2021, which issued in January 2021 drew schools attention to Circulars 40/2020 and 41/2020. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, a small number of incidental inspections have been undertaken in schools since 16 April 2021. All of these incidental inspections, other than in very exceptional circumstances, are notified in advance to the principals of the schools concerned which allows for arrangements to be put in place to carry out the visits safely.  The focus of these visits is on providing advice to teachers and schools on aspects of teaching and learning in a context where students have missed a great deal of face-to-face instruction in Term 2 of the current school year. These inspections will also provide the Inspectorate with important information on the impact of school closures on student learning and on how teachers and schools are responding to students&rsquo; needs in the pandemic context.    Feedback from schools and inspectors on the inspections carried out to date has been positive overall and principals have generally welcomed the opportunity to engage in professional dialogue with inspectors on the work of their school in the pandemic context. </p>  <p>As outlined in the circulars above, the Inspectorate is also continuing to conduct urgent follow-through inspections, child protection-related inspections and Sustaining Safe Provision of Schools (SSPS) inspections in a sample of schools.</p></reply>

Each school is required to have an anti-bullying policy within its overall code of behaviour.  The anti-bullying procedures are underpinned by this legal framework and all schools are required to comply with them.</p><p>Under the procedures, all school boards of management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy which fully complies with the requirements of these procedures.  A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures along with a standardised template for recording bullying behaviour.</p><p>The procedures for schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular the policy must set out the school&rsquo;s procedures for investigating and dealing with bullying and the school&rsquo;s procedures for the formal noting and recording of bullying behaviour.  </p><p>The Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools 2017 give clear direction and guidance to school authorities and to school personnel in relation to meeting the statutory obligations under the Children First Act, 2015 and in the continued implementation within the school setting of the best practice guidance set out in the updated Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017.  The Child Protection Procedures provide that in cases of serious instances of bullying where the behaviour is regarded as possibly abusive, a referral may need to be made by the school to Tusla or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as appropriate. Where school personnel have concerns about a child arising from alleged bullying behaviour but are not sure whether to report the matter to Tusla, the school designated liaison person should seek advice from Tusla.</p><p>The Anti-Bullying Procedures already provide that the board of management of each school, in developing its anti-bullying policy, must formulate the policy in co-operation with both teaching and non-teaching school staff under the leadership of the principal and in consultation with parents and pupils. The need to consult with parents will be further underpinned in law once the Education (Student and Parent Charter Bill) 2019 is enacted. Under the legislation, each school will be required to prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines to be published following consultation with the education partners, including those bodies representing parents. The overall aim of the legislation is to improve the level of engagement between schools and students and their parents by inviting feedback, comment and observations from students and parents and by developing a listening culture in the school. </p><p>In this context one of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities.  This approach will help ensure that the various views of students and parents will be heard and responded to by schools on issues or policies including a school&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying Policy.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse / partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme. The means assessment reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of income or capital are in a position to use these resources to support themselves so that social welfare expenditure can be directed towards those who need it most.</p>  <p>  Cash income that is assessed includes any income from employment or self-employment, income from a social security pension from another country and maintenance payments.</p>  <p>  Blind Pension recipients can earn up to &euro;120 per week from employment or self-employment without their payment being affected, while weekly earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are assessed at 50%. A &euro;20 increase in this disregard was announced as part of Budget 2021 and will take effect from next month, meaning that the first &euro;140 per week from employment or self-employment will be disregarded. This income disregard aims to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in work while retaining  some or all of their social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Capital assessed as part of the means test includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares, as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. The family home is never assessed as part of the means test, regardless of who is the legal owner. </p>  <p>  For Blind Pension, the first &euro;20,000 of capital from any sources is not assessed, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, while any amount above &euro;40,000 is assessed at four euro per thousand.</p>  <p>  Any changes to means assessments for schemes, including the Blind Pension, will be considered within the overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

The application for the 2020 grant was disallowed on the grounds that the person concerned was not providing care on the first Thursday in June, 2020 as the person she was caring for passed away on 23 May 2020. The person concerned was notified of both decisions on 10 November 2020 and informed of her right of review and appeal. </p>  <p>  The person concerned requested a review and an appeal of the decision.</p>  <p>  She was notified by the Department, on the 03 December 2020, that on review the original decision was upheld. On 12 April 2021 the Social Welfare Appeals Office notified the person concerned that her appeal was disallowed. </p>  <p>  Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of an Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed in the light of relevant additional evidence or new facts. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department may make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses where there is an inability to pay these costs, in part or in full, by the family of the deceased person without causing hardship. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Refugees are assisted in the early months after resettlement by a resettlement support worker and an intercultural support worker who assist with access to services that may be necessary for health, education, or other purposes </p></reply>

Therefore neither I nor my Department have a function in relation to such matters and it is not within my remit to determine admissions criteria or direct HEIs to admit certain students.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that a total of 632 CAO offers have been made to students whose results in the 2020 written Leaving Certificate examinations brought them into consideration for a higher preference offer from their 2020 CAO application. These students will have the option to take up these offers for the 2021 academic year. Students who sat the 2020 written examinations but did not achieve the points needed for a higher preference offer had the option to apply for the 2021 academic year using their updated results. However any offers made to these students will be on the basis of the 2021 points requirements.</p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups, or students with results from different years.</p></reply>

Therefore an application, for  a certificate of naturalisation, from a person whose reckonable residence is derived wholly or in part while resident in direct provision accommodation will not be impacted.</p><p>I recognise and acknowledge the crucial role frontline workers are continuing to play in responding to the threat of COVID-19.

Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p><p>A significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during COVID-19. On 18 January 2021, a temporary system that enables applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty was opened. Approximately 1,708 people have received their Irish citizenship since then including a significant number of healthcare and other frontline workers. A further 1,057 people have returned their signed statutory declarations and the Immigration Service will be sending them their certificates of naturalisation in the coming weeks.</p><p>It has also been decided to extend the statutory declaration process to a further 2,500 people by the end of June. At that point, we will have communicated with all those that were recorded, as at 30 December 2020, as having been in the system 24 months or more and 6,500 people, including a significant number of healthcare and other frontline workers, will have been given the opportunity to complete their Irish citizenship. Those receiving a communication from my Department are being invited to complete the final steps required prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation.</p><p>In-person citizenship ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured.</p><p>Plans for the digitalisation of the naturalisation process are well advanced, in line with the plan to significantly modernise the Justice Sector through increased digital and ICT investment.

All applicants for a certificate of naturalisation must supply original passports in support of their applications due to the requirement for applicants to firmly establish their identity to the satisfaction of the Minister. The requirement to supply original, in date and valid passports applies to all applicants. </p>  <p>  Under normal circumstances, passports are returned approximately 10 days after their receipt.  However, the current limits on staff attendance in the office due to COVID-19 restrictions, has resulted in delays in the return of some passports. </p>  <p>  Applicants are advised not to send in their application during the pandemic if they anticipate that they may have to travel at short notice. However, I fully appreciate that people may have to travel at short notice for emergency reasons.  The citizenship website advises that in these circumstances, applicants should email the citizenship helpdesk citizenshipinfo@justice.ie with the relevant details including postal tracking reference if available. Any request must be accompanied by appropriate scanned supporting material detailing the reasons for travel. Any request of this nature is dealt with promptly. </p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:  <i></i></p><p>It is important to note that the NIAC has advised that there is no evidence to show a significantly increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease, independent of age and other comorbidities, in any occupational group other than frontline healthcare workers to prioritise them for vaccination above their age-cohort.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.</p><p>In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time. Further detail is available on Gov.ie: <i></i>. </p><p>NPHET advise that this phased plan for the months of May and June can be considered low to medium risk. However, they also advise that a faster reopening over these months would be very high risk. A number of higher-risk activities including outdoor mass gatherings and events (such as parkruns for example) are not part of the reopening plans for May and June, but they will be subject to further consideration towards the end of June with a view to recommencing these activities as we move through the summer. </p><p>In relation to parkrun events, I understand that during the Covid-19 pandemic, parkrun have been supporting participants to take part in individual exercise, such as (not)parkrun, which promoted individual 5k runs, in line with public health guidelines. Given the numbers participating in parkruns prior to the pandemic, current guidelines do not allow for the immediate return of parkrun events. However, my Department, through Healthy Ireland, the HSE and Sport Ireland, through the Expert Working Group-Return to Sport, are committed to working with and supporting all organisations to return to activity safely and in line with current and evolving public health guidance.  There continues to be regular contact with parkrun organisers and detailed discussions regarding a return of parkrun events will commence once Government has taken decisions in relation to the re-introduction of outdoor mass participation events.</p><p>It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, this approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services.  </p><p>It is also important to note that while there is considerably less risk of transmission of COVID-19 outdoors compared to indoors, outdoors activities are not entirely risk-free. HIQA undertook an evidence review on higher-risk environments and activities for the NPHET in November 2020, drawing on national and international evidence. The Review found that while there is consistent evidence that the risk of outdoor transmission of COVID-19 is substantially lower, there is still evidence of transmission occurring in outdoor environments. This is particularly the case when there are large gatherings, where social distancing or the use of face coverings are neglected, and where there is dense congregation and mixing among groups. There are also risks linked to what might precede and follow outdoor gatherings including associated events and activities and shared travel to or from events or activities. The review is available here (<i></i>.) </p><p>Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department , following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:  <i></i></p><p>Vaccine registration for those aged 50 to 59 years is ongoing.</p></reply>

The Minister for Health commenced Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act of 2015 on 4 May 2020. Specifically, Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 provide a legal framework for parentage of children who are born as result of assisted human reproduction (AHR) involving donated eggs or sperm or embryos. Records are also required to be kept in relation to the identity of the donor(s), the child, the mother and the intending parent for the purposes of enabling donor-conceived children to access information relating to their genetic inheritance.  </p>  <p>  A legal framework to regulate surrogacy is included in the forthcoming AHR legislation; drafting of this Bill is ongoing by officials in my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. The surrogacy provisions outline a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s). Subject to certain criteria being met, AHR treatment involving gamete donation and domestic surrogacy will be available to people irrespective of gender, marital status or sexual orientation.</p>  <p>  The AHR legislation aims to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents and others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers), while, most importantly, consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born as a result of AHR is a key principle underpinning all legislative measures in this area.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.</p><p>In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time. Further detail is available on Gov.ie: <i></i></p><p>Drive through events such as bingo are not permitted under current public health restrictions commencing on the 10 May. The level of restrictions will be kept under review by Government.</p><p>It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, this approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services. In this regard, the NPHET has advised that the current reopening plans can be considered low to medium risk. They also advise that a faster reopening would be very high risk.</p><p>Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland.

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:  <i></i></p><p>It is important to note that the NIAC has advised that there is no evidence to show a significantly increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease, independent of age and other comorbidities, in any occupational group other than front-line healthcare workers to prioritise them for vaccination above their age-cohort.</p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards. </p><p>HIQA, in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing homes meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Expert was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified. </p><p>Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations.</p><p>Within this context, the State will continue to support the families concerned by providing as much information as possible on this issue.</p></reply>

Elective hospital care was curtailed for the first quarter of 2021, in line with the rapid increase in Covid-19 hospital admissions, with only critical time dependent elective procedures undertaken. </p>  <p>  On 23 March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;. This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first. Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local Covid-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity. Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. </p>  <p>  The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This includes increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p>  <p>  At the end of March 2021, nationwide there were 11,629 patients waiting for an adult or child orthopaedic IPDC procedure, a reduction of 8.8% (-1,125) compared to the same period last year. At the end of March 2021 there were 80,039 waiting for a first outpatient appointment across all hospital groups, an increase of 14% (+9,937) compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  Specifically in terms of the hip and knee replacements, the NTPF have advised the Department that at the end of May 2020 there were 3,042 patients waiting for such a procedure. Through focused activity, and with the support of the NTPF, at the end of March 2021 this figure had fallen by 26% to 2,252 patients. </p>  <p>  The NTPF continues to work closely with public hospitals to arrange treatment for clinically suitable long-waiting patients on hospital outpatient and inpatient/day case waiting lists. Year to date at the end of March 2021, the NTPF had arranged 6,951 Outpatient appointments, of which 1,971 were Orthopaedic appointments. During the same period, 5,877 patients on the Inpatient/Day Case waiting lists had accepted offers of treatment funded by the NTPF, of which 1,221 were for Orthopaedic procedures.</p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised my Department that they have approved one IPDC orthopaedic initiative so far in 2021 for Galway University Hospital, which will facilitate treatment for 82 patients on orthopaedics waiting lists. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040. In regard to the second operating theatre in Merlin Park University Hospital, the HSE has advised my Department that a contractor has been appointed and works commenced on site in February 2021.  Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department engage on an on-going basis with representatives from the HSE and NTPF to monitor demand for scheduled care services, through the continual surveillance of waiting lists and activity levels. &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 to improve access to care, &euro;210 million of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of Covid-19, as well as to address waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In this context the Department of Health, together with the HSE and the NTPF, is currently working on drafting a Sl&aacute;intecare multiannual waiting list plan to address backlogs in waiting lists and to bring waiting times in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p></reply>

The Elective Hospitals Oversight Group has the following terms of reference: </p><p>1. To develop the elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need, which facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care.</p><p>2. To provide quicker, higher quality, safer care for selected, elective patients.</p><p>3. To create capacity for acute hospital sites and reduce/eliminate outlier boarding (trolleys).</p><p>4. To drive down waiting lists, both outpatient, inpatient and day case.</p><p>5. To reduce cancellations.</p><p>6. To reduce acute hospital footfall. </p><p>The Oversight Group is following the process outlined in the Public Spending Code, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Guide setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning and management of large public investment projects in Ireland. As required under the Code, a Strategic Assessment Report has been completed and approved for the development of Elective Hospital facilities. This sets out the rationale for investment, the alignment of the programme with strategic requirements of Government, some initial options and potential costs, and the governance of the programme. </p><p>The Preliminary Business Case (PBC), in accordance with the Public Spending Code, is also under preparation.  As part of the PBC process, a site identification exercise in Dublin, Cork and Galway has begun. The Elective Hospitals Oversight Group has sought site submissions from members of the public, the HSE and Land Development Agency. Sites submitted will go through a two-stage evaluation process to examine their suitability, including a multi-criteria assessment and cost effectiveness assessment with a view to the Preliminary Business Case recommending a single preferred site option in each of the three locations. Once completed, under the Public Spending Code, the PBC will be assessed by the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and submitted to Government for its consideration.</p><p>As a preferred site option has not yet been approved, the issue of seeking planning permission does not yet arise.  </p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office and the Electives Hospital Oversight Group are engaged with the Saolta Hospital Group about its infrastructure needs. The site requirements for these infrastructure needs have been considered in the site selection process currently underway.</p><p>Under the Public Spending Code, Government Decisions will be required at a number of stages. It is not possible to be definitive about timelines, but it is hoped that construction can begin in 2023 and that the new elective centres will be operational no later than 2025.</p></reply>

This is true regardless of the separation distance between the project and the European site(s).  </p><p>A likely zone of impact is used in order to identify those European Sites to be specifically addressed during screening. In making a decision regarding the likelihood of a project having a significant effect on a European Site(s), all European Sites within a certain radius (or &lsquo;likely zone of impact&rsquo;) should be considered at screening stage, in addition to hydrologically-connected European Sites.  For example, in relation to a Special Protection Area, it is important to consider whether the project area lies within the foraging distance of bird species for which that SPA was designated, and many of these foraging distances exceed 3km.  After considering a range of inputs including NPWS guidance, feedback from the FAC and advice from the Department's environmental consultants, this was set at 15km for forestry applications which is also the standard generally used for applications in other sectors. </p><p>In determining the foraging distance of bird species, the Scottish Natural Heritage publication (2016) Assessing Connectivity with Special Protection Areas (SPAs) Guidance (version 3) was among the reference material used. The purpose of this publication was to help identify the connectivity between development proposals and SPAs. It recommended that, in most cases, the core range should be used when determining whether there is connectivity between the proposal and the qualifying interests. </p><p>It identified the core foraging range from nest site during breeding season (for example, 5km for Merlin) and the core foraging range from night roost during winter season for a range of species (for example, 5km for Whooper swan, 5 &ndash; 8km for Greenland White fronted goose and 15km for barnacle goose).

The specific health requirements for trading in bees are laid out in Regulation 2016/429.  All imports of bees must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the country of export after a physical inspection of the bees and their packaging has taken place. This is to ensure that imported bees are healthy and do not harbour pathogens or parasites that may be harmful to our native bee stocks. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are evaluating the current measures and supports in place for apis mellifera mellifera as well as possibilities around the merits of further research. While the European Commission has noted that a member state may at national level decide whether or not to give legal protection to a sub-species and to take the necessary conservation measures to protect it, the importation of bees is subject to EU regulation on intra community trade, any legal protection that would contravene that trade would need to be scientifically robust and also be justified and proportionate.</p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge the important contribution bees make to agriculture and biodiversity as both pollinators and honey producers. In this regard, my Department provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations. These supports include funding to carry out applied research through the National Apiculture Programme, grants to national beekeeping associations and grant aid to fund capital investments for beekeepers. My Department is also a partner in the All Ireland Pollinator Plan 2021 &ndash; 2025 and is a member of the All-Ireland Honeybee Strategy Steering Group.</p>  <p>  My Department has funded a number of studies under the Genetic Research Grant Aid Scheme looking at various aspects of this honeybee species and specifically apis mellifera melliferra. In 2021, funding has been allocated for an innovative queen rearing project.  My Department also supports the conservation work of the Native Irish Honey Bee Society.</p></reply>
