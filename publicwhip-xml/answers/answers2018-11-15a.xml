    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-15a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111500050#WRA00600"><p>My Department&rsquo;s primary interest in relation to the hare is its conservation status.  EU Directive 92/43/EEC (the Habitats Directive) requires Ireland to make a detailed report every six years on the conservation status of all listed species, including the hare. Ireland&rsquo;s most recent report in 2013 included a comprehensive assessment of the range, population status, habitat and threats for the Irish hare.  That report stated that the Hare is found throughout the country from coastal habitats to upland heath and bog. The Hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat niche. None of the identified threats were considered likely to impact on its conservation status in the foreseeable future and the Overall Conservation Status was assessed as Favourable.</p>  <p>  My Department has commissioned a new assessment of the status of hare&rsquo;s population in Ireland. The work to inform this population assessment has already begun.  The survey is using hundreds of camera traps deployed across all habitat types and in every county of Ireland.  The final report is due in mid-2019.</p>  <p>  Aviation safety is of paramount importance for any airport authority and all airports must manage hazards, including hazards presented by wildlife, to ensure the safety of airline passengers, their staff and the local communities. </p>  <p>  Wildlife safety risks associated with airports include the risk of ingestion by birds into an aircraft engine while on arrival, departure or close to the airport and the risk of a ground incident on or close to a runway where hares or other animals could be accidentally struck or otherwise killed which could result in further birds being attracted to the area.  </p>  <p>  Dublin Airport Authority has a strategy to deal with these issues.  In the case of birds, the primary method of control is through the growing of grass at a length which deters certain species, undertaking bird scaring activities or as a last resort, the shooting of a bird.  In the case of hares, the primary method of dealing with safety risk is through capture and relocation of the hares.  This is done in co-operation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  As licences are needed under the Wildlife Acts to capture hares, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has issued a number of permits in recent years under the Wildlife Acts to the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) to remove hares from the Dublin Airport airfield due to potential damage to aircraft and the threat to passenger safety.  It is understood that over the last 4 years in excess of 480 hares have been captured and released in this manner.</p>  <p>  I understand that following a serious safety incident involving hares in 2017, the Dublin Airport Authority decided that measures additional to catch and release were needed and that it would be necessary to cull some hares which were located in the grassy islands around the runway where it is considered that catches cannot be undertaken in these areas due to safety risks for persons involved as well as for passing taxiing aircraft.</p>  <p>  While the shooting of hares is permitted under the Wildlife Acts under the Open Seasons Orders during a certain prescribed period, licences are needed to shoot at night at any time.  The open season for hares is between 28 September and 28 February of the following year. The hare culls carried out by DAA were carried out during this permitted open season but my Department issued permits to the DAA to allow culling at the airport at night.</p>  <p>  Clearly the safety of the travelling public, the staff and visitors at the airport is of paramount importance and I&rsquo;m sure we all agree that one airline accident is too many.  While I expect the catch and release programme at Dublin Airport to continue, I will consider any applications to cull hares at night time having regard to the safety needs of all concerned. </p></reply>

There could however be a possibility that equipment or machinery would be encompassed within an overall project that fulfils the criteria of the scheme.  An example would be a museum in which such machinery was held.  The recent Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016 - 2018 is focused on the refurbishment and enhancement of the existing stock of arts and culture facilities throughout the country.  Funding of &euro;10.214m was allocated to 134 projects under three complementary grant streams. This is the most significant investment in cultural infrastructure in a decade with funding provided to a range of facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.  A full list of all successful projects is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.   </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 has given explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage and to our sustainable development by the unprecedented commitment by Government to invest &euro;1.2 billion over the next decade.  Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027 sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage. The plan sets out significant investment on a phased basis over the next 10 years including &euro;40 million to secure existing investment in arts and culture infrastructure nationwide and ensure a regional balance.  This infrastructure includes art galleries, museums, theatres and performance spaces, most of which is operated by our 31 local authorities.  These play an important role in supporting and enriching rural communities.  The Irish Museums Association estimates that there are approximately 230 museums throughout Ireland and these welcome over 6 million visitors annually.    </p>  <p>  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme is making a huge difference to many individual organisations and my Department is already seeing good outcomes and receiving positive feedback. My Department is currently giving consideration to new round of grant funding for Arts and Cultural Capital to be announced in the near future.</p>  <p>  I hope to be able to re-open the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme over the coming months.</p></reply>

Section 13 provides for the appointment of one of the members of the Board as Chair by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

In this regard, my Department offered to provide funding of up to &euro;250,000 to assist with the restoration and enhancement, in principle, to Cork County Council, pending clarity on all reinstatement issues including the contribution from insurances and subject to the acceptance by the Council of the conditions attached to this funding.  </p>  <p>  However, I understand that the County Council's re-instatement proposal is significantly more ambitious than the available finance and the Council has been in ongoing engagement with officials in my Department in relation to the project and this shortfall in funding. In this regard, there may also be other options open to the Council to close the funding gap.

The Government  also authorised the initiation of discussions on the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  It should be noted that the National Concert Orchestra will remain within RT&Eacute;.  </p>  <p>  The overall aim  of the Government decision in relation to the proposed transfer of the RT&Eacute; NSO is to enable the orchestra to be established as a world class orchestra which would, with the NCH, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that would greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government&rsquo;s Creative Ireland programme commits to a range of important initiatives to support culture and creativity in Ireland, and the Department's 10 year National Development Plan, envisages major capital investment in our National Cultural Institutions, including a major re-development of the National Concert Hall. The National Concert Hall since it opened its doors in 1981 has been the home of the National Symphony Orchestra which provides the backbone to the Hall&rsquo;s orchestral music programme. There is now an opportunity for the NSO to play an even stronger role as part of these wider developments and this should greatly enhance the offering of both organisations to the public.</p>  <p>  An Oversight Group has been established with formal terms of reference, with a view to identifying and addressing the relevant issues to enable the successful transfer of the NSO from the remit of RT&Eacute; to the remit of the NCH. The group has already met on two occasions.  In addition, a Working Group, as a subset of the oversight group, has been tasked at examining the detailed issues involved in the proposed transfer of the orchestra.  The issues to be examined include funding and I will not prejudge what proposals officials might make regarding funding.  </p>  <p>  At this point, it is considered that 2020 would be the earliest date for the completion of the proposed transfer.</p>  <p>  My Department welcomes the opportunity to work with all stakeholders including the members of the  RT&Eacute; NSO to ensure that it can contribute fully to Ireland&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage.</p></reply>

Our culture and heritage define who we are as a people, but they are also the reason many people visit and stay in Ireland. They are a priceless and irreplaceable national asset. </p>  <p>  Global Ireland - the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint to 2025 &ndash; includes key initiatives such as promoting Irish arts, heritage and culture to new generations and new audiences across the world. </p>  <p>  Culture Ireland, a Division of my Department operates on a cross Government basis with the Expert Advisory Committee comprised of representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, IDA and Tourism Ireland as well as representatives of the sector. My Department is currently in the process of organising a conference of cultural stakeholders to examine how best to establish curated and strategic cultural programmes that advance our global reputation. It is expected that the conference will be held in early 2019.</p>  <p>  Separately, I also recently announced a 4 month consultation on a new national heritage plan for Ireland, Heritage Ireland 2030. This consultation offers us a unique opportunity to rethink how we care for our habitats, landscapes, wildlife, historic buildings and monuments, so they can be celebrated and enjoyed long into the future. </p>  <p>  Our vision for heritage is a simple one - that heritage is valued and protected. Heritage Ireland 2030 is built around that vision: that the way in which we identify and protect our heritage is the best it can be. Heritage Ireland 2030 is built around three emerging themes - National Leadership, Stronger Heritage Partnerships and Communities and Heritage. It is intended to draw up an Action Plan under each theme with full, open and regular review of objectives over the lifetime of the Plan to 2030.  </p>  <p>  The Plan will serve to raise awareness and appreciation of the wonderful natural and built heritage that Ireland has to offer, and ensures its sustainability for this and future generations to come. </p></reply>

The current expenditure of the body is funded 85% by my Department and 15% by the Department for Infrastructure which reflects the distribution of the navigable waterways in each jurisdiction. Capital expenditure is funded 100% in the jurisdiction in which the capital works are carried out.</p>  <p>  The amount of funding allocated to Waterways Ireland from my Department's Vote for 2018 is &euro;24,106,000 made up of &euro;20,526,000 in Current and &euro;3,580,000 in Capital - an increase of &euro;1,148,000 on the 2017 allocation.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland focuses on delivering its core activities and maintaining front line services.  In 2018,  Waterways Ireland has concentrated the resources available on the areas of navigation which receive the highest levels of use.  A key goal for Waterways Ireland is to increase the use of the inland waterways. The number of registered users as of September 2018 stands at 15,479 with 95% of waters navigable during the boating season (mid-March to October)</p>  <p>   Waterways Ireland is proactive in the development of Blueways and Greenways as a means to attract new visitors and in response to the growth for recreational activities such as walking, canoeing and cycling.  It is also actively involved in the development of the towpaths along the canals to provide off-road, safe amenities for walkers and cyclists.</p>  <p>   The organisation provides services as diverse as physical maintenance of the infrastructure from navigation markers, sluices, back drains embankments, weirs and locks to service blocks, pump outs, and towpaths and carparks.</p>  <p>   Water management and control are important elements of the organisation's work together with provision of the Warden and Inspectorate service on each waterway to manage recreational use.</p>  <p>   Waterways Ireland provides navigation guides and information to support use of the waterways and has a strong community and business outreach and partnership policy to engage with and deliver services for communities adjacent to the waterways to create social, recreational, health and economic benefits.</p>  <p>   The inland waterways are an intrinsic part of the island's tourism attractions and Waterways Ireland plays a key role in their marketing and promotion. Working with Tourism Ireland, Bord F&aacute;ilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board it has created and leads initiatives such as the Lakelands and Inland Waterways programme to develop a co-ordinated marketing focus.</p></reply>

This plan provides for total investment of over &euro;1.2 billion over the next decade in our culture, heritage and language infrastructure.  Under this plan there is an indicative investment of &euro;80 million provided for this redevelopment project referred to by the Deputy which has been identified as a priority project by my Department. </p>  <p>  The current building is over 50 years old and is widely recognised as being deficient in the facilities it provides for artists, audiences and staff and in terms of its energy efficiency.  The new theatre building is intended to honour the history and legacy, whilst matching the national theatres of other European Capital Cities. The proposed new theatre will also contribute to revitalising a key area in Dublin 1, at the juncture of the two major Luas lines.  </p>  <p>  A business case was submitted to my Department in June 2018 that outlines the options for possible redevelopment of the theatre.  As the cost of the theatre Redevelopment Project is over &euro;20 million, a Cost Benefit Analysis will also need to be examined and reviewed by the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in the coming months as required under the Public Spending Code.  The completion of these reviews will be a further step in progressing this project.</p>  <p>  A number of high level meetings have taken place this year between the theatre and officials in my Department over this proposed redevelopment, including a meeting I had with the Chair of the Board of the  Theatre last summer to discuss the vision for the project. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also understand, that planning and construction of a facility as large and as costly as this project, must have a significant lead-in time.  The project is still at a very early stage but progress is ongoing.  Significant more work has to be undertaken before a clear time-line for this project emerges.  However, Officials in my Department are continuing to work with the Theatre to bring this project to fruition. </p></reply>

We do this on a national level, through the work of my Department and bodies under the aegis. We do this on a European level through legislation, programmes and initiatives, such as participation in this year's European Year of Cultural Heritage. Finally, we do this on an international level though membership of international conventions, such as the UNESCO 2003 Convention on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. </p>  <p>  Each country that ratifies the Convention is required to take the necessary measures to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage present in its territory. This includes drawing up a national inventory of the intangible cultural heritage, with the participation of communities, groups and relevant non-governmental organisations. Ireland ratified the Convention in 2015 and my predecessor approved an Interim National Inventory the following year, comprised of uilleann piping, hurling and harping. This was done in anticipation of a wider consultation for the nomination of traditions and practices that could be included in Ireland&rsquo;s national inventory. That consultation took place in late 2017 &ndash; early 2018 and attracted a wide range of expressions of interest for inclusion in the national inventory. My Department appointed an Expert Advisory Committee to examine the expressions of interest. That process is now completed and my Department is currently in the process of finalising the first inventory for my approval. The process is also rolling and interested communities or groups may submit an expression of interest at any time. </p>  <p>  Once the first national inventory is finalised, my Department will examine options for ensuring ongoing recognition and awareness of the traditions and practices on the national inventory.</p>  <p>  Items on the national inventory may be nominated to the UNESCO Representative List for the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. In 2017, Ireland nominated hurling, encompassing camogie, to the List. The nomination process is drawing to a close and the upcoming meeting at the end of November of the Convention Intergovernmental Committee will decide on whether hurling will be inscribed onto the Representative List.</p></reply>

Galway's designation as European Capital of Culture 2020, along with Rijeka, Croatia, is a great honour for Ireland and a wonderful opportunity to strengthen and promote our culture nationally and internationally.</p>  <p>  The Government's support of &euro;15m represents the largest single contribution to the overall cost of Galway 2020 as the European Capital of Culture.  The Government's contribution is provided as part of a suite of co-funding arrangements to deliver the programme outlined by Galway 2020.</p>  <p>  A performance delivery agreement for the provision of the &euro;15m grant to be paid to Galway 2020 was drawn up by officials of my Department, in consultation with Galway 2020, and signed on 6 November last.

These projects will be announced at a showcase event for Galway 2020 this evening and I intend to publish the full performance delivery agreement, together with this annex, on the Department's website, after the projects have been announced.</p>  <p>  Galway 2020 is now moving into the delivery phase of the project. Patricia Philbin &ndash; the Project Manager for the bid phase of the project &ndash; took over as CEO last month, while the team also now includes cultural producers, with expertise across the art forms.</p>  <p>  The showcase event to be hosted this evening, and to be attended by my colleague in the Department, Minister of State, Se&aacute;n Kyne, will be also an opportunity for the public to hear about some of the key projects and events that will take place under the Galway 2020 Culture Programme, as well as find out about and become involved in the volunteer and partnership programmes for Galway 2020.</p></reply>

This underwent a round of consultations, with submissions received from Government Departments, local authorities, and cultural bodies and stakeholders in the cultural sector, and was very useful in setting the scene for many of these bodies to develop their own cultural strategies. The draft framework policy was submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July 2016, who published its 'Report on Culture 2025 &ndash; &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, Framework Policy to 2025' in July 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department is now finalising the framework policy. In this regard, the Joint Oireachtas Committee made a number of very good suggestions including in relation to how the policy document should be reshaped. My Department has taken time to give careful consideration to these suggestions.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Creative Ireland Programme, which was launched in December 2016, restated the key aims and values set out in the draft Culture 2025 document but took these a stage further in terms of setting out key deliverable actions both in year 1 and over a 5 year period. In effect, the Creative Ireland Programme  has become the main implementation vehicle for many of the priorities identified in the Culture 2025. In this regard, the main emphasis of the Department during 2017 was to get the Creative Ireland Programme up and running. Since then my Department has been working to align the final Culture 2025 document with other concurrent policy documents, including the proposed new heritage plan for Ireland, Heritage Ireland 2030, the public consultation on which I launched at the start of this month.</p>  <p>  It is important however, notwithstanding the significant achievements under the Creative Ireland Programme, that Culture 2025 will remain as a broad overarching policy document for culture setting out the strategic aims of Government for future years. My intention is therefore to complete this work for final signoff very shortly and to bring Culture 2025 to Government for approval and subsequent publication.</p></reply>

Following an initial review by officials by my Department, 77 of these these were submitted to an independent expert panel for analysis and scoring against published set criteria. A total of 30 projects were ultimately approved for funding, with grants varying from a minimum of &euro;10,000 to a maximum of &euro;70,000.

I have also established an oversight steering group charged with the overall implementation of the plan's recommendations. This steering group has met three times since the action plan was published. The group includes representatives of all Departments and State agencies with involvement in the audiovisual industry.  The steering group will report to me at regular intervals and is engaging proactively with stakeholders in the film industry.</p>  <p>  The Plan drew heavily on a Study prepared by international audio-visual consultants Olsberg SPI with Nordicity entitled  Economic Analysis of the Audiovisual Sector in the Republic of Ireland which was also published in June. The report measured the economic value of the Irish audiovisual industry, and proposed policy changes to support its future growth.  The report showed that the Irish audiovisual sector generated &euro;1.05 billion in gross value added in 2016 and supported employment of 16,930 full-time equivalents of which 10,560 was direct employment.  The largest contribution to employment came from the film, TV, and animation sub-sector, which generated 11,960 full-time equivalent jobs (FTEs) of employment of which just over 7,000 was direct employment such as cast and crew.  </p>  <p>  F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann is the national development agency for Irish filmmaking and the Irish film, television and animation industry, investing in talent, creativity and enterprise.  I am glad to report that Screen Training Ireland, which is a division of F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann, plans to hold an inaugural Screen Industry Education Forum on the 19th November. The aim of this annual event is to bring screen industry stakeholders, education/training providers and policy influencers together to focus on the skills development challenges and opportunities of the screen sectors in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The audiovisual sector supports thousands of jobs of Ireland and there is significant potential for further growth in the years ahead.  Ireland&rsquo;s audiovisual and animation industry is currently worth more than &euro;1 billion to the Irish economy, and the audiovisual Action plan which I launched in June, set out under the Creative Ireland Programme, has the potential to not only increase the number of full-time industry employees to an estimated 24,000, but to grow its gross value to nearly &euro;1.4 billion.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has brought forward the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours.  This legislation responds specifically to the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to address the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work.  The Bill completed Report and Final Stage in the D&aacute;il on 12th July 2018.</p></reply>

This Plan sets out a number of measures to deliver on one of the key goals of the Creative Ireland Programme: to ensure that every child in Ireland has practical access to tuition, experience and participation in music, drama, art and coding by 2022. </p>  <p>  This Plan is being led by my Department, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council, all working in partnership.  </p>  <p>  The Creative Schools pilot will be operating across 150 Schools and approximately 50 Creative Associates, a mix of artists and teachers are working with these schools. These schools have approximately 38,000 pupils. There are a diverse range of school types involved, in different parts of the country, rural and urban, primary and post primary, DEIS schools, special schools, and Youthreach centres.  2018/2019 is the pilot for Creative Schools and it is hoped to expand the programme in the coming years.</p>  <p>  There are 73 schools participating in Creative Clusters and they have been grouped into 23 clusters and there are 17 facilitators working with these clusters, through the Education Centres.  There are approximately 17,000 students, from a diverse range of school types, in these schools.  These clusters have a budget to bring in local artists to facilitate their chosen creative projects and may choose to bring in more than one artist.  It is also hoped to expand on this programme in future years.</p>  <p>  The Teacher/Artist Partnership, for primary school teachers, has taken place over the last number of years and between the summers of 2017 and 2018, 469 teachers and 146 artists took part in this CPD course.  These teachers, in collaboration with the artists took their expertise back to their respective schools, and the pupils in these schools have benefited from their partnerships.  It is hoped to build on this over the coming years.</p>  <p>  Many schools collaborate locally with artists, creative practitioners and others in various fields.  Children and young people across the country benefit greatly from these collaborations.  The local Arts Offices, and indeed the Creative Ireland Coordinators in each local authority, are integral to ensuring that these collaborations grow and continue and are allowed to flourish.</p></reply>

The sale and any apportionment of the property into lots is a commercial matter for the vendor.</p><p>Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country including a large area of County Wicklow, and the 5,000 hectares of lands in Glenasmole purchased in recent years. Given the limited resources available for capital investment within the National Parks and Nature Reserves, I recognise the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves' lands.</p><p>While the lands in question would represent a significant addition to the stock of publicly owned heritage properties and lands, my Department could, as stressed previously, only consider acquiring this property if the price fell to within a certain range,<b></b>or in the context of a donation or bequest. This is known to the Vendors. Clearly, the Glenasmole purchase of 5,000 hectares sets a precedent, and although the circumstance pertaining are very dissimilar, it is certainly a market factor. As the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, it would not be appropriate of me to seek to negotiate indirectly or publicly. Suffice it to say that I am aware of the public-good value of this property, balanced across a range of demands across my Department. </p><p>As I said in my earlier replies, my Department's relationship with the Guinness Estate here, and more generally, has been positive. It is one of mutual respect and good neighbours, and indeed often working together on shared issue of interest. These include herd management and husbandry, habitat oversight, film-making, signage, visitor accommodation, trail maintenance and designation management. Indeed, for the most part, the boundary between the private estate and the National Park is invisible to the visitor and tourist, with pre-imminence being given to the idyllic shared land, lake and mountainscape.</p></reply>

A total number of 287 applications were received in respect of the fund, far exceeding expectations.  Following an initial review by officials by my Department, 77 of these these were submitted to an independent expert panel for analysis and scoring against published set criteria. A total of 30 projects were ultimately approved for funding, with grants varying from a minimum of &euro;10,000 to a maximum of &euro;70,000.

Earlier this year, I joined with Minister Murphy and with the Taoiseach to launch Culture and the Creativity Strategies of all 31 local authorities.  These strategies were jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  </p><p>Local government legislation has specific provision enabling local authorities to promote arts and culture within their functional area.  While I appreciate that some groups have called for the law to be changed to make it a requirement for arts funding to be non-discretionary I am not convinced that this would make a difference to expenditure on the ground. All local authorities already make provision for expenditure in the arts. A mandatory provision would not change the level of funding provided as councillors would still continue to balance expenditure proposals across all local authority programmes as is currently the case. It is far better in my view for local authorities to embrace cultural and artistic provision because they see the transformative engagement which the arts and culture can bring to local communities. I think that the experience of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme and now the Creative Ireland Programme have been instrumental in raising awareness at local government level of the value of this engagement.</p><p>For my part I will work to improve the resources which flow to local authorities through the Arts Council and through the Creative Ireland Programme in partnership with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>The Taoiseach has declared his intention that he is committed to doubling funding for arts, culture and sport over a seven year period. The Government is already delivering on this objective. Last April we launched <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage, </i>a 10 year capital plan which will support cultural infrastructure nationwide.</p><p>Under 2019 Budget funding for the arts and culture sector in 2019 will increase by &euro;22.6m to almost &euro;190m which represents an increase of 14% on 2018.  This funding will comprise of &euro;148.2m in current expenditure and &euro;41.7m in capital investment.  In the context of the Deputy's question, this includes an increase to the Arts Council funding by almost &euro;6.8m or 10% to a total of &euro;75m made up of &euro;6m in current expenditure, which is more than double the increase in 2018.</p><p>I am glad to report that Creative Ireland will receive funding of &euro;7.15m &ndash; an increase of &euro;1.15m primarily to support the Culture and Creativity Teams established in every local authority and to allow for the continued roll-out of Creative Youth.  A total of &euro;6m is being provided for the European City of Culture &ndash; Galway2020 and an additional &euro;250k for the Decade of Centenaries for commemorations was also announced. </p><p>I am confident that the increased spending and continued engagement will support  Pillar 2 of the Creative Ireland Programme, where local authorities are the primary instruments of community engagement for of the Programme entitled<i>Enabling Creativity in Every Community throughout Ireland</i>. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s audiovisual and animation industry is currently worth more than &euro;1 billion to the Irish economy, and the audiovisual Action plan which I launched in June, set out under the Creative Ireland Programme, has the potential to not only increase the number of full-time industry employees to an estimated 24,000, but to grow its gross value to nearly &euro;1.4 billion.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the Irish Government commissioned international audio-visual consultants Olsberg SPI with Nordicity to produce a report on "Economic Analysis of the Audiovisual Sector in the Republic of Ireland" which was also published in June. The report measured the economic value of the Irish audiovisual industry, and proposed policy changes to support its future growth.  The report showed that the Irish audiovisual sector generated &euro;1.05 billion in gross value added in 2016 and supported employment of 16,930 full-time equivalents of which 10,560 was direct employment.  The largest contribution to employment came from the film, TV, and animation sub-sector, which generated 11,960 full-time equivalent jobs (FTEs) of employment of which just over 7,000 was direct employment such as cast and crew.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has brought forward the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours.  This legislation responds specifically to the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to address the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work.  The Bill completed Report and Final Stage in the D&aacute;il on 12th July 2018.</p>  <p>  I am also glad to report that Screen Training Ireland, which is a division of Screen Ireland, plans to hold an inaugural Screen Industry Education Forum on the 19th November. The aim of this annual event is to bring screen industry stakeholders, education/training providers and policy influencers together to focus on the skills development challenges and opportunities of the screen sectors in Ireland. </p></reply>

Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that &euro;20.04m is to be allocated to F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann under  Budget 2019. This is an increase of &euro;2 million on the 2018 figure .  </p>  <p>  F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann also supports the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  It also liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise opportunities for the promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions as well as a tourism destination.</p>  <p>  In April of this year, I was joined by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in launching Investing in Our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027.

In June 2018 I launched my Department&rsquo;s &euro;200m Audio-visual Action Plan.  The industry-wide, long-term plan, under the Creative Ireland Programme, will support the Government&rsquo;s ambition to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of Film, TV drama and animation.</p>  <p>  This Plan is informed by and accompanied by the publication of the Olsberg/SPI with Nordicity Report which sets out a detailed economic analysis of the audiovisual sector and provides an invaluable framework for the growth of the industry over the coming years. </p>  <p>  A steering group has been set up which will prioritise measures, oversee implementation and monitor risks, and will report regularly to me as Minister.</p>  <p>  I am glad to report that Budget 2019 also included an announcement that Section 481 which is the Irish tax incentive for film, television and animation has been extended to 2024.

The impact of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme had a transformative effect and led to the development of the Government's Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022.</p>  <p>  The Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022 was launched in December 2016 as the legacy programme of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme and as the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in Culture 2025. The Creative Ireland Programme was underpinned by the aims and key values of Culture 2025.</p>  <p>  As these two documents were developed at the same time they have naturally informed one another. The Culture 2025 Draft Framework Policy, which was published in July 2016, stated that the publication of the policy would be followed up with the development of a cross-sectoral plan which would be guided by the priorities set out in that document.</p>  <p>  In reality the Creative Ireland Programme was developed as an action plan and therefore it is the intention that implementation of many of the goals and aspirations set out in the final Culture 2025 document will be carried out under the Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that Culture 2025 will give overall direction to future iterations of the Creative Ireland Programme as well as guiding the Government's approach to culture policy across all sectoral areas. </p>  <p>  With this in mind, my Department is putting together the final version of the Culture 2025 document, which will be completed in the coming weeks and brought to Government for approval and subsequent publication. This final version has been restructured to ensure coherence with the development of the Creative Ireland Programme over the past two years, and other developments in the cultural area, and to clearly distinguish between the high level policy Culture 2025 framework and the more action orientated Creative Ireland Programme.</p></reply>

It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m in total for this Scheme in 2018. In 2017 and 2018 a total of &euro;100,000 was provided in grant aid under this scheme for 28 projects in County Kildare. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. I have allocated &euro;1.3m for the Structures at Risk Fund nationally in 2018. Over the course of 2017 and 2018, a total of &euro;119,000 was allocated to 5 projects in County Kildare under this scheme. Details of the projects approved under both funding schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and on local authority websites. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund will be revamped for 2019 and will become the Historic Structures Fund. The Fund will open for applications shortly, together with the Built Heritage Investment Scheme for 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2018 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s funding to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) provides for the maintenance, development, management and operation of the NPWS. It includes running costs of the 6 National Parks and 80 statutory Nature Reserves, development and improvement works for visitor facilities and other minor capital projects. NPWS also funds conservation-related research and surveys and compensatory measures for landowners&rsquo; costs and losses resulting from restrictions in managing their land in areas designated under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives.  There are small provisions for supporting small scale conservation and community education and awareness projects in areas affected by the cessation of domestic turf cutting on designated raised bogs, the operational costs of the Peatlands Council and also for the scanning costs of applications referred to the Minister in her role as a statutory consultee under the Planning Acts and from other consent authorities.</p>  <p>  Ireland, like all EU Member States, is bound by the requirements of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.</p>  <p>  Significant efforts have been made by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the Habitats Directive.  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022 sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. Measures for turf-cutters affected by the cessation of turf-cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas also include the provision of compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme which is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.</p>  <p>  15,673 annual payments and 1,076 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of applications received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation. 1,207 annual payments and 2 deliveries of turf have been made to applicants from raised bog natural heritage areas under the scheme. In addition, 1,870 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made, of which 48 relate to natural heritage areas.</p>  <p>  The affected special area of conservation raised bogs in Kildare are Mouds Bog SAC and Ballynafagh Bog SAC for those sites 933 annual payments and 313 deliveries of turf have been made together with 65 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500. My Department is in the process of relocating applicants from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation to the non-designated Coolree Bog. Approximately &euro;103,000 has been spent on progressing this project.</p>  <p>  In 2018 I announced the approval of grant funding of just under &euro;137,000 under the pilot Peatlands Community Engagement Scheme for twelve local community groups and organisations for a variety of projects focused on the conservation and revitalisation of raised bog Special Areas of Conservation, Natural Heritage Areas and other raised bog areas in 2018.  A grant of &euro;3,900 was awarded to an organisation in Co. Kildare for restoration works to a raised bog natural heritage area in Co. Meath.</p>  <p>  In terms of future funding, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years, as part of Project Ireland 2040. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

A total of 30 projects were ultimately approved for funding, with grants varying from a minimum of &euro;10,000 to a maximum of &euro;70,000. Cumulatively, the total funding being made available to support these projects across 2018 and 2019 amounts to approximately &euro;1.2m. </p><p>The purpose of the National Creativity Fund is to develop strategic collaborations<b></b>with a variety of organisations/individuals in order to identify and develop new initiatives that support the broad objectives of the Creative Ireland Programme and help inform policy and/or cross-sectoral development in the area of culture, creativity and wellbeing. </p><p>Two projects in Galway are being supported under the Fund. The Galway University Hospitals Arts Trust Limitedwill be rolling out a comprehensive programme of exhibitions, events, and public engagement for and with the hospital community across Ireland&rsquo;s largest geographical Hospital Group - the Saolta University Health Care Group, over the next twelve months. This will include workshops, public performances, the development of a strategic arts policy for the Saolta University Health Care Group, a series of arts interventions in public spaces, a month long pilot for a poet doctor programme and a 6-month artist residency pilot.</p><p>The Galway Childcare Committee and Groundswell Arts will pilot &lsquo;The Lullaby Project&rsquo; which will partner professional musicians with parents, carers, and early years practitioners to compose bespoke personalised songs for young children in three diverse early years settings. The project will build on Galway&rsquo;s strong musical traditions and raise the profile of how music in early years can support and nurture children, increase wellbeing, support inclusion and build lasting relationships with families.</p><p>Full details on the projects supported under the scheme are available on the Creative Ireland Programme website .</p></reply>

By the end of 2017 (the latest date for which figures are available), the Department had reduced it's energy consumption by 25%.  Under the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) the Department is committed to further reducing its energy consumption and to improve energy efficiency by 33% by 2020.  </p>  <p>  The energy consumption reduction achieved to date is as a consequence of participating in a number of programmes. My Department participates in the SEAI Public Sector Energy Efficiency Programme and engages in the Optimising Power @ Work campaign under the auspices of the OPW.  In line with the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy 2017 an Energy Performance Officer has been appointed, at Assistant Secretary level, to provide leadership and accountability in reaching the NEEAP targets. Efforts towards improving energy efficiency have been achieved through proactive departmental energy teams who are implementing energy efficiency initiatives such as using only energy efficient lighting, more strict control of heating and ventilation systems, organising Energy Awareness Days to improve behaviour by staff at desk level, installing timers on high energy units, regular energy audits and monitoring and reporting etc.  It's also worth noting that the Department HQ uses a renewable resource, wood pellets, as its main heating system rather than depending on fossil fuels. To date the efforts of our energy teams have been recognised by the OPW under the Optimising Power @ Work campaign with the receipt of numerous awards, including most recently 2018 Regional Best Energy Team and 2018 Regional winners of the Outstanding Achievement Category. </p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to make every effort and will continue to strive to be more energy efficient to reach the ambitious 2020 target by continuing to implement existing initiatives in a proactive approach in order to improve energy efficiency. In addition its energy teams will continue to meet on a regular basis to devise and implement new energy saving initiatives. </p></reply>

These measures will take effect from 1 January 2019.  </p>  <p>  The rate of betting duty at 1% on the amount of bets wagered in Ireland is at an all-time low, and betting duty receipts are exceptionally low when compared to other sectors subject to excise taxes. It is also the case that there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. With the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 now well embedded in, I believe it is timely to increase the rates of Betting Duty and Betting Intermediary Duty.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that advances in technology have challenged existing business models and have changed the structure of many markets, including the betting market, with more betting taking place online. I further acknowledge that smaller bookmakers may have ongoing difficulties competing in that environment or indeed with large retail bookmakers. While I have sympathy for small bookmakers I cannot apply the increase to some bookmakers and not others. Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters.   </p>  <p>  I should point out that my Department held a consultation with the sector last year asking if the current model was appropriate and the overwhelming response was that it was. The main focus of the sector's engagement during this consultation was to oppose any increase in the betting duty, which leaves me with few options in this regard other than to impose a straight forward increase in the current regime. </p>  <p>  My Department very recently received a proposal from the sector advocating for a change to a gross profit tax model. This is something I am willing to consider in the context of Budget 2020, notwithstanding concerns brought to my attention about the compatibility of this proposal with EU rules and the greater capacity within the model to reduce overall betting duty receipts. </p>  <p>  Finally, we must also acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers. This needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.</p></reply>

The evident energy performance deficits have been compensated to some degree by bodies under the aegis of my Department who have more scope to engage in infrastructural upgrades and deep retrofits.  In order to achieve continuous improvements in energy performance, significant projects in my Department and across the wider Public Service Bodies may be required to reach 2020 and 2030 targets.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged with OPW&rsquo;s Architectural and Engineering Divisions on identification of projects that will assist in achieving additional energy efficiencies and it is an active participant in the Office of Public Works (OPW) &ldquo;Optimising Power @ Work&rdquo; campaign.</p>  <p>  My officials will be facilitating a Working Group comprehending the Department's State Bodies, the intention of which will be to reaffirm our commitment to our obligations and the adherence to best practice in energy management across the Group.

During its consideration, representatives from the Working Group engaged with the Office of the Attorney General to explore whether it was considered legally and constitutionally permissible for the Oireachtas to enact legislation to delimit or cap the amount of damages which a court may award in respect of personal injuries. </p><p>On foot of those engagements, the ultimate conclusion reached by the Working Group was that (i) introducing such a measure would constitute a significant development in the law, because any legislation which restricts the rights of citizens must be carefully considered and justified to ensure it would withstand constitutional challenge, (ii) that the main question for a court, if such a measure was challenged, would be whether an appropriate balance was struck having regard to the exigencies of the common good, and (iii) that the appropriate balance can only be struck once all appropriate factors have been taken into account by the Houses of the Oireachtas in considering the legislation. </p><p>Due to the complex legal nature of this subject, the Working Group concluded that it was not in a position to undertake the in-depth analysis of all of the issues that would be required to demonstrate to a court that the correct balance of constitutional rights and principles has been struck having regard to the exigencies of the common good.  Consequently, the Working Group took the view that the appropriate forum to consider this matter would be the Law Reform Commission and made a recommendation addressed to the Department of Justice and Equality to that end (Recommendation 5) in the Working Group&rsquo;s <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>, published in January 2018. </p><p>Pursuant to Recommendation 5, the Department of Justice and Equality provided a comprehensive submission to the Law Reform Commission requesting that research and analysis be carried out on the issue of whether it is (i) justifiable and in the common good and (ii) legally and constitutionally permissible for the Oireachtas to enact legislation to delimit or cap the amount of damages which a court may award in respect of personal injuries.</p><p>The Law Reform Commission has confirmed that their draft Fifth Programme of Law Reform contains a project aimed at examining whether it is appropriate to legislate for a cap to be placed on the levels of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injury claims. It is expected that the Programme will be finalised by the end of this year.</p><p>In conclusion, nothing will be decided on this issue, including in relation to a referendum, until the Law Reform Commission has reported on the matter, but all options remain open.</p></reply>

While there has been a considerable improvement in the overall economy and mortgage market since then, for example overall arrears have fallen and new lending has increased, it is accepted that the financial crash continues to impact on the mortgage market and that problems still remain. One of the legacy issues which remains is the current high level of concentration in the Irish mortgage market. </p>  <p>  One of the ways to address this, as highlighted by President Draghi, is to further promote financial integration at a European level. The EU Mortgage Credit Directive has been a positive move in this direction as it provides for the first time a common minimum set of rules across the EU in relation to the provision of residential mortgage credit to consumers. This directive was transposed into Irish law in 2016 by the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations. More generally, President Draghi, indicated that the completion of banking union and the development of a more integrated capital market would better enable financial service providers to more easily transact and provide financial services across borders. </p>  <p>  The issue of standard variable mortgage rates is a significant one for this Government, and it is committed to efforts to reduce the cost of secured mortgage lending and to promote competition in the supply of mortgage finance. The Government is of the opinion that increased competition is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole, but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending. The Government will encourage and support moves made by any new lender who wants to enter the market and offer new sources of credit to borrowers. </p>  <p>  Also the cost of mortgage credit is an issue that the Government keeps under active review in its ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and the Central Bank.  Lenders are now offering an increasing diverse range of variable interest rate mortgage products and savings can be made by borrowers with their existing mortgage provider, in particular as they build up equity in their property, or by more actively considering options to switch mortgage provider. Recent enhancements have been made to the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code in order to better facilitate the mortgage switching process between lenders (which will come into effect from January next) and also to require lenders to provide information to their borrowers on their other mortgage products that could provide savings to their customers at that point in time. </p></reply>

It notes that overall, the Department's Energy Group, which comprises 9 bodies, including the Department itself, has achieved 33% energy savings to end 2016.  This was more efficient than the baseline set and is on track for the 2020 target.  The Department&rsquo;s own energy saving of 69% is also on track for the 2020 target and has been achieved mainly by measures such as behavioural changes and better energy management and space utilisation. </p>  <p>  The Department shares its Merrion Street headquarters with the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance undertakes the facilities management functions for both Departments in these premises and the reply in respect of that Department sets out the specific energy efficiency initiatives being undertaken there.  </p>  <p>  The majority of DPER staff outside of the Merrion Street complex are already located in energy efficient buildings or have recently moved to one and consequently there is no scope or requirement to make adjustments to them in terms of engineering solutions, retrofits, thermal glazing options and building envelope insulation etc. to achieve further significant energy efficiencies. However, the Department hopes to achieve some further improvements by continuing to embed energy efficiency into the culture of the organisation and by progressing energy awareness campaigns across its main locations. </p>  <p>  The Department will also continue to contribute to the implementation of the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy, in conjunction with the bodies under its aegis, the Department of Finance, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the SEAI.  </p></reply>

The outcome of the review will be finalised and made available as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  This review will include an assessment of the extent to which projected needs in the area will be met from the additional capacity being provided by the projects already approved and how any specific additional needs will be best catered for, recognising the importance of maintaining a balance between existing and any additional school provision.</p></reply>

I understand the concerns being expressed by the people of Drogheda and other areas of Louth and this type of criminal behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of Garda resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. However, I am advised that Garda management keeps the distribution of these resources under continuous review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources in Drogheda, and indeed in all parts of the country.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific incidents referred to by the Deputy, I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are conducting full investigations into each case and as such it would be inappropriate for me to comment while these investigations are ongoing. </p>  <p>  However, I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Garda&iacute; have put in place a policing operation to prevent, detect and mitigate against any further escalation of violence. In addition to cancelling all Garda leave in the Louth Division for the next two weeks, the operation will entail high visibility patrols, supplemented by personnel from the Regional Armed Support Unit; Community Policing Units; District Detective and Drug Units and Divisional Roads Policing Unit.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have further advised that they will continue to make every effort to disrupt the activities of any groups who may be involved in these incidents, to arrest and prosecute offenders and deny access to the road networks for those involved. </p>  <p>  In relation to drug related crime, it is important to say that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains resolute in its determination to act against those within society who pose a significant threat to the welfare and well-being of our citizens and the communities they serve.  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime.  The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other state agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard.  Liaison is also ongoing between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant stakeholders, including the Local Authorities and Tusla / HSE to name but a few.</p>  <p>  For its part, the Government is firmly committed to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ensuring that the organisation is appropriately resourced.  The resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with provision made in Budget 2019 of more than &euro;1.6 billion, including an allocation of &euro;95 million for overtime.  </p>  <p>  It is also the case that the unprecedented investment now being made in Garda ICT infrastructure of &euro;342 million between 2016 and 2021 will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver on reform, work more efficiently and deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in delivering professional policing and security services for the community.</p></reply>

To that end, I recently published a report reviewing the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system to ensure our policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.  The report confirms that our employment permits system is largely robust with some adjustment required to ensure continued responsiveness, setting out recommendations to be addressed over the short, medium and long term that will ensure that our employment permits system will play its part in supporting Ireland's labour market needs.  </p>  <p>  In order to have an occupation considered for addition to the HSEOL, or removed from the ICEL, there would need to be a clear demonstration of current recruitment difficulties and shortages across the EEA and that difficulties are not as a result of other factors such as salary, employment conditions or lack of upskilling opportunities.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed evidence-based case requesting the additional of an occupation to the highly skilled list would then need to be put forward by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as the lead Department for the sector, to my Department for review and consideration. This evidence-based case model was used successfully recently by the agri-food sector in demonstrating the difficulties experienced and the efforts made by that sector in sourcing labour from the EEA.</p></reply>

We continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness and analyse the factors that are crucial to attracting further investment in the country.</p><p>The World Bank Ease of Doing Business 2019 report compares the &lsquo;ease of doing&rsquo; business in 190 economies using quantitative indicators. The report assesses the impact of 11 areas of business regulation: starting a business; dealing with construction permits; getting electricity; registering property; getting credit; protecting minority investors; paying taxes; trading across borders; enforcing contracts; resolving insolvency; and, labour market regulation.</p><p>In the latest report, Ireland achieved a high score of almost 79, which compares favourably with the top performing economy in the 2019 report, New Zealand, which achieved an absolute score of 86.5. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s score means that it is the 23<sup>rd</sup>highest ranked economy in the world, the 8<sup>th</sup>highest ranked in the EU, and the 5<sup>th</sup>highest ranked in the Euro Area. Ireland&rsquo;s continued high score, and high ranking, in the ease of doing business report is also reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic growth, our trade performance, and the falling unemployment figures. </p><p>Looking at a more granular breakdown of the ease of doing business score, Ireland ranked highly in certain indicators, including &lsquo;paying taxes&rsquo; (4<sup>th</sup>), &lsquo;starting a business&rsquo; (10<sup>th</sup>), and &lsquo;protecting minority investors&rsquo; (15<sup>th</sup>). </p><p>However, there is no room for complacency. The ranking is also a reminder of the intense global competition Ireland faces for exports and inward investment. Areas for focus are highlighted in other indicators, including &lsquo;getting electricity&rsquo; (43<sup>rd</sup>), &lsquo;trading across borders&rsquo; (52<sup>nd</sup>), and &lsquo;enforcing contracts&rsquo; (102<sup>nd</sup>). Though the report did note that Ireland had made enforcing contracts easier by introducing a consolidated law on voluntary mediation. </p><p>Global uncertainty and Brexit has underlined the importance of ensuring strong productivity growth in Irish-based industries, a competitive advantage vis-&agrave;-vis our trading partners, and generating an uplift in enterprise export competitiveness to secure sustainable jobs and growth. </p><p>Ensuring enterprise stays at the forefront of innovative activity is vital to deepening the resilience of our enterprise base and necessary for success in global markets, which for a small open economy like Ireland, is necessary for creating sustainable growth. Building the foundations of future growth means we must further enhance the competitiveness of our business environment that should take into account the World Bank ease of doing business ranking. </p><p>My officials and the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) will establish what actions we can take to further improve our competitiveness, particularly in the areas where we are lagging competitors. The NCC will advise Government on specific actions to take in its forthcoming 2018 Competitiveness Challenge report.</p><p>In addition, the Future Jobs initiative &ndash; which is being led by my Department and the Department of An Taoiseach, to be published in early 2019 &ndash; will have a strong focus on improving productivity in the economy and its competitiveness.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, it must first submit an application to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the 2016 Framework Agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), whether to add the medicine to the reimbursement list, agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse it.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that at the recent bi-annual meeting between my Department and the Irish Healthcare Pharmaceutical Association that this proposed dialogue was discussed.  It is envisioned that this will take the form of a structured platform of engagement, building a stronger partnership between the State and industry to create better patient access to new treatments.</p></reply>

There are socially excluded groups who experience extreme health inequalities. Such groups include Travellers homeless people, refugees and asylum seekers and people with addiction issues. Inequalities in health are reflected in the mortality and morbidity rates of the population. Rates of chronic diseases are another indicator of health inequalities. A social gradient is also apparent in mental health. Reducing health inequalities can delivery real benefits for society and for future generations. It requires interventions to address the social determinants of health and to provide integrated and comprehensive healthcare services.</p><p>The health needs of Travellers' are documented in the landmark All Ireland Traveller Health Study, published in 2010 and funded by the Department of Health.  </p><p>The Department of Health, through the HSE, provides funding in the region of &euro;10m per annum for programmes to improve the health situation for Traveller communities. These include: </p><p>- primary healthcare projects, counselling services, family support programmes and men's health projects; dedicated public health nurses and related staff; </p><p>- mental health promotion and suicide prevention services in a culturally sensitive manner, to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.  </p><p>A further &euro;500,000 funding is provided through the Dormant Accounts Fund for initiatives aimed at improving Traveller mental health.  </p><p>The Department recently convened a workshop on Traveller health needs.  This involved representation from various policy units in the Department of Health, Community Healthcare Organisations within the HSE and Traveller organisations.</p><p>As Minister with responsibility for health promotion and social inclusion, I am very aware of the health inequalities experienced by Travellers. Significant measures have been undertaken across the health service to address these inequalities and there is ongoing and extensive engagement with Traveller organisations. I am committed to providing funding to address the acute health needs of Travellers, within the budgetary resources available.</p></reply>

This new function will deliver a standardised approach to validation across all hospitals in line with best patient-centred practices. Other benefits of the new function will include the identification of patients on waiting lists who are ready and available to proceed with hospital care, the reduction in the Did Not Attend rate (DNA), and an improvement in information for managing waiting lists.

At the same time, a more challenging efficiency target of 33% was set for the public sector to demonstrate leadership on energy efficiency.</p><p>The 20% improvement in energy efficiency by the public sector towards its target of 33% by 2020, has been achieved based largely on low-cost behavioural change measures. </p><p>The Department of Health has been working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Energy, the SEAI and the OPW via the Optimising Power at Work Programme on energy efficiency measures.</p><p>In the most recent data available &quot;Health&quot; is shown as having achieved 17% savings to date and &ldquo;not on track to achieve the target&rdquo;. However, it should be noted that this relates to the Health Sector as a whole, and not just the Department. The HSE has been working to address energy usage, particularly in Acute Hospitals - which are among the biggest energy users in the Sector.  To put this in context, one large-scale project could deliver significant savings that would achieve the target on behalf of the entire sector.</p><p>In relation to the Department, it has been participating in the OPW &ldquo;Optimising Power at Work&rdquo; scheme since 2007. This is the baseline year. Overall energy consumption in Hawkins House for the period 2017 v 2007 has shown an increase of 7.1%. This is primarily explained by a substantial increase in gas consumption over the year. A 33.3% increase on the base year was evident. This reflects the condition of Hawkins House and the adverse weather conditions over the period.</p><p>Electricity consumption continued to perform well, at the end of 2017 a saving of 26% was achieved. <table><tr><th>Description</th><th>Electricity </th><th>Gas</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Benchmark Year</td><td>1,140,467 </td><td>1,452,118 </td><td>2,592,585 </td></tr><tr><td>Previous 12 Months </td><td>839,484 </td><td>1,936,005 </td><td>2,775,549 </td></tr><tr><td>% Difference </td><td>-26.4% </td><td>33.3% </td><td>7.1% </td></tr></table></p><p>Department continued with a range of initiatives to improve energy performance including:</p><p>- Improvements from &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; initiative - with a particular focus on all PCs being shut down at 10pm nightly, if they have not already been shut down by the user.</p><p>- Monitoring of time clocks on mechanical and electrical systems.</p><p>- Monthly energy reporting.</p><p>- BMS (Building Maintenance System) Maintenance.</p><p>In July 2018, the Department moved to an A rated Building Energy Rating (BER) accommodation in Miesian Plaza and it is expected that this will have a positive impact on the target going forward. This should be most evident by the end of 2019 when the Department can compare full-year data in relevant categories.</p></reply>

This is further emphasised by future Brexit issues.  I have been actively engaging with my European counterparts on this issue.  Along with counterparts from France, Spain, Finland, Portugal and Greece, we have called for the restoration of the CAP budget for the 2021 &ndash; 2027 period to current levels.  Up to 20 Member States have joined this alliance and we will continue to work together in an effort to build consensus on this point.  I recognise that to achieve the best outcome, we need to seek common ground with like minded Member States.  Ireland will continue to seek to build alliances as the negotiations for the next CAP and its budgetary allocation progress and I will continue to fight for a strong CAP budget. </p>  <p>  As regards the CAP legislative proposals themselves, the European Commission&rsquo;s objective is to have the proposals adopted by the co-legislators in spring 2019, prior to the European Parliament Elections in May that year.</p>  <p>  The Austrian Presidency scheduled an intensive programme of Working Party meetings to discuss the CAP proposals during its Presidency.  These meetings have been ongoing since July, with up to 20 Working Group meetings having taken place so far.  Further meetings are scheduled throughout the remainder of this month and into December.  The Presidency is currently working on revisions to reach overall agreement.</p>  <p>  In addition, the CAP Post 2020 has been discussed at the Special Committee of Agriculture meetings on a regular basis.  CAP post 2020 has also been a standing agenda item at every Agri-Fish Council meeting.  I had the opportunity to discuss the CAP proposals at our last meeting on 15 October, which looked at the performance framework and the new greening architecture.  The CAP proposals will also be discussed at the next Agri-Fish Council meeting on Monday next, 19 November, with the focus being placed on the increased responsibilities of Paying Agencies and Certification Bodies under the new delivery model, and, the appropriateness of existing market support measures.  </p>  <p>  From the European Parliament&rsquo;s perspective, COMAGRI is expected to discuss the three draft reports on the future CAP at Committee level, when they meet on 21 November in Brussels, with the deadline for amendments set for 3 December.  It is suggested that the amendments for legal &amp;amp; linguistic revision would be sent by 7 December and then on for translation by 11 December, to be ready in early January 2019.  COMAGRI is aiming to vote on the amendments on 18/19 February, while the second session in March 2019 (25-28) has been set as the &ldquo;deadline&rdquo; for a plenary vote. </p></reply>

The ASSAP involves a resource of 30 Agricultural Sustainability Advisors, 20 of whom are funded by Government and 10 by the Dairy Industry. These Advisors will promote on-farm best practice to farmers in 190 &lsquo;Areas for Action&rsquo;, which have been identified by the EPA where the status of the water is at risk of regressing. Farmers can avail of this service within the &lsquo;Areas for Action&rsquo; on a voluntary basis. </p>  <p>  Advisors have now received comprehensive training to ensure a common approach. The process of engagement with both the wider communities and with farmers in these areas is now underway. Community meetings are taking place in the &lsquo;Areas-for-Action&rsquo; to update the wider communities on developments in the local areas; 15 such community meetings will take place before the year end. Furthermore farmer focused meetings will take place subsequent to the community meetings providing the opportunity for engagement with farmers in these areas.  It is important to note the very strong support from all those involved in farming for the programme; this support is crucial in communicating and informing farmers about the ASSAP programme and facilitating farmer engagement.  </p></reply>

There are three separate regulations, details of which are outlined below:</p>  <p>  - Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 on the application of de minimis aid in the agriculture sector &ndash; aid granted under this Regulation does not need to be notified to the European Commission.  Aid can only be granted to undertakings active in the primary production of agricultural products.  The individual ceiling is set at &euro;15,000 over a three year rolling period, while the national ceiling is set at &euro;66,280,000 over a rolling three year period.</p>  <p>  - Commission Regulation (EU) No 702/2014 &ndash; the Agriculture Block Exemption Regulation.  This Regulation applies to micro, small and medium sized enterprises active in primary agricultural production and the processing and marketing of agricultural products.  Aid granted under this Regulation must be notified to the European Commission, through a simplified notification procedure.  The aid intensity can vary from 100% of the eligible costs being paid to 40%, depending on the particular measure under which a scheme operates.  There are no specific ceilings per se under this Regulation, however, individual aid which exceeds &euro;7.5 million for certain measures or &euro;500,000 for other measures would not be eligible to receive aid.  Aid in excess of these amounts would need to be notified under the European Union Guidelines for State Aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas. </p>  <p>  - The European Union Guidelines for State Aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas applies in principle to SME&rsquo;s and large enterprises active in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products resulting in another agricultural product and the marketing of agricultural products.  Aid granted under these Guidelines requires full notification to the European Commission.  Notification thresholds under the Guidelines start from &euro;7.5 million.</p>  <p>  As outlined in my reply to PQ No 194 of 8 November 2018, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has responsibility for the general de minimis regulation 1407/2013.</p></reply>

This increase is expected to continue as eir proceeds to pass and connect further premises every month and as awareness of the availability of high speed broadband improves and retailers offer a choice and variety of communications packages over the network.</p></reply>

This included amendments to section 71. </p><p>Given the possibility that some UK based broadcasters will look to establish a base in Ireland following Brexit, it is considered that the current provision should be amended in anticipation of this possibility. At present, section 71 broadcasters are not subject to paying the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) levy. Section 71 is, however, the only way in which new entrants, including traditional linear broadcasters, can establish themselves to provide broadcasting services in Ireland. This amendment, therefore, proposes to amend the levy provisions to allow for the possibility of bringing section 71 broadcasters within the scope of the BAI levy.</p><p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment considered the amendments under Pre-Legislative Scrutiny and published their report on March 8<sup>th</sup>. The Bill is currently being drafted by Parliamentary Counsel and is included as a priority on the Government's Legislative Programme.</p><p>Should a broadcaster establish itself in the State by obtaining a section 71 licence, that broadcaster would be subject to the advertising rules and codes provided for in the Broadcasting Act 2009.</p></reply>

The strategy is clear that non-renewable energy sources will make a significant &ndash; though progressively smaller &ndash; contribution to our energy mix over the course of the energy transition. The National Mitigation Plan, published in July 2017, restates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to move from a fossil fuel-based electricity system to a low-carbon power system. Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and on-going review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.</p><p>During this transition, gas has the potential to deliver significant and sustained benefits, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply. Natural Gas has the potential to play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more CO2-intensive fossil fuels.  In Ireland gas powered generation also provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the LNG project to which the Deputy refers is a private commercial project and any future investment decisions on the development of this project are a matter for the project promoter.</p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is independent in the exercise of its functions and a copy of its decision in relation to the Shannon LNG project is on the An Bord Plean&aacute;la website.</p></reply>

All Public sector Bodies are legally required to report their energy performance annually to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  The Monitoring and Reporting (M&amp;amp;R) System, established by SEAI on behalf of my department, enables public bodies and schools to track their energy efficiency performance and facilitates them in their energy management.  </p><p>The most recently published data (available from SEAI <i>Annual Report 2017 on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance</i>) covers the period to end 2016.  It shows that my department had by then achieved a cumulative 19.9% energy improvement.  In 2017, the department launched the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy (PSEES) which was approved by Government to support the additional effort needed to meet the 33% target.  The Group my Department heads comprises 16 bodies, including the Department itself, is one of the strongest performing groups, having achieved 31% energy efficiency to end 2016.</p><p>This improved energy performance in my department was achieved by:</p><p>- participation in the OPW Optimising Power @ Work (OP@W) initiative;</p><p>- introduction of a Building Management System to enable better energy monitoring and management;</p><p>- upgrading the heating system in the Department's HQ building to allow for zonal targeting and switch off during holiday periods;</p><p>- rollout of energy efficient networked printers and photocopiers;</p><p>- upgrading  to more efficient LED lights, where appropriate;</p><p>- insulation works in part of our HQ building;</p><p>- energy awareness days and efficiency notices displayed throughout the buildings.</p><p>Further energy efficiency opportunities will be identified as part of a recent energy audit under the OP@W initiative.  This should provide a basis to deliver further energy efficiency improvements.</p><p>I fully expect that when the figures for 2017 are published later this month they will show a further significant efficiency improvement for the department.  Based on progress to date I remain confident that my Department and its Group will be successful in achieving the 2020 target.  We will also continue to work with other Departments through the Governance structures set up under the PSEES, with the assistance of SEAI and the OPW, to provide guidance and support to the Departmental Energy Performance Officers and their groups to manage their performance so that the overall national target can be achieved.</p></reply>

This is above the target set at 33% by the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy 2020. </p>  <p>  During 2017, my Department reduced its energy consumption by putting procedures in place such as enabling automatic computer shut down in the evenings, reducing lighting in areas of the building with reduced footfall, the removal of personal heaters and desk fans, the central heating system set on a timer for 'exception periods' for dates when the building was closed on weekends and Bank Holidays. My Department also provided energy awareness information sessions to staff.</p>  <p>  I expect my Department's energy efficiency performance to further improve as a result of the move in early 2018 to Miesian Plaza. Miesian Plaza is designed for high energy efficiency and is expected to achieve LEED Platinum accreditation. LEED, (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is the most widely used green building rating system in the world.</p></reply>

First, we have deployed additional staff to process the tasks and respond to the customer enquiries.  Second, we have developed some new IT processes that address the payment gap issues and to ensure a faster flow-through to payments.  Third, we are reviewing the design rules in the system to afford greater flexibility in processing of claims and certificates.</p>  <p>  Payment volumes were restored to normal levels last week and my officials are monitoring them on a daily basis to ensure that they remain at this level. Any further issues that may arise will be dealt with as they are identified. In addition to these system issues, the Department acknowledges that it did not communicate effectively with customers.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that we learn from the lessons of this experience, I have arranged for an independent review into how the changes to IB were planned, implemented and &ndash; importantly &ndash; communicated to customers.  I expect this work to be completed by the end of the year.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to sincerely apologise again for the difficulties and frustration experienced by customers who did not receive the correct IB payment or who experienced delays in their payments over the last few weeks. </p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age, subject to the relevant criteria.</p>  <p>  It is well known that people are living for much longer.  Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly over the years &ndash; and is now at 78.4 years for men and 82.8 years for women.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

YESS will aim to provide jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive  environment while on a three-month placement, which may be extended to six months if certain conditions are met. During the placement, participants will be paid a weekly YESS allowance by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The total weekly YESS personal rate of payment will be &euro;229.20 per week.  Participants whose underlying entitlement is in excess of that amount will continue to receive their current entitlement plus a top-up allowance of &euro;22.50 per week</p>  <p>  Participants on the YESS may engage in education and training provided by the placement host, or part-time education and training courses, irrespective of length and provided that it does not have an adverse impact on the placement. </p>  <p>  Participants on the YESS will be eligible to avail of the Training Support Grant (TSG) of up to &euro;500 on two occasions during a 12 month period where deemed necessary.  This will also apply to jobseekers who are engaged with JobPath and who go on to pursue a YESS placement.</p>  <p>  The scheme will provide a supportive structure for participants, including case officer support for both placement hosts and jobseekers. A Learning and Development Plan will be agreed between the placement host and the participant at the outset of the placement. The Plan will include a range of personal development skills as well as any specific &lsquo;work&rsquo; skills that will be acquired during the placement and which are based on the advertised vacancy. The placement host will complete a reference for the participant at the end of the placement.</p>  <p>  A DEASP case officer will be the key liaison person for both the placement host and the participant.  The case officer will be available for support throughout the placement and will regularly review the progress of same.  This will include a formal review meeting after 2 months, which will also facilitate the case officer in deciding whether to approve a request for an extension of the placement duration to 6 months, if an extension has been requested.  The case officer will also provide post-programme supports to the participant for up to six months after the placement ends.</p>  <p>   The option of an employer contribution was examined by my department; however, an employer contribution would result in the contract between the placement host and the participant becoming one of employment rather than a placement, which is not the purpose of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  YESS is co-funded by the Irish Government, the European Social Fund and the Youth Employment Initiative as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020. Exchequer funding for YEI-supported activities is matched by separate YEI and ESF contributions. Therefore the total allocation of &euro;16m for YESS is made up of approximately &euro;5.333m in Exchequer funding, with matching allocations from ESF and YEI funding. As with all ESF-supported activities in Ireland, YESS is fully funded upfront by the Exchequer and applications for reimbursement of relevant expenditure are submitted to the European Commission in arrears.</p></reply>

The Scheme has been established under the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan) Regulations 2018, which also provide that I as Minister issue a Statutory Credit Policy. The purpose of the Policy is to set out in more detail the eligibility criteria for obtaining a loan and procedures to be followed by local authorities in considering loan applications. In addition the Housing Agency has been given the task of carrying out assessment of the loan applications on behalf of the authorities and making recommendations in respect of each application.  Each local authority must have in place a credit committee and it is a matter for the committee to make the decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the Regulations and Statutory Credit Policy, having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  In line with best practice, I have asked my Department to undertake a review of the operation of the Scheme. The review will have regard to the advice from local authorities, the Housing Agency and Housing Finance Agency, and will also take account of the issues raised by Dail Deputies over the last 9 months. However, in making any recommendations in relation to the operation of the Scheme, the review will also have to take account of the need to ensure that lending issued under it is provided on a prudential basis, so as to protect the financial interests of the local authorities.    </p>  <p>  The most recent figures for the scheme, as at the end of October, indicate that the Housing Agency had received a total of 3,309 applications for assessment since the scheme was launched in February.  Of these, 619 were deemed invalid, while the assessment of 107 others was still in progress.  Of the remainder, a total of 1,317 applications, or 51% of the total valid number assessed, had been recommended for approval.</p></reply>

Part 5 contains significant detail on the procedures and operation of the new affordable purchase Scheme and it will be supported by associated Regulations and Guidance, which are close to finalisation following extensive consultation between my Department, the Housing Agency and local authorities.  Last week, my Department hosted a workshop for all local authorities on affordable housing and local authority land activation issues.</p>  <p>  In order to deliver affordable homes, in the areas of the country most affected by a lack of affordable housing supply, the Government has committed &euro;310 million, over the 2019-2021 period under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).  It will fund key facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. </p>  <p>  All local authorities are currently undertaking economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites. A second call for proposals under the Serviced Site Fund will be made as soon as is practicable and the scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities, as part of the aforementioned economic assessments, which they have been requested to submit by 30 November.</p></reply>

My Department is engaged in consultations with the Office of the Attorney General to scope out, with the benefit of information provided by DES on the purpose built student accommodation (PBSA) sector, the legal feasibility of introducing related amendments in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018 as it passes through the legislative process in the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that certain PBSA, provided by the private sector, let rooms on the basis of tenancy agreements that are registered with the Residential Tenancies Board. Other private PBSA providers let their student rooms on the basis of licensing agreements which are not classified as a tenancy and, therefore, are not within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016.   </p>  <p>  If there is any doubt as to the type of agreement in place in respect of individual dwellings, for example whether it is a tenancy or licence, the matter should be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for a determination.  </p>  <p>  It is important that the design of any new regulatory system to be introduced is mindful of the pressing need to secure the delivery of the pipeline of PBSA development in train and does not deter future necessary investment in the sector, given the critical importance of increasing the supply of rental accommodation for students and achieving a more balanced supply/demand position.</p></reply>

The Department advised that it could not support the granting of permission in 5 cases and appealed 2 grants of permission to An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la. </p><p>In responding to planning referrals, archaeological recommendations are made in line with national policy on the protection of the archaeological heritage as appropriate to the circumstances in each case. My Department's practice in all cases is to seek the inclusion of suitable conditions or design changes rather than recommending refusal which would only be considered as a last resort.  This is evidenced by the small number of cases where the Department has indicated that it is not in position to support a grant of permission or has found it necessary to appeal against a planning approval.</p></reply>

Its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.</p><p>Under Pillar 2 - 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community' of the Programme, in 2018, my Department allocated a sum &euro;2m and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government allocated a sum of &euro;1m to all 31 local authorities (&euro;96,000 each approximately) to enable them support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county. To date in 2018, over 500 different initiatives around Ireland have been funded under Pillar 2.  These include arts projects, grant schemes, concerts, conferences, exhibitions, festivals, outreach projects, publications, research programmes, and workshops among other activities. They cover topics such as archaeology, architecture, biodiversity, crafts, heritage, dance, film, history, literature, music, photography, poetry, storytelling, theatre and the visual arts.</p><p>These activities form part of each local authority's five-year Culture &amp;amp; Creative Strategies which were launched by me, An Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on the 12 September. </p><p>These strategies highlight the critical role our Local Authorities play as providers and enablers of cultural and creative experiences in communities across Ireland, with all of the vitally important social, and indeed economic, consequences that follow. The strategies recognise that the arts and creative endeavours are crucial to society and community growth. With collaboration and shared purpose at the heart of the Creative Ireland Programme, each strategy provides meaningful opportunities for people and their communities, together with each Local Authority, to build and nurture a creative society. All the strategies and the activities supported under the strategies are available online at .</p><p>As part of the Creative Ireland Programme, this year I launched Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g - a national day of creativity for children and young people which took place on 23rd June.  Hundreds of free events and activities took place right across the country and specific funding was allocated to each local authority to roll-out this programme in their communities.</p><p>Culture Night took place on 21st September and saw venues and public spaces across the island of Ireland open their doors to host a programme of free entertainment, as part of an all-island celebration of arts, heritage and culture. </p><p>In addition to funding directly from my Department, the Arts Council also provides significant supports for the Arts at local level.</p></reply>

Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. </p><p>The decision as to whether a building is placed on, or removed from the Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the relevant local authority. My Department does not keep a record of derelict or semi-derelict sites across the country, nor does it keep heritage sites under review generally, except where these sites are national monuments in State care or otherwise part of the historic national heritage estate which is managed by the Office of Public Works. </p><p>As Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am the owner or guardian of almost 1,000 national monuments in State care right across the country, ranging from prehistoric burial monuments to medieval fortifications and religious sites. Sites in my ownership or guardianship are maintained by the Office of Public Works. Conservation matters in relation to these sites are managed through regular liaison between the OPW and my Department, identifying condition issues and proposing appropriate conservation actions, carried out under consent where relevant. </p><p>My Department is providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2018 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, archaeological excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care. </p><p>Financial support for owners and occupiers of historic buildings is provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes.  &euro;2m has been provided for the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2018 and 370 projects have been approved for funding. &euro;1,324,000 has been provided for the Structures at Risk Fund 2018 and 76 projects across the country have been approved for funding.</p><p>The Structures at Risk Fund will be revamped for 2019 and will become the Historic Structures Fund. The Fund will open for applications shortly, as will the Built Heritage Investment Scheme for 2019.</p><p>Details of the projects approved under both funding schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and on local authority websites. Projects approved include a wide variety of types of structures with many different uses, both private and public. </p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage. It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p><p>In terms of future funding, <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 </i>represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years, as part of Project Ireland 2040. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p><p>The public consultation for Heritage Ireland 2030, which I launched on 1 November and which is open until the end of February 2019, gives everyone the opportunity to have their say on the future of our heritage and to help identify the priorities for &euro;285 million identified in Project Ireland 2040 for investment in our built and natural heritage. </p><p>There are four ways that people can engage with this consultation and have their say: by logging on to my Department&rsquo;s website and completing the short survey at www.chg.gov.ie/heritage/heritageireland2030; by email to heritageireland2030@chg.gov.ie; by participating in local events and workshops that will be rolled out over the coming weeks; or by post to Heritage Ireland 2030, The Custom House, Dublin 1, D01 W6XO. </p></reply>

Its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.</p><p>In 2018, under Creative Ireland Pillar II - <i>'Enabling Creativity in Every Community'</i>, my Department allocated a sum &euro;2m while the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government allocated a sum of &euro;1m to the 31 local authorities (&euro;96,000 each approximately) to enable them support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county.  To date in 2018, over 500 different initiatives around Ireland have been funded under Pillar II.  These include arts projects, grant schemes, concerts, conferences, exhibitions, festivals, outreach projects, publications, research programmes, and workshops among other activities. They cover topics such as archaeology, architecture, biodiversity, crafts, heritage, dance, film, history, literature, music, photography, poetry, storytelling, theatre and the visual arts.</p><p>These activities form part of each local authority's five-year Culture &amp;amp; Creative Strategies which were launched by me, An Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on the 12 September. </p><p>Additional funding of approximately &euro;650k was allocated to the local authorities in 2018 to enable them deliver Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g on 23 June 2018 which celebrated and encouraged children and young people&rsquo;s participation in culture and creativity through performance, coding, theatre, art and music workshops, readings, screenings, special events and much more.  A sum of &euro;350k was allocated to Dublin City to deliver Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g and a sum of &euro;300k divided among the remaining 30 local authorities or &euro;10k each. It is estimated that over 300 specific separate events took place for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g across the country. It is my intention to establish Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g as a yearly celebration of creativity among children and young people. </p><p>In addition to the above, the following initiatives are supported by my Department: </p><p>- My Department also supports Culture Night with venues and public spaces across the island of Ireland hosting a programme of free entertainment, as part of an all-island celebration of arts, heritage and culture. Culture Night took place on Sep 21st 2018.</p><p>- Annual funding of &euro;1.6m is provided to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;) in 2018 for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture. CC&Eacute; provides weekly classes at community level in all traditional instruments, singing, and dance through its network of centres and branches all over the country. </p><p>- My Department provides funding for the purchase of equipment under the Music Capital Scheme to performing groups and individual talented musicians nationwide.  Support of &euro;224,000 was recently under Scheme for 2017/18. The Scheme is managed by Music Network on behalf of my Department.</p><p>- Culture Ireland, provides supports for Irish artists and musicians to travel abroad and develop their careers.</p><p>- The Cultural Schemes Unit of my Department arranges a number of schemes including the Cooperation with Northern Ireland Scheme, the Mobility of Collections Scheme, the Regional Exhibition Schemes and the Small Local Festivals and Summer Schools Schemes.  Details for the 2018 Schemes may be found at   It is anticipated  that these schemes will re-open for applications in Q1 2019. </p><p>- The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016 - 2018 is focused on the refurbishment and enhancement of the existing stock of arts and culture facilities throughout the country.  To date, funding of &euro;10.214m has been allocated to 134 projects under three complementary grant streams. This is the most significant investment in cultural infrastructure in a decade with funding provided to a range of facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces. The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme is making a huge difference to many individual organisations and my Department is already seeing good outcomes and receiving positive feedback. My Department is currently giving consideration to new round of grant funding for Arts and Cultural Capital to be announced in the near future.</p><p>- The Arts Council also has a number of schemes and initiatives around the support of music and drama. Details of these can be accessed on its website at the following link: <i>www.artscouncil.ie</i></p><p>- Scoileanna Ild&aacute;nacha/Creative Schools is a flagship initiative of the Creative Ireland Programme to enable the creative potential of every child. Creative Schools is led by the Arts Council in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Creative Schools draws on the commitments set out in the Arts in Education Charter. Creative Schools will give expression to this goal as part of an integrated implementation plan for arts in education. Creative Schools  aims to understand, develop and celebrate the arts, as a core aspect of school life, and to foster children and young people&rsquo;s creativity and participation in the arts as an integral part of their education in Ireland.  It will establish a range of collaborative opportunities for schools and will develop and strengthen the relationships between schools and the broader cultural and community infrastructure within which they operate. The long-term aim is for every school to be supported to fully embrace the arts and creativity, ensuring a positive experience and strong outcomes for children and young people. </p></reply>

This trend has been particularly pronounced in recent years with some excellent examples.  In particular, I would highlight the film <i>Brooklyn,</i>the TV drama series <i>Vikings</i>, <i>The Young Offenders</i>which is both a film and TV drama series and of course <i>Star Wars: Episode VII &ndash; The Force Awakens </i>and <i>Star Wars: Episode VIII &ndash; The Last Jedi.</i></p><p>F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann is the national development agency for Irish film making and the Irish film, television and animation industry.  Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that &euro;20.04m is to be allocated to F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann under Budget 2019. This is an increase of &euro;2 million on the 2018 figure.  </p><p>F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann also supports the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  It also liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise opportunities for the promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions as well as a tourism destination.</p><p>F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann also offers practical support and information for film makers in accessing skilled crew and studio and technical infrastructure. The Inward Production team provides ground logistical support and advice on filming in Ireland.
