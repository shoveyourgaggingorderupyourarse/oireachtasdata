    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-09a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019050900054#WRA00600"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with competition law, neither I nor my Department have any role in determining market prices for any commodity, nor can I intervene in this particular process.</p>  <p>  The Irish dairy market, following on from broader EU and international trends, is currently in a much improved position compared to the relatively recent past during the period 2014 - 2016. Of course, my Department remains extremely vigilant in monitoring the current market and emerging trends, particularly as we approach the peak period for Irish milk production.</p>  <p>  The average milk price paid to Irish dairy farmers in 2018 was 34 cent per litre, which was higher than the average price paid across the EU of 33 cent per litre. More recently, the milk price in Ireland has been higher than 33 cent per litre during the early months of 2019.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland exported dairy products to approximately 140 countries totalling over &euro;4.5 billion worth of produce, an increase of over 5% by volume compared to 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, are playing a key role in building the market for Irish dairy with intensive Ministerial trade mission programmes and other promotional activities.  I will lead a trade mission to China next week, including a significant focus on dairy.</p>  <p>  While the overall dairy sector is now in a much better place, particularly at the farm gate, the issue of intervention stocks of skimmed milk powder overhanging that particular market was a cause for concern in recent years, arising from the significant recourse to this market measure for skimmed milk powder across the EU from September 2015. However, figures from the European Commission show that there are now only approximately 1,000 tonnes of SMP remaining in public intervention stock, with over 370,000 tonnes having been sold out of intervention since March 2018.</p>  <p>  I have clearly stated previously, at Council of Ministers meetings and elsewhere, that it is imperative that the Commission remains vigilant in monitoring the market and that it has contingencies in place in the event of market volatility re-emerging in relevant markets, particularly the raw milk, butter and skimmed milk powder markets.</p>  <p>  Whilst challenges have continued throughout recent years, in particular price volatility, the long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong, and the Irish dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand.</p></reply>

This work has taken on greater importance as we seek to reduce our exposure to the UK market in the light of the UK's decision to leave the European Union. In discharging its responsibilities, Bord Bia works closely with my Department, and this ongoing co-operation has in turn been reflected strongly in the whole-of-Government approach to Brexit.</p>  <p>  I have allocated significant additional funding to Bord Bia since the UK referendum in 2016 in the context of managing the response of my Department and its agencies to Brexit. Following an initial allocation of &euro;1.6m in 2016 to allow Bord Bia to directly assist food companies with significant exposure to the UK market, further increases in funding over the last three budgets have brought Bord Bia's total allocation in 2019 to &euro;46.6 million. This represents a 60% increase in funding for marketing and promotion of our food offering since 2014.</p>  <p>  The initiatives undertaken by Bord Bia include direct advice to companies through individual consultations and seminars, and the completion of a Market Prioritisation exercise that has identified the best prospects for sustainable growth across individual sectors and is also now informing both Bord Bia's and my own Department's activities for example in relation to Trade Mission destinations.</p>  <p>  Bord Bia has also undertaken its largest ever recruitment drive to employ 29 new staff to support the growth of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink industry. Most of these positions will be based across continental Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia, with some also located in Bord Bia&rsquo;s Dublin office. Indeed, this expansion mirrors my own Department's plans to expand its presence internationally.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agrifood and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013), as well increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.</p>  <p>  However, it is also important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  In light of the on-going depressed market prices, I have, in discussions with Commissioner Hogan and my EU counterparts, said that I believe that the deployment of exceptional measures under the CMO Regulation, to provide targeted aid to farm families who have suffered a sustained reduction in returns from the market, is now required. I made an intervention to this effect at the April meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and my officials have followed this up with a detailed submission, which is under consideration by Commission officials.</p></reply>

The Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agrisector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.</p>  <p>  In 2018, total live exports of cattle increased by over 30% to 246,000 head compared to 2017. This represented a value of &euro;110 million to the Irish economy, according to Bord Bia. This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports of cattle totalling 163,000 up to the 28th April &ndash; a 28% increase on the same period in 2018.</p>  <p>  My decision in 2017 to reduce the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 has brought greater equity to the inspection fee regime. Since then there has been continued growth in the export of calves, rising from 102,000 head in 2017 to 159,000 in 2018 &ndash; a 56% increase. According to the most recent Bord Bia figures for 2019, calf exports already stand at 123,000 head, with consignments to the Netherlands and Spain accounting for 50% and 31% of this trade, respectively.</p>  <p>  This increase in trade is also apparent with regard to the export of non-calves (weanlings, stores and finished cattle), which are approximately 23% up on last year, according to Bord Bia&rsquo;s most recent statistics.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to prioritise efforts to deepen existing markets and gain access to new third country markets.</p>  <p>  Just this week, my Department hosted a visit by a Turkish technical team, including officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and ESK (the Turkish Meat and Milk Board). The objective of the visit was to conduct an on-site fact-finding mission to evaluate the technical aspects of live animal and germinal product exports from Ireland to Turkey. This is yet another welcome development as we seek to re-establish our live trade with Turkey. The visit by Turkish officials follows on from my March meeting with my Turkish counterpart, Dr Bekir Pakdemirli, Minister for Agriculture and Forestry.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the progress made on live exports to Algeria arising from the technical meetings between my Department and Bord Bia and their counterparts in Algiers last week. The Algerian authorities have agreed in principle to move from a joint breeding, slaughter and fattening certificate to 3 separate certificates. In addition, there is agreement for the maximum age of breeding animals to be raised from 36 to 42 months. My technical experts will now move quickly to oversee the changes to the health certificates for live exports so that they can be forwarded to our Algerian colleagues for their imprimatur prior to the commencement of the revised trade conditions.</p>  <p>  With regard to other third country markets:</p>  <p>- A number of consignments of cattle have left for Libya in recent weeks, the most recent on the 3rd of May, carrying approximately 2,400 head.</p>  <p>- In April, my Department reached agreement with the Egyptian authorities on three proposed health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle. </p>  <p>- I met with the Kazakh Ambassador in late March to discuss new health certification for the trade of live animals to Kazakhstan. Progress was made in relation to opening the Kazakh market.</p>  <p>  With regard to animal welfare, my Department maintains robust oversight of live trade, through a comprehensive legislative framework, and in my recent meetings with exporters, I have stressed the importance of high animal welfare standards. Irish legislation on sea transport is recognised by the European Commission as being among the most effective and stringent legislation in force on transport by sea.  With regard to road transport, the Department does not approve journey logs from exporters for any live export where the destination country has an orange or red weather alert in place, or where a significant part of the transit route goes through an orange or red alert area. This is in addition to the annual ban on road transport of livestock to Greece, North Africa and Turkey during the months of July and August.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department continues to proactively contribute to efforts to improve animal welfare standards during transport.  My Department is currently providing multiannual funding of &euro;75,000 per year over four years to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) towards the implementation of the second Action Plan of the OIE Platform on Animal Welfare for Europe, in relation to slaughter and transport, within Europe and between Europe and the Middle East and North Africa.</p></reply>

This will provide a more accurate and robust sheep traceability system in support of animal health and public health objectives and thus support the further development and sustainability of the sheep industry.</p>  <p>  My officials are working very closely with marts and slaughter plants to ensure that as many of these premises as possible will operate as CPRs with effect from 1st June.  It is my understanding that the major sheep processing slaughter plants are making significant progress in this regard. Marts are similarly well disposed to operating as CPRs and are proactively engaging with the CPR process with a view to having facilities in place at the earliest opportunity.  I accept that the upgrading of mart facilities to CPR standards will be an incremental process and I expect that a significant number of marts will be in a position to operate as CPRs in a relatively short period.</p>  <p>  Where it is not feasible for marts to upgrade their facilities to CPR requirements, farmers can continue to move sheep to these premises by either printing out the tag numbers of the sheep to be moved for attachment to the relevant dispatch document or by continuing to record the individual number of each sheep presented to a non-CPR mart on the dispatch document.</p>  <p>  The extension of EID to all sheep will further enhance traceability across the sheep sector and will assist in the Government's efforts to maintain and expand the export markets for Irish sheep meat. I will be visiting China later this month and Japan in June to build on the efforts made to date in pursuing market access and increasing market opportunities in line with Food Wise 2025 and our response to Brexit.</p></reply>

EU Regulations pertaining to the National Reserve provide that the two categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; must receive priority access to the Reserve.  In the context of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, Ireland consulted with the EU Commission regarding the possibility of including the Forgotten Farmer group under the specific disadvantage category of the 2017 National Reserve. The EU Commission confirmed that Member States could not use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund a specific disadvantage category of the National Reserve.</p>  <p>  The Commission confirmed at the time that the only funding option for the specific disadvantage category was natural replenishment of the Reserve, such as from unused entitlements or the proceeds of clawback, but only after the two priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; had been catered for.</p>  <p>  EU Regulation 2393/2017 (Omnibus Regulation) came into effect in January 2018 and introduced a new possibility for the inclusion of &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; categories such as Forgotten Farmers into the National Reserve. From 2018 Member States may use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; categories of the Reserve, but only if a linear cut is required to fund the two priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; in that particular year.  As there was sufficient funding available in the National Reserve in 2018 and 2019 from natural replenishment of the fund in order to cater for the two priority categories, the issue of a linear cut did not arise.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve, including the basis of funding the Reserve, are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which comprises members of the main farming organisations, farm advisory and education services.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agrifood and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013), as well increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.</p>  <p>  However, it is also important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  In light of the on-going depressed market prices, I have, in discussions with Commissioner Hogan and my EU counterparts, said that I believe that the deployment of exceptional measures under the CMO Regulation, to provide targeted aid to farm families who have suffered a sustained reduction in returns from the market, is now required.  I made an intervention to this effect at the April meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and my officials have followed this up with a detailed submission, which is under consideration by Commission officials.</p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agrifood sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025. It is crucial that we all continue to work together. I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including the development of Beef Producer Organisations.</p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector.  I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to beef farmers under the RDP, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.</p></reply>

The Terms of Reference of the Review Group were:</p><p>(i) To review fur farming in Ireland taking into account existing legislative provisions for the licensing of mink farming </p><p>(ii) To comment on the economic benefits of the sector </p><p>(iii)To consider the effectiveness of existing welfare controls, and </p><p>(iv) To make appropriate recommendations </p><p>The Review Group invited submissions from the public and interested parties and considered over four hundred submissions which were received.</p><p>The Group considered whether the farming of fur animals in Ireland should be banned and concluded that it did not find the arguments in favour of this compelling and recommended that instead, fur farming be allowed continue under licence and subject to official control.</p><p>In addressing welfare concerns, the Group made a series of recommendations.  At operational level, it recommended that the level of DAFM Veterinary and Agricultural inspections and controls be strengthened, to include unannounced inspections so that additional confidence can be gained in respect of compliance with animal health, animal welfare, environmental requirements, greater security on the farms and contingency planning.  It also recommended that veterinary controls should include a review of the checks carried out by the private veterinary practitioner engaged by the licence holders.</p><p>On foot of the Review Group&rsquo;s deliberations, my Department introduced more rigorous controls on licence holders in the areas of animal welfare, animal accommodation, security and nutrient management.  Licensees are subject to regular inspections, including unannounced inspections by Department officials.</p><p>The controls in this area are therefore robust and in particular there is a focus on ensuring high animal welfare standards are maintained on these farms.</p></reply>

Irish food products have a highly rated and hard earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets all over the world.</p>  <p>  The Irish cereals sector plays a significant role in the supply of high quality grain to the feed industry, providing raw material for the food and drinks industry and is a key source of seed production.</p>  <p>  Cereals are therefore a significant stakeholder in our agrifood industry from a supply/food safety and sustainability viewpoint and the continuance of an efficient and viable tillage sector in Ireland is vital. My Department continues to provide significant supports to the sector under the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II, the EU Protein Aid Scheme and the fodder production incentive measure introduced in 2018.</p>  <p>- The Tillage TAMS scheme supports tillage farmers adoption of more efficient and sustainable practices by supporting the purchase of items such as GPS guidance and cover crop establishment equipment.  </p>  <p>- My Department also provides a high quality official crop seed certification scheme to the industry.</p>  <p>- The &euro;3m coupled Protein Aid Scheme has encouraged the production of beans and peas, which reduces our dependence on imported protein feeds, while giving growers the option to adapt more sustainable crop rotations. In spring 2018 I announced the continuation of the Protein Aid Scheme for 2019 and I envisage it remaining for the period of the current CAP.</p>  <p>  The Strategy for the development of the Organic Food Sector, which was launched by my colleague Minister of State Andrew Doyle, recognises the opportunities that exist for the Irish Organic Food Sector and provides clear direction for the development of the Sector up to 2025. It aligns the strategic growth plans of the Organic Sector with the broader Food Wise 2025 Strategy for food and drink.</p>  <p>  The overall strategic objective is to develop a consumer-led viable Organic Food Sector in Ireland enhancing the sustainability credentials of Irish food which will produce a wide range of organic products to meet increasing domestic and export market opportunities. To this end, this Strategy sets measurable strategic objectives for each sub-sector and incorporates actions considered essential to further support the industry&rsquo;s development and achieve growth targets.</p>  <p>  In respect of dairy, in 2018, Ireland exported dairy products to approximately 140 countries totalling over &euro;4.5 billion worth of produce, an increase of over 5% by volume compared to 2017 and another year of strong performance by the Irish dairy sector.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, are playing a key role in building the market for Irish dairy with intensive Ministerial trade mission programmes and other promotional work. I am delighted to acknowledge that Kerrygold has achieved over &euro;1 billion in annual sales globally.</p>  <p>  According to the CSO, Ireland exported almost &euro;3.9 billion worth of meat with a volume of over 1 million tonnes in 2018. My officials continue to work towards opening and enhancing access to as many markets as possible. This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. As you are aware, Irish food products are stocked in all major retailers across the globe.</p>  <p>  Preparations for a new agrifood strategy to 2030 are underway. Its development will involve an analysis of a range of cross-cutting themes and the various sub-sectors of the agrifood industry; a formal public consultation; and the establishment of a committee to develop the strategy.</p>  <p>  Without pre-empting the work of the new committee and the eventual content of the 2030 strategy, it is clear that consideration will have to be given to the production systems of animal and plant products from our livestock, cereal and horticulture sectors as well as customer and consumer demands.</p>  <p>  Quality Assurance plays a fundamental role in promoting food and horticulture and provides the platform for consumer promotion of product quality. Bord Bia operates a series of quality assurance schemes for the food industry. The schemes are built on best practice in farming and processing, current legislation, relevant industry guidelines and international standards - and are accredited to the ISO17065/2012. They are reflected in the high level of trust placed by consumers in QA labels.</p>  <p>  As I stated earlier, premium quality is the cornerstone of all Irish agrifood products and the measures I have outlined will serve to maintain and enhance our enviable reputation throughout the world into the future.</p></reply>

Under the proposed BISS, there is a mandatory requirement for Member States to ensure that, by 2026, all payment values reach a minimum convergence level of 75% for all payment entitlements.   Member States will also be required to set a maximum value of individual payment entitlements.  It is proposed that the funding mechanism will be similar to the current system where payment entitlements with values above the average are reduced to fund the convergence.</p>  <p>  This proposal builds on the current convergence path of the 2015-2020 CAP Regulations, under which all entitlements must reach a minimum value of 60% of the national average by 2019.  I am open to some further convergence in payments.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the draft CAP Post-2020 regulations by Commissioner Hogan in June 2018, officials from my Department have been engaging with European colleagues and analysing the effects of all of the proposed changes, including changes to convergence.  This close level of engagement and detailed analysis of the impact of the proposals on farmers in Ireland will continue until the Regulations are fully developed. The outcome of these continued discussions and the results of these analyses will inform the decision-making process on the implementation of CAP Post-2020 in Ireland.</p></reply>

The total number of loans progressed to sanction at bank level is 117 to a value of &euro;25.1m, 23 of which relate to food businesses to a value of &euro;7.4m.</p>  <p>  The SBCI have informed my Department that the relatively low progression from eligibility approval to loan sanction is largely a reflection of the current uncertainty regarding the outcome of Brexit. Businesses are establishing their eligibility but not yet drawing down the finance. The number of eligibility applications approved indicates a good level of interest in the Scheme, and is a good indicator of businesses engaging in Brexit preparedness.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Brexit Loan Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme has been developed by my Department and DBEI in partnership with the Department of Finance, the SBCI and the European Investment Fund (EIF).  It will be delivered through participating finance providers and make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agrifood &amp;amp; seafood sectors.  The loans will be competitively priced and will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p>  <p>  Food companies have identified long term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland. I am pleased that the Government have been able to deliver this product and its effects will be felt all along the food production chain from primary producer to processor.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to launch this Scheme recently with my colleagues. It is open for loan eligibility applications through the SBCI website since 17th April.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agrifood and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013), as well increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.</p>  <p>  However, it is also important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  In light of the on-going depressed market prices, I have, in discussions with Commissioner Hogan and my EU counterparts, said that I believe that the deployment of exceptional measures under the CMO Regulation, to provide targeted aid to farm families who have suffered a sustained reduction in returns from the market, is now required.  I made an intervention to this effect at the April meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and my officials have followed this up with a detailed submission, which is under consideration by Commission officials.</p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agrifood sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025. It is crucial that we all continue to work together. I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including the development of Beef Producer Organisations.</p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector.  I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to beef farmers under the RDP, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.</p></reply>

The highlight of 2018 in this respect was the decision of the Chinese authorities to open their market to Irish beef imports. Other notable achievements during 2018 were agreements with Qatar and Kuwait which allowed for the importation of Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry to their markets, and most recently in April 2019 we saw the opening of the Ukrainian market for Irish beef and pork.</p>  <p>  Trade Missions play an important role in securing market access, and in deepening trade with existing markets. March 2019 has already seen the first trade mission of the year, to Turkey, primarily focusing on Live Trade. The remainder of 2019 will see missions to China next week, Japan and South Korea in June, and Algeria and Egypt in November. These destinations are in keeping with Bord Bia's recent market prioritisation exercise, which has identified the markets that provide the greatest potential for an increase in Irish agrifood exports.</p>  <p>  Overall, agrifood exports to countries outside the EU have increased from around &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;3.6 billion in the period 2014 to 2018. This represents very rapid growth of 36% in that four-year timeframe. It remains the case, nonetheless, that exports to the UK comprise a very significant proportion of Irish agrifood exports.</p>  <p>  In that context, the avoidance of a hard Brexit must remain a critically important policy objective.</p></reply>

BnG is opposed to exports to countries that do not meet Ireland&rsquo;s welfare standards. BnG continues to advise owners to only export to destinations that provide the expected levels of greyhound welfare in its Code of Practice. I fully endorse this view.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Bord na gCon has no control of events outside the jurisdiction of Ireland and has no statutory function regarding the regulation of greyhound exports. The export of greyhounds could still continue indirectly via other countries before reaching their final destination. The World Trade Organisation does not presently envisage trade restrictions based on animal welfare concerns.</p>  <p>  BnG has informed me that potential solutions have been discussed through the International Greyhound Welfare Forum which includes national and international welfare agencies.

This may require any further legislative changes to be sponsored at a European level and as part of overall world trade agreements. </p>  <p>  Any person or persons found to have been in breach of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 have been and will continue to be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

However, Ireland supports increased domestic production of protein crops, which are of course GM-free. Since the introduction of the national coupled protein support payment in 2015, the area of protein crops, mainly beans, has increased from an average of 4,000 ha to 13,000 ha in 2017.</p>  <p>  Ireland imported approximately 5.1 million tonnes of animal feed materials in 2018. Ireland is very dependant therefore on internationally produced grains, particularly from North and South America's and where production systems are based on GM production. Over 90% of the soyabean and 80% of the maize products imported from Argentina, Brazil, Canada and the USA are derived from genetically modified crops. Approximately 2.7 million tonnes of these imports in 2018 were GM products, constituting over 50% of total feed imports.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine implements a comprehensive control plan to verify compliance with EU feed legislation and to ensure the safety of the animal feed chain, which includes inspections of feed businesses and sampling of animal feed for chemical and microbiological contaminants. The results of the annual control plan are available from the annual report on Ireland&rsquo;s National Control Plan.</p></reply>

The Irish Government&rsquo;s position will continue to be to minimise the impact of Brexit on existing trade for all Irish exports, including mushrooms.</p>  <p>  Support is currently provided by my Department and its State Agencies on a number of fronts.</p>  <p>  The EU Producer Organisation Scheme is a vital support for the mushroom sector, with around 80% of Irish mushroom growers being members of a producer organisation at present. This scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base. In addition this scheme is funding a number of initiatives to improve mushroom grower competitiveness including Lean Training for mushroom growers.  Indeed the concentration of supply through the Producer Organisation Scheme has allowed exporters in many cases to negotiate Sterling price rises from their UK customers in response to the weakening of Sterling.</p>  <p>  The Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector continues to be the main support for individual growers in the horticulture industry including mushroom producers who wish to make capital investments in specialised equipment or buildings. Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;1 million in funding bringing the total provision for a sector particularly challenged by Brexit to &euro;6 million.</p>  <p>  The new &ldquo;Future Growth Loan Scheme&rdquo; scheme which I launched recently will provide long term, unsecured investment finance for farmers and small scale companies in the food and seafood sectors. The loans will be competitively priced, will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. There will be &euro;50million to &euro;60million available initially for farmers.</p>  <p>  Bord Bia has commenced a 3-year mushroom promotion campaign on the Irish and UK markets. This campaign is co-funded by the industry and the European Commission. It is important to emphasise that the overall market for mushrooms in the UK and Ireland remains strong, showing good potential for further growth.</p></reply>

I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including the development of Beef Producer Organisations.</p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector.  I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to beef farmers under the RDP, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.</p></reply>

That article imposes a &euro;70,000 ceiling on the amount of State aid that may be granted to an individual farmer.  Accordingly, in the situation outlined by the Deputy, the full amount of the &euro;60,000 stamp duty chargeable on the open market purchase of farmland is relieved under the &lsquo;young trained farmer relief&rsquo;, which means in effect that &euro;60,000 State aid has been granted. </p>  <p>  I would again stress two points I made in my reply to your previous PQ on this matter.</p>  <p>  Firstly, supporting young farmers and generational renewal continues to be a priority for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as it is for the Government, and will form an important part of the CAP post-2020. Minister Creed and his Department are actively engaging with other Member States and the EU on these issues during the current negotiations on new CAP proposals. </p>  <p>  Secondly, any changes to the Regulation that gives rise to the lifetime cap on the state aid that farmers can receive under the three schemes covered by it in Ireland can only be considered in the context of the CAP negotiations. In the meantime, the Government must seek to ensure, as with all EU Regulations, that the Regulation is enforced here, or we risk being in contravention of EU law.</p></reply>

Primary legislation was necessary in order to bring that change into effect.  It was made clear at the time that until such legislation was enacted, the compulsory retirement age of 65, which applied to the vast majority of this cohort, remained in effect and pre-2004 public servants reaching that age would be required to retire.</p>  <p>  Interim arrangements were provided for the cohort of public servants who reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 after the Government Decision because, while they would be aware of the Government&rsquo;s decision, they would be unable to avail of it.  Those arrangements permitted these individuals to be rehired post-retirement for a period of 1 year until they reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory).  Without that specific arrangement, they would have been required to cease working on reaching the age of 65.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 was enacted on 26 December 2018. Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.  The terms of their contracts continue to apply and they will cease working when they reach the age of 66.</p>  <p>  Section 3 of the 2018 Act also provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the www.gov.ie website and in the Oireachtas Library online catalogue. </p>  <p>  Having considered all of the issues outlined in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision, pending enactment of the legislation.  The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.  Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the report, I do not propose to make any changes to those terms.</p></reply>

This scheduled further lessening of the PSPR impact on pensions means that from 1 January 2019 all pensions up to &euro;39,000 per annum will be exempt from PSPR, removing some 12,000 pensioners from the impact of PSPR.</p>  <p>  From 1 January 2020, further PSPR-amelioration will mean that all pensions up to &euro;54,000 per annum will be exempt from PSPR, removing some 10,500 additional pensioners from the impact of PSPR.</p>  <p>  When fully in place from the beginning of 2020, these changes will mean that the vast majority of public service retirees - approximately 97% - comprising everyone with occupational pension values up to at least &euro;54,000, will be entirely free of PSPR.

This policy is essentially a time-limited (expires end-2020) resumption of the non-statutory pension increase arrangements, sometimes known as pay parity, which formerly prevailed, but which lapsed in 2010. Under that policy, pay increases applied to serving staff over the course of the PSSA are passed on to those pensions where the salary on which the pension is based, in any case, does not exceed the salary of a serving staff member with the same grade and scale point, after the pay increase has been applied. If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.</p>  <p>  As regards pensions payable under the Single Pension Scheme, the pension scheme introduced for new entrants to the public service from 2013 onwards, the relevant legislation provides that pensions are uprated in line with CPI increases.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to provide increases in public service pensions of &euro;12,000 or less other than in accordance with the policies I have outlined.</p></reply>

Budgets 2017 and 2018 reflect adjustments including the allocation of additional funding for capital investment and budgetary decisions to prioritise additional spending supported by discretionary revenue measures.  </p><p><b>Table 1: Multi-Annual Gross Voted Current Expenditure Ceilings Budget 2014 - 2018 (&euro;m)</b></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Budget 2014</td><td>49,606</td><td>48,250</td><td>48,600</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2015</td><td>-</td><td>50,077</td><td>50,296</td><td>50,362</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2016</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>51,477</td><td>52,197</td><td>52,813</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2017</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>53,494</td><td>54,720</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2018</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>55,593</td></tr><tr><td>Outturn</td><td>50,501</td><td>50,864</td><td>51,775</td><td>54,019</td><td>57,052</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Multi-Annual Gross Voted Capital Expenditure Ceilings Budget 2014 - 2018 (&euro;m)</b></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Budget 2014</td><td>3,335</td><td>3,252</td><td>3,255</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2015</td><td>-</td><td>3,549</td><td>3,600</td><td>3,748</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2016</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>3,781</td><td>3,970</td><td>4,230</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2017</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>4,535</td><td>5,292</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2018</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>5,330</td></tr><tr><td>Outturn</td><td>3,597</td><td>3,730</td><td>4,212</td><td>4,601</td><td>5,928</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3: Multi-Annual Total Gross Voted Expenditure Ceilings Budget 2014 - 2018 (&euro;m)</b></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Budget 2014</td><td>52,941</td><td>51,502</td><td>51,855</td><td>- </td><td>- </td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2015</td><td>- </td><td>53,626</td><td>53,896</td><td>54,110</td><td>- </td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2016</td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>55,258</td><td>56,167</td><td>57,043</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2017</td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>58,029</td><td>60,012</td></tr><tr><td>Budget 2018</td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>0</td><td>60,923</td></tr><tr><td>Outturn</td><td>54,098</td><td>54,594</td><td>55,987</td><td>58,620</td><td>62,979</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies.</p>  <p>  The patronage process for primary and post-primary schools to be established in 2020 will commence in 2019, significantly ahead of their due opening. Updates in relation to further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website and my Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie).</p>  <p>  My Department has identified potential locations for the school and is currently working to undertake a detailed assessment of these.  It is not, unfortunately, possible to give an indicative timeline for the delivery of the new school at this point. Once the location has been determined, the project to deliver the school accommodation can advance into the architectural planning process.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF).</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  </p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school in the Naas school planning area, within which Kill is located, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  It is open to an individual school to apply for accommodation under the additional accommodation scheme if the school does not have sufficient capacity to meet school places.</p></reply>

At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post primary to the recruitment of teachers of particular subjects such as STEM, modern foreign languages, Irish and Home Economics.</p>  <p>  In response to these difficulties, the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established in March 2018.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group is considering the issues that relate to teacher supply under four policy headings: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession. It is supported in its work by the Teacher Supply Implementation Group and a number of working groups that are looking at specific policy areas. In undertaking its task, the Steering Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group is overseeing the Action Plan for Teacher Supply, which I published in November 2018. Several of the actions are aimed at supporting Irish teachers who are considering returning to Ireland to take up teaching positions, including:</p>  <p>  - The commencement of a new teacher sharing scheme for post-primary schools in the 2019/20 school year, as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 0015/2019.  This scheme will support young teachers in obtaining full time employment and enhance curricular choices in post primary schools.</p>  <p>  - The development of an online teacher recruitment portal is being explored.</p>  <p>  - The use of digital technology by schools to facilitate interviewing applicants, for teaching posts, is also being explored, particularly in the case of qualified applicants resident outside the State.</p>  <p>  - The Teaching Council is developing more streamlined processes for the registration of teachers, including those originally from Ireland, who qualified in jurisdictions outside the State.</p>  <p>  - In December 2018, a national campaign to promote the teaching profession was launched across a number of platforms, including radio and digital media, supported by a new dedicated webpage www.gov.ie/teachingtransforms. This website provides useful information about teaching as a career in Ireland.</p>  <p>  With regard to salary on return from teaching abroad, the position is that qualified teachers who work in schools outside the State may, on appointment to a teaching post in a recognised school in the Republic of Ireland, qualify for the award of incremental credit for the purposes of progression on the incremental salary scale under the terms of the schemes as outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circulars 10/01, 29/07 and 29/10.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that I intend to visit the United Arab Emirates in the coming months to meet with Irish teachers working there to ascertain how they can be best supported to return to Ireland to  work as teachers here. I have been working closely with the Irish Ambassador to the UAE and his staff to arrange to meet as many Irish teachers in the area as possible so as to hear their concerns.</p></reply>

My Department is satisfied that the needs in the area can be met through the replacement and expansion of the existing Curragh Post-Primary School with a new 1,000 pupil school building. It is intended that the expansion of the existing Curragh Post-Primary school, a multi-denominational Community College under the patronage of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB), will also cater for demand arising in the adjoining Newbridge and Kildare school planning areas. There is capacity in the existing Curragh Post-Primary school building pending delivery of the new school .  </p>  <p>   A new site will be required for the new school and my  Department has commenced the site identification process .  In line with protocols for the use of State property assets, my Department has written to the Department of Defence enquiring if the Department is in a position to provide a site that could be suitable.  Due to commercial sensitivities surrounding site acquisitions in general, I cannot comment further at this point in the process, though I can assure the Deputy that my Department is making every effort to progress the matter.</p>  <p>  Some initial engagement has taken place in relation to the potential for Educate Together to become a Trustee Partner for the school in a similar arrangement to those implemented elsewhere (e.g. Clonturk Community College with City of Dublin Education and Training Board (CDETB) as patron of the school and Educate Together as a Trustee Partner). The Department is satisfied that the needs of the area can be met through the expansion of this multi-denominational post-primary school.</p></reply>

The number of SNAs employed in a school depends on the allocation given to the school by the NCSE, based on its assessment of the special educational needs of pupils in the school. </p><p>My Department has no control over the allocation process to schools and is not in a position to influence the allocation process in light of the fact that the NCSE is an independent statutory body.  In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, the NCSE take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource and allocations to all schools can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.</p><p>In respect of job security, the supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) were established on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission when the Haddington Road Agreement was being agreed. These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020 , and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and F&Oacute;RSA, have signed up to that agreement. As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school / ETB.</p><p>  Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2018/2019 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0034/2018 which issued on 17 May 2017 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address:</p><p><i></i></p><p>  The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0034/2018 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectorial, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p><p>With regard to the contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs, this is outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (IMPACT and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005.  The agreement reached between the parties found expression in the two circular letters issued in 2005 detailing the contracts of employment for SNAs.</p><p><b>Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:</b>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary)</p><p><i></i></p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15/05 (Primary)</p><p><i> </i></p><p>The contracts were designed to be deliberately flexible to cater for the totally different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools, including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school, in order to help with the reception and dispersal of children, and the preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times should be agreed locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. I should point out that this divisor was also agreed with both the Management Authorities and the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.</p><p>Furthermore, the contract of employment for SNAs in the post primary sector specifically requires that SNAs in the post primary sector are required to work the month of June.</p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  Accordingly, DES Circular 71/2011 was issued on 15 December 2011 which outlined that these 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year. </p><p><b>Link to DES Circular 71/2011 is as follows:</b></p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).  </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the 2015 Act in 2020.  The Deputy will appreciate that a lead in timeframe is needed to ensure that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. There are many complex strands to this preparatory work, including the involvement of multiple organisations. </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018). </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.</p></reply>

West Division. The Garda strength of the D.M.R. West Division on 31 March 2019 the latest date for which figures are readily available was 720, of whom 201 are assigned to the Clondalkin District and 14 are assigned to Rathcoole Garda Station. There are also 24 Garda Reserves and 61 Garda civilian staff attached to the D.M.R. West Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 233 were assigned to the D.M.R. West Division.</p><p>The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions including the D.M.R. West Division.</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the .</p></reply>

The Irish Prison Service therefore has no control over the numbers committed to custody at any given time. </p>  <p>  The actual number of beds available on a given day can be less than the capacity figure as cells may be unavailable for different reasons such as repairs and maintenance.  Furthermore, where local management assess a prisoner as being unsuited to share a cell for reasons of vulnerability or propensity to violence, a cell designated as being operationally suitable for two prisoners may, temporarily, house only one prisoner. </p>  <p>  Where the number of prisoners exceeds the maximum capacity in any prison, my officials make every effort to deal with this through a combination of inter-prison transfers and structured Temporary Release. Decisions in relation to temporary release are considered on a case by case basis and the safety of the public is paramount when those decisions are made. </p>  <p>  My Department has been working closely with the Director General of the Irish Prison Service to ensure a safe working environment for staff and the safety and security of prisoners in our custody and we are taking a number of short and medium term steps to address the issue of increasing prison numbers.</p>  <p>  I am advised that plans are advanced for the re-opening of accommodation not currently being used within the system, including the re-opening of the Training Unit which itself will provide approximately an additional 90 spaces. </p>  <p>  In addition, an audit of existing accommodation is underway, in order to identify where additional spaces can be brought on stream with the potential to provide in excess of an additional 100 spaces.</p>  <p>  I have also recently signed a construction contract for the female prison in Limerick as well as a new wing to Limerick male prison.

While North America remains the principal source of FDI into the country, the IDA continues to diversify its portfolio of investors here. In 2018 alone, for example, 24 investments were secured from growth markets, representing an increase of 14% on 2017. </p><p>I am particularly encouraged by the progress made by IDA Ireland in attracting first-time investors from Asian markets. Last year, for example, saw notable investments from Chinese, Indian and South Korean firms. This shows that the concerted effort that the IDA has made to target Asian investors is now producing results in terms of new jobs here on the ground in Ireland.</p><p>While much has been accomplished in this context, the Government remains conscious of our need to continue attracting FDI from as many different countries as possible. To diversify investment here further, we need to build awareness of Ireland as a preferred investment destination in target countries, as well as improve competitiveness and consolidate Ireland&rsquo;s traditional strengths in terms of talent, productivity and ease of doing business. I am confident that this approach will help boost further the number of investors here from non-traditional markets and that we will continue to see greater geographic diversity across the IDA's client portfolio. The Agency's efforts in this context are already being reinforced and supported by the Global Ireland strategy, which will build and deepen Ireland's footprint all over the world in the period up to 2025.</p><p>While we will continue to focus on strengthening FDI from growth markets, we must also not neglect the importance of our traditional source markets. Ireland's strong track record with companies from those markets - which employ tens of thousands of people across the country - has been hard-won and is the product of decades of hard work. That is why the IDA will continue to do everything possible to sustain and grow investment levels from North America and Europe while also seeking to increase investment from growth markets. </p><p>The table below details the number of IDA-supported companies by country of origin.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Country of Origin      </div></th><th><div>   Number of companies      </div></th></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Bermuda</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Brazil</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>British Virgin Islands</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Cayman Islands</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Cyprus</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Czech Republic </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Hong Kong</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>India (including Sikkim)</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Israel</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Jersey</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Liechtenstein</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Luxembourg</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Malaysia </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mexico</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Monaco</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Nigeria</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Russia</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Slovenia</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>South Africa</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>South Korea</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Sri Lanka</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Taiwan (Province of China)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Turkey</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>United Arab Emirates (including Abu Dhabi)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom </td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>United States of America (including Puerto Rico)</td><td>766</td></tr><tr><td>Uruguay</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Vietnam </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>1,444</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, the employment permits system offers a conduit into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills and is operated as a vacancy led system.   </p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills Occupations List and the Ineligible Occupations List for the purposes of granting an employment permit.  The Lists are subject to twice-yearly review which is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process and involves consideration of the research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  Submissions to the review process are also considered by the Economic Migration Policy Interdepartmental Group chaired by DBEI and which includes the Department of Health.  </p>  <p>   Healthcare assistants are currently on the Ineligible Occupations List.  In order to have an occupation removed from the Ineligible List, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary evidence to substantiate their claims. Following completion of the most recent review, the role of Healthcare Assistant was not proposed for amendment at this time.    The views of the lead policy Government Department for the sector, in this case, the Department of Health, are an important part of the decision-making process.  Officials of that Department have advised the sector of the need for further evidence, demonstrating genuine efforts to recruit across the EEA. In particular the sector needs to engage with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social protection who have responsibility for EURES the (European Employment Services), and who are well positioned to help sectors to recruit from within the EEA.  </p>  <p>  The next review process to consider changes to the lists of occupations is scheduled to commence with a new public consultation phase over the next few weeks with any changes proposed based on the evidence considered, for implementation soon after.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Caranua&rsquo;s operations will be wound down during the course of 2019 and the organisation will be dissolved when it has completed the performance of its functions.</p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental committee comprising representatives from relevant departments and chaired by the Departments of Education and Skills is currently examining the way in which existing State services can best meet the needs of residential institutions survivors into the future. It should be noted that survivors have always been able to avail of existing mainstream services without self-identifying as survivors. It is anticipated that the inter-Departmental committee will report later this year.</p>  <p>  Regarding medical cards, eligibility for a medical card is established primarily on the basis of financial assessment. There are currently no proposals to extend automatic eligibility for medical cards to survivors who have accessed Caranua. However, in certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold, when he/she faces difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Furthermore, awards made by Caranua are disregarded in the income assessment for a medical card.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs are being considered in detail. It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly. </p>  <p>  I understand that the NTPF has now completed its report and is under final consideration by the Steering Group. It is expected that the Report will be submitted to the Department in approximately the next week. Any recommendations included in the report will then be considered.</p></reply>

The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation which is established under German legislation.  </p>  <p>  There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of ex-gratia monthly payments from my Department and all are now in their late 50s.  Both the German payments and the Irish ex-gratia payments made to the survivors are exempt from tax, including DIRT and are not reckonable as means for the purpose of Social Welfare payments. The rate of payment is related to the survivors' level of thalidomide related injury.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump sum and the  monthly payments for life, the supports provided to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, provision of appliances, artificial limbs,  equipment, housing adaptations, and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services. There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive to act as a liaison with regard to the ongoing health and personal social service needs of Irish survivors.</p></reply>

The HSE is required to conduct an assessment of an individual's financial circumstances to determine if an individual meets the eligibility requirements before a  medical card may be granted.  The medical card therefore will only come into effect from the date of approval by the HSE.  It should be noted that where particular medical costs arise in advance of any medical card being issued other supports are available to individuals to assist in the cost of medical care. If an individual has registered for the Drugs Payment Scheme he/she will only be required to pay for medication costs up to the value of &euro;124 per month.  In addition tax relief on medical expenses that an individual pays for oneself or on behalf of any other person may also be claimed. </p>  <p>  It is noted that the HSE can in very particular circumstances issue an emergency medical card for persons in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are issued  within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter  which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. With  the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on  an emergency basis, are followed up with a full application within a  number of weeks.</p></reply>

This equates to a cut of approximately 5% to the overall CAP budget, representing a cut of 3.9% to Pillar 1, Direct Payments and 15% to Pillar 2, Rural Development.  At least 5% of Rural Development funds are to be ring-fenced for LEADER.  </p>  <p>  I have been very firm in my view that I do not accept the proposed 5% cut to the CAP budget post-2020, and there is strong consensus on this issue amongst my Member State colleagues.  I have been strongly advocating for the CAP budget to be restored to current levels for the EU 27 for the next programming period, and I will continue to work towards achieving this objective until agreement on the MFF post 2020 proposals has been reached.  In addition, my colleague Minister Michael Ring, whose Department has overall responsibility for the LEADER programme, continues to strongly defend the LEADER budget as the MFF post-2020 negotiations progress.  The retention of an adequate budget for the CAP post-2020 is a key priority for Ireland.</p>  <p>  The negotiations on the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027 are ongoing, and are running in parallel with the negotiations on the CAP post-2020.  It is worth pointing out that agreement on the budgetary allocations under the next MFF is ultimately decided by Ministers for Finance and Heads of State and Government.  A decision on the MFF proposals is not expected to be reached until Autumn 2019 at the earliest.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the co-financing rates, the total allocation for the LEADER 2014&ndash;2020 Programme is &euro;250 million. The EU portion of this funding is provided under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) at the rate of 62.8% of total costs (&euro;157 million). The remaining 37.2% (&euro;93 million) in matching funding is provided by the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  Under the current EU Regulations, the maximum permitted contribution to LEADER expenditure from the EAFRD is 80%. The European Commission has proposed to leave this percentage unchanged under the proposals published for the 2021-2027 period.  </p>  <p>  Until the MFF proposals are agreed, it will not be clear what the precise financial implications for the CAP and the Rural Development Programme will be.  Based on the proposals, and this has been publically indicated by Commissioner Hogan, some &euro;47 million per annum in additional national funding would be required for Ireland to make up the proposed shortfall under Pillar II funding, and my Department would concur with that estimate.</p></reply>

Brexit has the potential to have a very significant impact on the sector, given its unique exposure to the UK market, which accounted for 38% (&euro;5.2 billion) of agrifood exports last year. </p>  <p>  There are on-going discussions with the Commission regarding the difficulties which would face Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and the assistance that might be required for its agriculture food and fishery sectors.  Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>  I have held a number of discussions with Commissioner Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the sector. I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agrifood and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013), as well increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.  </p>  <p>  However, it is also important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance. </p>  <p>  In light of the on-going depressed market prices, I have, in discussions with Commissioner Hogan and my EU counterparts, said that I believe that the deployment of exceptional measures under the CMO Regulation, to provide targeted aid to farm families who have suffered a sustained reduction in returns from the market, is now required.  I made an intervention to this effect at the April meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and my officials have followed this up with a detailed submission, which is under consideration by Commission officials.</p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agrifood sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025. It is crucial that we all continue to work together. I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including the development of Beef Producer Organisations.</p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector.  I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to beef farmers under the RDP, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.</p></reply>

Trade to other international third party markets reached &euro;117m, or 14% of total export value. The rest of the EU accounted for 19% of export totals.  </p>  <p>  The growth in the pig sector must also be viewed over the medium term coming at as it did from a base of &euro;330 million export value in 2010 the sector has shown exceptional growth &ndash; clear evidence of the accurate direction and focus of the Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 strategies.</p>  <p>  Chinese imports are expected to increase compared to 2019 potentially providing a boon for exporting slaughter plants. Indeed, pig prices have increased markedly since the beginning of this year as increasing import demand from China has materialised over the last couple of months. However, longer term much will depend on the continuing African Swine Fever (ASF) situation both within China, and across the EU, trade relations between China and the US and competition from peer-exporting nations.</p>  <p>  Expanding access into new markets such as Mexico and further penetration of lucrative markets like  Japan and South Korea will be the primary goals for Irish exporters this year. The recent announcement of new Agriculture Attach&eacute; posts in Mexico City, Tokyo and Seoul underlines my Department's commitment to pursuing and further developing opportunities for Irish pigmeat exporters in international markets.</p>  <p>  These and other factors such as farm viability, global market share and a stable animal health situation will determine sectorial prosperity in the years to come.  The Department will continue to work closely with the sector and, by focusing on insight-led growth strategies, to take advantage of opportunities for Irish pig meat exporters on international markets.</p></reply>

It is of particular relevance given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our exposure to traditional destinations such as the UK. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to open new markets and deepen trade with existing markets for Irish food. The highlight of 2018 in this respect was the decision of the Chinese authorities to open their market to Irish beef imports. Other notable achievements during 2018 were agreements with Qatar and Kuwait which allowed for the importation of Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry to their markets, and, most recently, in April 2019 we saw the opening of the Ukrainian market for Irish beef and pork.</p>  <p>  Trade Missions play an important role in opening up new opportunities for Irish food production. I have led a number of such missions over the last two years in particular, and the first one of 2019 took place in March, when I led a mission to Turkey which was primarily focused on live trade. The remainder of 2019 will see missions to China next week, Japan and South Korea in June, and Algeria and Egypt in November. These destinations are in keeping with Bord Bia's recent market prioritisation exercise, which has identified the markets that provide the greatest potential for an increase in Irish agrifood exports.</p>  <p>  Overall, agrifood exports to countries outside the EU have increased from around &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;3.6 billion in the period 2014 to 2018. This represents very rapid growth of 36% in that four-year timeframe. It remains the case, nonetheless, that exports to the UK comprise a very significant proportion of Irish agrifood exports.</p></reply>

It underlines the agrifood sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to develop.   </p>  <p>  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness, as well as specific sectorial recommendations.  </p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee that drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believed that significant value growth projections are achievable by 2025, including increasing the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion. </p>  <p>  In July 2018, I launched the third annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2018. This showed that by 2017 exports had increased by 15.9% compared to the baseline.</p>  <p>  As of Q4 2018, of the 375 detailed actions in Food Wise which were due to commence by 2018 or are on-going actions; 79% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken and a further 21% have commenced and are progressing well. This represents a 6% increase in target achieved over Q3 2018. </p>  <p>  Market Development was identified as one of the key five cross-cutting themes in Food Wise 2025. It highlights the need to ensure that Irish products are targeted at the right markets and the right segments within these markets. The global evolving market environment presents enormous potential opportunities for the agrifood sector. </p>  <p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s Action Plan on intensifying international market access, a new online international market access tool was developed. This portal provides information across some of the major export sectors of dairy, meat, seafood and live animals.  </p>  <p>  I have also led a series of agrifood trade missions to key existing and emerging markets; my Department's agricultural attach&eacute; network in key Embassies has been increased and I have provided significant additional resources to Bord Bia's marketing and promotion efforts.</p>  <p>  Preparations for a new agrifood strategy to 2030 are underway. Its development will involve an analysis of a range of cross-cutting themes and the various sub-sectors of the agrifood industry, a formal public consultation and the establishment of a committee to develop the strategy.</p>  <p>  Without pre-empting the work of the new committee and the eventual content of the 2030 strategy, it is clear that the cross-cutting themes contained in Food Wise (environmental sustainability, market development, competitiveness, innovation, and human capital) will continue to be highly relevant. It is likely that environmental sustainability, and in particular, the contribution that agriculture can make to climate action, will need significant consideration and prominence.</p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is currently developing a climate roadmap for the agrifood sector to ensure that the future development of the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, will be built upon and contribute fairly to Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets. This will form a key element of the 2030 strategy. In parallel, my Department is also working on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan, which in line with the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals, will recognise that greater environmental and climate ambition is required. These important strategic and policy developments at national and European levels, as well as others in areas such as international trade and the bioeconomy, will inform the 2030 strategy.</p></reply>

Our policy approach is based on three principles:</p><p>- Reducing agricultural emissions</p><p>- Increasing carbon sequestration; and</p><p>- Displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials. </p><p>My Department and its agencies are actively engaged with the farming sector on a large range of measures and actions focused on the environment and climate, which support the continued transition towards a low carbon economy and society. </p><p>Measures include:</p><p>- The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) aimed at lowering the intensity of GHG emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd and the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP);</p><p>- The Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme; </p><p>- The Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS); and </p><p>- Initiatives such as Origin Green, Quality Assurance schemes and Knowledge Transfer Schemes; </p><p>all of which contribute to lowering the carbon footprint of the sector.</p><p>In terms of sequestration our most significant intervention is the national afforestation programme. My Department invests heavily in the Afforestation Scheme to encourage landowners to establish forests on their land. The Government has recently approved significant improvements in grant and premium rates under the agroforestry and forestry for fibre options. </p><p>The third strand to our climate policy approach focuses on energy efficiency, energy provision from biomass and other agricultural products and on the use of wood products to substitute for materials associated with high levels of emissions such as steel, concrete and fossil fuels. I have recently made available &euro;10 million under TAMS for energy measures.</p><p>My Department continues to review options that will enable our farmers to transition to a low carbon economy. While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.</p></reply>

Key features of this policy include setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible, and in all cases by 2020 as well as a discards ban (Landing Obligation) that was phased in over the period 2015 to 2019. </p>  <p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is an essential aspect of the policy. Fishing opportunities are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. The Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  To achieve this, the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks by 2020 at the latest. This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.</p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2018, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. From the 74 stocks, 32 are assessed as being sustainably fished in 2018. This number has grown every year since 2013. This in turn leads to the number of stocks being over fished declining from 22 in 2014 to 16 in 2018.</p>  <p>  The 2018 December Fisheries Council, at which quotas for 2019 were agreed, showed a rebuilding of many stocks. I was pleased that the scientific advice supported large increases in a number of stocks of importance such as Haddock (+20%), Hake (+28%) and Megrims (+47%) in the Celtic Sea. The overall increase of 30% in whitefish quota will provide improved fishing opportunities for whitefish fishermen all around our coasts. This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservation measures are paying off.</p>  <p>  Provided we can successfully navigate the potential difficulties arising from Brexit, in cooperation with our EU27 partners, I am confident that we will be able to ensure the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors, thereby supporting the families and communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.</p></reply>

In 1996, there were approximately 500 deer farms with 20,000 deer in Ireland, but numbers have declined sharply since that time. </p>  <p>  Today, there are only a small number of farmers in Ireland actively supplying deer for meat production, which cater primarily to specialised niche markets. The sector is reliant upon producers and companies ensuring that a market exists for their product, an objective which Bord Bia assists in by identifying and developing potential market outlets.</p>  <p>  There was some recent growth in game (venison) market during 2016, for example, with around 764 deer slaughtered for this market, but this declined to 271 deer for 2017, with 133 deer slaughtered so far in 2018.</p>  <p>  Growth in the past was achieved as a result of improved distribution for game meats, especially in supermarkets. Game and exotic meats historically occupy a premium, niche segment of the meat market. Whilst there are opportunities to compete with the larger premium segment of the red meat/poultry categories, it is important to note that demand is seasonal, with the greatest concentration of retail shelf space dedicated to game in the Winter/Christmas period. </p>  <p>  My Department has approved one factory for the slaughter of deer in Ireland, and two game-handling plants. There may also be outlets for processing of venison in Local Authority approved plants, but this would be a matter for the Local Authority concerned.</p>  <p>  There is no reliance on wild deer in the sector currently.    </p>  <p>  In terms of lamb trade,  while sheepmeat export volumes were down by 4% in 2018 compared to 2017, exports by values were up 2% to &euro;315m.  Factory gate prices were also higher than in 2017. The medium term prospects for the lamb sector both at national, EU and global level suggest that market prospected are generally good.  </p>  <p>  Meat consumption overall is expected to increase globally by 15% in the next decade due to population increases. My Department is currently seeking to increase market access for sheepmeat including applications for access to the Chinese and Japanese markets.</p></reply>

I also announced an additional &euro;20 million in funding in Budget 2019, through the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP).</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  According to National Farm Survey, already suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  </p>  <p>  However, it is also important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions.

Of course, my Department remains extremely vigilant in monitoring the current market and emerging trends, particularly as we approach the peak period for Irish milk production.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland exported dairy products to approximately 140 countries totalling over &euro;4.5 billion worth of produce, an increase of over 5% by volume compared to 2017 and another year of strong performance by the Irish dairy sector.  I expect this increase in exports of Irish dairy products to continue into the future with increasing emphasis on third country markets.</p>  <p>  Irish dairy products have a highly rated and hard earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets over the world. My Department, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, are playing a key role in building the market for Irish dairy with intensive Ministerial trade mission programmes and other promotional work.  Against the backdrop of our efforts to significantly increase dairy output and grow the sector, export market diversification is of the utmost importance, and this is particularly true in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong, with growing global demand projected from emerging economies with increasing middle classes. Whilst significant challenges have continued throughout recent years, in particular price volatility, there is confidence that the Irish and EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged and will continue to engage with stakeholders on these and other important issues.</p></reply>

Other EU markets now account for almost 10% of Irish exports, with France leading the way followed closely by Finland and the Netherlands. Exports to third country markets now amount to around 10% of export totals, with South Africa showing the biggest growth for Irish exporters: this market grew by 14% in 2018 to just under &euro;30 million. </p>  <p>  Irish production again hit record levels in 2018, with 98.6 million birds slaughtered in export-approved plants, an increase of 3.3% compared to 2017, with most of the increase evident in broiler and duck production. Overall, Irish poultry production is expected to exceed the 100 million mark in 2019.</p>  <p>  While the outlook for 2019 remains broadly positive, the sector continues to face challenges particularly the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. In this context, the pursuit and development of new markets is an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agrifood sector, as evidenced by the market development theme of Food Wise 2025. My Department is currently actively pursuing market access for poultry in a number of third country markets, including South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia. </p>  <p>  As in other meat sectors, global trade conditions will be crucial in determining the outlook for the Irish poultry sector over the medium to longer term.</p></reply>

BIM reported total seafood sector employment of 14,359 for 2018.  While the value of our seafood exports declined 4% in 2018, the overall trend over the past decade has been one of strong growth.   </p>  <p>  There are a number of opportunities and threats to our seafood sector in the coming years.  The potential impacts of Brexit remain a concern and my Department and its agencies, and indeed other State bodies such as Enterprise Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, have been working closely with stakeholders in planning for all scenarios.  There are also very many reasons to be positive about the future of the sector.  Demand on international markets is such that there are valuable business opportunities for quality Irish seafood.  My Department and its agencies are pursuing a number of strategies to assist our seafood enterprises in realising those opportunities, including Food Wise 2025, the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development and the recently published Strategy for the Inshore Fisheries Sector.  </p>  <p>  These strategies are being supported through my Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Operational Programme, which is the vehicle for financial supports to our seafood sector for the period 2014 to 2020.  The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 18 schemes.  The Programme is co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Union.  Some &euro;41 million in financial supports were invested in the sector in 2018, leveraging significant private investment by seafood processors in value-adding and investments in increased productivity by aquaculture enterprises.  The catching sector also continues to invest strongly in equipment on-board to add value to catch, improve quality, enhance safety and hygiene and embrace energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing our seafood sector continue to grow and provide essential employment growth in peripheral coastal communities in the year ahead.</p></reply>

I am advised by IFI that restocking is a complex matter that is carefully considered in the context of the protection of existing wild stocks.   In relation to potential restocking of salmon, there are significant genetic and ecological concerns when the progeny of wild salmon reared in a hatchery environment are released back into the wild as each of Ireland&rsquo;s more than 140 salmon rivers has its own genetically unique stock of salmon. For this reason each salmon stock is managed individually based on the conservation limit established for each river. Ireland&rsquo;s salmon management measures are considered best in class internationally </p>  <p>  Re-stocking with hatchery reared fish can be detrimental to the genetic integrity of individual stocks and negatively impact their long term sustainability. IFI follows the guidelines of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with regard to applying the precautionary approach to any proposed re-stocking of hatchery reared Atlantic salmon into the wild.</p>  <p>  Internationally re-stocking in not considered an appropriate solution in management measures for wild Atlantic salmon. IFI&rsquo;s advice for enhancement of salmon populations nationally is to continue with single stock salmon management to achieve individual river spawning targets while also supporting habitat enhancement and removal of artificial barriers to migration rather than artificial re-stock enhancements which have potentially detrimental genetic impacts. </p>  <p>  National policy is that management measurements for wild brown trout should be generally directed towards conservation, with return of captured fish, and towards habitat-management/enhancement measures designed to increase carrying capacity and restore depleted wild brown trout stocks.</p>  <p>  IFI have confirmed that a series of genetic studies on Irish brown trout populations has revealed that there is enormous genetic diversity within and among brown trout populations. Research has shown that stocking with hatchery reared brown trout makes no significant contribution to those fisheries where they have been introduced. In addition, it has been shown that restocking of non-native salmonids can be detrimental to the freshwater pearl mussel, a protected species included in Annex II and V of the EU Habitats Directive.</p>  <p>  &ldquo;IFI has supplied hatchery reared fish to angling clubs around the country. The main species stocked are brown trout and, in respect of put and take fisheries, rainbow trout. Re-stocking requests are considered in the context of EU legislation, biodiversity considerations and best scientific advice.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have attached a copy of IFI&rsquo;s fish stocking guidance document.</p></reply>

The regulation of these service providers, to the extent permitted by law, is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg in accordance with the Communications Regulation Act 2002. This role includes the monitoring of compliance by authorised operators with terms and conditions, including with respect to non-ionising radiation levels. ComReg is statutorily independent in the exercise of its functions.</p><p>As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have policy responsibility for matters pertaining to public exposure to non-iodising radiation. Irish policy in this area is informed by a substantial volume of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence. This includes the guidelines set down by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). </p><p>These guidelines provide scientifically based exposure limits that are applicable to both public and occupational exposure from electromagnetic fields (EMF), including 5G. ICNIRP guidelines apply up to a frequency of 300 gigahertz (GHz), well above the maximum frequencies being considered for 5G. ICNIRP guidelines are based on evidence gathered from all peer reviewed scientific literature and not on the conclusions of any single scientific paper, event, or other source. </p><p>In 2015, the Irish Government commissioned a report by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands (RIVM). This was published in 2016 and is entitled <i>&ldquo;Electromagnetic Fields in the Irish Context&rdquo;</i>. It examined and synthesised existing peer-reviewed research into clear findings, with particular focus on the potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields arising from high voltage power lines, and electromagnetic fields from base stations for mobile communication. This report reaffirms the overall conclusion of an earlier 2007 report, <i>&ldquo;Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields&rdquo;</i>, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects. </p><p>In this regard, I have recently assigned a new statutory function to the Environmental Protection Agency to provide general information to the public on matters pertaining to public exposure to non-ionising radiation, to monitor international scientific developments and provide independent advice to my Department in this area.</p></reply>

I recently announced how the additional &euro;1.5m for 2019 is to be used to support the sustainability of existing Family Resource Centres (FRCs) and to enable a number of FRCs to engage additional family support workers.</p>  <p>  A number of FRCs also receive funding from other sources within my Department.</p>  <p>  Many Family Resource Centres provide Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Aged Childcare (SAC) to children. My Department, through a Funding Agreement, provides a range of supports through capitation payments and other programmes. The complete list of FRCs which received this funding in 2018 is currently being compiled by my officials, and a full list will be provided to the Deputy directly. Funding in 2019 will be based on the level of ELC/SAC provision in each centre.</p>  <p>  The Trim Family Resource Centre in County Meath received funding of &euro;34,692.90 under the 2018 Quality and Capacity Building Initiative (QCBI) Innovation Fund, which is administered by Tusla, on behalf of my Department. This funding supported a project, which enabled young people to re-engage with education and/or training and employment, to develop life skills that foster good relations, build confidence and resilience. Funding has not been provided for this project under the QCBI in 2019.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the Youth Affairs Unit in my Department provided funding of &euro;89,203 to the Northside Family Resource Centre in Ballynanty, Limerick, for the "Follow Your Dream" youth project. The same level of funding will be provided to the Northside FRC for this project in 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department also provided funding under the Capacity Building Grant for the National LGBTI+ Strategy to three Family Resource Centres in 2018. Ballymun Child and Family Resource Centre in Dublin received &euro;1,400, Greystones Family Resource Centre in Co. Wicklow received &euro;2,500, and Northside Family Resource Centre in Ballynanty, Limerick, received &euro;3,770.40 under this funding stream. Funding amounts for 2019 have not yet been determined.</p>  <p>  I should inform that Deputy that the funding from my Department represents only a portion of the total funding available to FRCs nationally. FRCs draw on various sources of funding provided by other Government Departments and Agencies. I am informed by Tusla that, in 2018, FRCs received in excess of &euro;40m when all funding sources were considered.  </p>  <p>  I recognise and value the very positive impact of the work of the Family Resource Centres in supporting families and local communities.  The Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their community. This universal accessibility allows for early identification of need, provision of appropriate interventions, and timely referrals to appropriate services for more intensive and targeted work as required.</p></reply>

These supports are designed to ensure that services are supported to remain open wherever possible. Pobal has a dedicated team which works with services facing difficulties. This team offers support with activities such as business planning and accounting to assist services manage any challenges they may face. The team can, in certain circumstances , also offer direct financial support. </p>  <p>  I strongly recommend any service which finds itself in difficulty to get in contact with their local CCC and Pobal immediately, and I would encourage them to fully explore the support options available to them before making any final decision.

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  The HomeCaring Periods can be claimed for any year in which they occurred - they are not limited to years since 1994.</p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided under the 2000-2012 ratebands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 52) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of those changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.  There would also be a very significant cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred millions of euros each year.  This in turn could significantly impact funds for future pension increases with consequential implications for pensioner poverty.  </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for the full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;237 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.

Under the Regulations each authority must establish a credit committee to decide on applications for loans. The Regulations broadly set out the amount that can be lent under the scheme, the eligibility criteria for loans, the duties of borrowers and housing authorities and other administrative matters relating to the scheme. Under the Regulations a credit policy is issued which sets out in greater detail the requirements regarding eligibility under the scheme.  Under both the Regulations and the credit policy it is clearly stipulated that a loan cannot be issued where the house being purchased has a gross internal floor area of 175 square metres or more.  It is therefore not possible for a local authority to approve a loan for a property with a gross internal floor area of more than 175 square metres.</p></reply>

The scheme has proved to be more successful than was originally envisaged and as a result I have been in discussions with my colleague the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform regarding further funding for it. In order to protect both borrowers and local authorities the continuation of the scheme will have to be in accordance with the prudent lending criteria under which the scheme currently operates. I therefore have no plans to change the eligibility criteria governing the scheme.</p></reply>

The principal need is to ensure good habitat for the species and work has been carried out particularly by game club members and grouse enthusiasts on many bog areas, such as Boleybrack Mountain, Glenfarne and Ballydangan.  Sustainable grazing regimes in commonage lands is being supported through Commonage Management Plans in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s GLAS scheme, which in turn should favour red grouse.</p>  <p>  The pheasant is an introduced species and is managed mainly by gun clubs around the country.</p>  <p>  The grey partridge was on the verge of extinction but a project continues on lands owned by my Department at Boora in County Offaly to provide good habitat, and associated predator control, in order to protect and enhance the population. This project in turn has supplied birds to projects in Fingal and Co Donegal. The GLAS scheme includes a measure for grey partridge in targeted lands in Boora, Fingal and Co. Donegal. The partridge remains at low population levels however.</p>  <p>  Woodcock is a breeding species but numbers are greatly increased by winter migrants. The sale of woodcock was banned some years ago by my Department on foot of recommendations by the hunting associations to assist in their conservation.</p></reply>
