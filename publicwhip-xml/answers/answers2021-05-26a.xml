Our discussions focused on ways our two Governments can continue to work together to support all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and promote peace and prosperity on both a North/South and East/West basis. We also discussed issues around implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.</p><p>We discussed the long journey of the Ballymurphy families for justice to vindicate the innocence of their loved ones. In this context I emphasised the importance of the British Government responding to the families in a way that recognises the gravity of the findings which categorically established that ten innocent people were killed. </p><p>As well as discussing Ballymurphy specifically, Prime Minister Johnson and I spoke about legacy issues, and of how best to secure progress and answers for the many families who have been pursuing truth and justice now for far too many years. </p><p>I was clear with the Prime Minister that every family bereaved in the conflict should have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.  The Stormont House Agreement framework allows for the crucial elements we need &ndash; investigations, truth recovery, oral history, reconciliation and acknowledgement.</p><p>While the Government is ready to engage and work with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties in relation to any concerns around the aspects of the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, I made clear that this must be a collaborative and collective process.</p><p>I also made clear that unilateral action cannot be the basis of any sustainable way forward.  </p><p>We will continue to engage with the UK Government on this. </p><p>We also discussed British-Irish relations, and we are both ambitious for the development of the next phase of the bilateral relationship framed around a number of areas of common interest, including research and innovation, sport, cultural interests and tackling climate change. </p><p>We had a good exchange on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the value of working together. </p><p>The Prime Minister and I agreed to remain in close touch over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

In limited circumstances this may be extended by an additional six months. Further extension beyond this is only allowed with the consent of the claimant. </p>  <p>  In common with many services there has been some impact on PIAB&rsquo;s services arising from the pandemic. Most notably, independent medical examinations were suspended for periods due to restrictions and the need to protect the health system since March 2020. Notwithstanding the pandemic, PIAB processed over 26,000 claims in 2020 with the average time taken to assess a claim, from the date of consent to the date of award, being nine months.</p></reply>

The purpose of the group is to review the collective bargaining and the industrial relations landscape in Ireland.</p>  <p>  To date, the Group have held two meetings.  The Group is due to submit an interim report by the end of July 2021 with the aim of completing its work as soon as possible thereafter.</p>  <p>  Ireland's system of Industrial Relations is based in voluntarism. While the right of workers to form associations and join a trade union is enshrined in Article 40 of the Irish Constitution, under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognise any union for the purposes of collective bargaining.  I have no direct role in these matters.  </p>  <p>  It would be best to follow up the specific matter raised by the Deputy with my colleague Minister Catherine Martin.</p></reply>

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 20 May 2021, over 218,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Donegal in Milford, Letterkenny, Ramelton, Termon, Ballymacool, Kilmacrennan, Mullaghfin and Tommyscroft. Further details are available on specific areas within County Donegal through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 20 May, 317 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Sliabh Liag Ranger Station, Leghowney Community Centre (located 13.7 kilometres from the premises), Rathlin Knitwear,The Gweedore Theatre, Dunree Military Museum, Tory Co-Op, Ray Community Centre, Meenreagh Hostel and Cranford Coole Community Centre. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>Drumfad National School, Urbalreagh National School, Scoil Naomh Cholmcille, Scoil Naoimh Colum and Doaghbeg National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Some 42 primary schools are to be connected in Donegal.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/. </p></reply>

I am informed that the maintenance agreement was reviewed in 2019 and revised arrangements agreed last year between the NTA and I&Eacute; which reflect the fact that no rail services have operated on the line for just over a decade. Among these revised arrangements is the decision to leave the Barrow Bridge in the &lsquo;open&rsquo; position for marine traffic, reflective of the fact that while no rail services have operated on the line for over a decade, the Barrow itself remains open for marine traffic serving New Ross port. </p><p>I am informed that a specific mechanism has been designed which will allow the bridge to be safely held open and that the design of this mechanism is such that this can be easily reversed if rail services resume in the future.  So while the bridge is being maintained open, this position can easily be reversed if the line is required to go back into service. </p><p>Separately, the Deputy is also aware that I am undertaking a <i>Strategic Rail Review</i>to examine the rail network on the island of Ireland in relation to improving sustainable connectivity between the major cities, enhancing regional accessibility, supporting balanced regional development and rail connectivity to our international gateways, with the latter also considering the role of rail freight.  The <i>Review</i>will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services along the various existing, or future potential, corridors of the network and that scope will certainly include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines such as the one referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  </p>  <p>  The extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post 2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason, the primary focus for capital investment at present is the maintenance and renewal of the network and implementation of the 12 regional and local road projects identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP.  </p>  <p>  Any road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration for funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code (PSC) and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF).</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that Kildare County Council have been focussed on seeking funding for the proposed second bridge in Newbridge under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) administered by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG). To date no application has been received by my Department from Kildare County Council in relation to the proposed second bridge in Newbridge.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the scope for considering any new significant road improvement projects is dependent on the outcome of the NDP review.</p></reply>

Information regarding the number of applicants and backlogs are held by the Authority. This part of the question is being referred to it for direct reply. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.   </p>  <p>  The Driver Theory Test is considered a non-essential service and remains closed for now. The Department understands the frustration at this decision. However, these restrictions imposed by the Government based on the advice of NPHET and their panel of scientific experts, are in place to minimize the impact of Covid-19 on this country and its people. </p>  <p>  Officials both in this Department and in the Road Safety Authority are keeping the public health situation under constant review and are working extremely hard to ensure that Theory Tests can resume as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  From the start, it has been clear that the first priority is public safety. We want to provide services, and we know people are looking for services but we will provide them only to the limit possible while preserving public health.</p>  <p>  Because the service was closed for long periods of time over the last year, a large backlog of customers has built up. To deal with the backlog, the RSA have plans to increase capacity when it is allowed to re-open. This additional capacity will see the number of tests increase from an average pre Covid19 output of approximately 15,000 tests per month up to 50,000 per month,  subject to health assurances. This will help significantly to tackle the backlog.</p>  <p>  The RSA has been working to deliver an online service, with a pilot online test already underway for trucks and buses. This pilot service has now been extended to include a limited number of car and motorbike tests.  </p>  <p>  The new offering online will see 4,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles per month. Tests are available on a &lsquo;first come, first served&rsquo; basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year. Once the online service is established, all customers will be able to opt to do the test online.</p></reply>

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.  </p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, position of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.   </p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3.1 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;520 million have been granted to 49,000 employers in respect of 560,000 workers.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the support which EWSS provides to businesses and, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of June 2021. Similarly, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme has also been extended to end June 2021. </p>  <p>  Motions seeking D&aacute;il approval of the extension of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 30 June 2021 took place on Thursday 22 April, during which I reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment that there would be no cliff-edge end to the economic supports at the end of June. </p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. </p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

Under the DRS, qualifying road transport operators may qualify for a repayment of part of the mineral oil tax paid on auto-diesel purchased in the State for use in the course of their business.  Applications by qualifying operators for repayments are made in respect of a quarterly repayment period. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the DRS quarterly rebate rate is calculated using an estimate of the quarterly national average purchase price of diesel.  This estimate is based on data provided by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  CSO figures for the first two months of each quarter are used to arrive at the quarterly national average purchase price of diesel.  The calculation of DRS quarterly rebate rates is carried out in accordance with formulae set out in legislation &ndash;</p><p>(a) Where the estimate of the quarterly average purchase price of diesel (excluding VAT) is less than or equal to &euro;1,070 per 1,000 litres the rebate rate is calculated as follows: </p><p>Amount to be repaid per 1,000 litres = (Quarterly Average Price per 1,000 litres &ndash; 1,000) x 0.3</p><p>(b) Where the estimate of the quarterly average purchase price of diesel excluding VAT is greater than &euro;1,070 per 1,000 litres the rebate rate is calculated as follows:</p><p>Amount to be repaid per 1,000 litres = 21 + [(Quarterly Average Price per 1,000 litres &ndash; 1,070) x 0.6]  </p><p>The rebate amount is capped at 7.5 cent per litre, which arises when the average price of diesel (excluding VAT) is &euro;1.16 or more per litre.</p><p>The Deputy is asking about the rebate rates for Quarter 4 2020 and Quarter 1 2021.  The CSO figures for the monthly national average price of diesel (including VAT) for October 2020 to March 2021 are listed below.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Month</th>       <th>National Average   Price &euro;/litre</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>October 2020</td>       <td>1.244 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November 2020</td>       <td>1.253 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December 2020</td>       <td>1.181</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January 2021</td>       <td>1.214</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>February 2021</td>       <td>1.251</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March 2021</td>       <td>1.332</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The average price used by Revenue for Q4 2020 is based on the CSO figures for October and November.  The average price used by Revenue for Q1 2021 is based on the CSO figures for January and February.  Therefore, it is correct that the rebate rate for the first quarter of this year is lower than that for the last quarter for 2020.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that, when calculating DRS rebate rates for the last quarter of 2020 the temporary reduction in the VAT rate (from 23% to 21%) was not taken into account.  The corrected rebate rate of &euro;0.01 per litre for Q4 2020 will now be applied to all valid claims from qualifying operators for that period.  Also, claims for Q1 2021 are currently being processed, and the correct DRS rate for Q1 2021 of &euro;0.006 will be applied for rebates on all valid claims for that period.</p></reply>

The Strategy and supporting action plan have cross-departmental ownership and, accordingly, responsibility for implementation falls on a number of Government Departments, bodies and Irish language and Gaeltacht organisations. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is responsible <i>inter alia</i>, for coordinating its implementation.</p><p>The Action Plan and the  inaugural annual progress report published in October 2020, represent a clear overview of the 180 or so actions being advanced by c. 60 stakeholders in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions.  </p><p>Undoubtedly, functioning in the shadow of the pandemic over the last year has proved challenging  and this is no less the case in terms of delivery of supports in the domains of Irish language and Gaeltacht affairs.  </p><p>Nonetheless, significant progress is being made and the forthcoming publication of the second progress report - covering the period from July 2019 to December 2020 - following Government approval, will set out in detail the advances that have been made on a cross-governmental and cross-sectoral basis over the period. </p><p>In terms of financial supports for the language insofar as my Department is concerned, I might also point out that an additional  exchequer allocation of &euro;14.8m was included in Budget 2021, further enabling support for the language and Gaeltacht regions  - particularly in the context of the ongoing implementation of the language planning process and the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, being spearheaded by the Department of Education.  </p><p>This additional allocation ultimately means that total funding in excess of &euro;78m is being deployed by my Department in support of the Irish language and Gaeltacht regions in the current year. </p><p>An overview of measures, schemes and initiatives being undertaken in support of the language can be found on my Department's website as well as those of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the scheme, the Department provides a subsidy, currently worth &euro;10 per day (equivalent to &euro;220 per student for a three week course) which benefits over 26,000 students a year while staying in any of the c.700 Gaeltacht households approved under the scheme. </p><p>This represents a State investment of over &euro;4m annually in support of the Irish summer colleges sector. Not only does this annual state investment yield benefits in providing language learning and enrichment opportunities to thousands of young people annually, it also generates economic benefits for Gaeltacht regions.</p><p>In addition to providing and administering this practical assistance, the Department also administers a number of further specific measures under the scheme, including: <b>DEIS Gaeltachta</b>.  Under this measure which was introduced in 2019, 50 scholarships are made available annually -  worth c. &euro;850 each - to qualifying students attending DEIS post-primary schools. The scheme is administered on behalf of the Department by Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board.</p><p>Due to COVID-19, it was not possible to provide the scholarships last year nor indeed this year, following the recent decision not to proceed with recognised Irish summer courses, in the interests of protecting public health.</p><p>It is envisaged that the provision of scholarships under <b>DEIS Gaeltachta </b>will resume next year or as soon as it is safe to do so. The number of scholarships made available under the measure will of course be kept under consideration in the context of available resources and competing demands.  However, it is a stated priority of mine to expand this scheme in order to increase the availability of the Gaeltacht experience to students from all socio-economic backgrounds.</p><p>In the interest of completeness, the Deputy may be interested to note that both I and my officials are continuing to engage with the summer colleges sector on foot of the decision to cancel courses this summer. The overall purpose of this engagement  - which includes discussions with a representative group of Gaeltacht accommodation providers, is to tailor insofar as possible, suitable stabilisation measures with a view to ensuring the sector is on a sound footing for a full and safe return in 2022.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Group is to oversee the implementation of the Recovery Plan produced by the Tourism Recovery Taskforce and monitor the sector&rsquo;s recovery from the COVID crisis.</p><p>The Recovery Oversight Group is made up of an independent chairperson and 8 other members with a broad spectrum of backgrounds who were selected on the basis of each person's capacity to bring his/her personal knowledge, skills, experience, competence, capability, strategic leadership and ideas to the work of the group. I appointed individuals who, together, will work for the good of Irish tourism as a whole. No member of the Group was appointed to represent any particular sector. A recovery in the tourism sector will be beneficial for all businesses which depend on the sector, including pubs and restaurants.</p><p>In October 2020, I, together with the T&aacute;naiste, Minister Varadkar, established a Hospitality and Tourism Forum to provide a platform for structured engagement between the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the tourism agencies and relevant Government Departments in light of the COVID crisis.  Its purpose is to allow key issues of relevance to the sectors to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by government (national or local), or by industry itself, to support the sectors.  The Forum enables the T&aacute;naiste and I to engage with a wide spectrum of industry stakeholders in order to assess the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to help improve understanding and responses to the crisis and to discuss ideas for recovery measures, thus assisting the Government in formulating its on-going response to the crisis. The forum has met three times to date i.e. in October 2020, December 2020 and March 2021 and is hugely beneficial in helping me to understand the particular concerns of each sector within tourism and hospitality.

The goal of this regulatory framework will be to tackle the availability of defined categories of harmful online content through systemic oversight over how certain online services deliver and moderate the user-generated content on their platforms.</p>  <p>  These defined categories of harmful online content include content by which a person commits a criminal offences and a number categories of potentially harmful content, these being:</p>  <p>   - Content by which a person engages in serious cyberbullying,</p>  <p>  - Content by which a person promotes suicide or self-harm, and, </p>  <p>  - Content by which a person promotes behaviour associated with eating disorders.</p>  <p>  These categories concerning potentially harmful content are carefully defined in the General Scheme to ensure that they deal with the most egregious content and respect other fundamental rights such as freedom of expression. These definitions are being refined during detailed legal drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  Provision is also made in the Bill for the addition of further categories of harmful online content in the future. This process will involve a proposal by the Media Commission, informed by stakeholder consultation and both Government and Oireachtas approval. The Media Commission will be tasked with keeping a close eye on emerging online harms which may be suitable to be dealt with under the regulatory framework for online safety. </p>  <p>  The purpose of this provision is to futureproof the legislation to create a statutory process by which emerging online harms such as the issue raised by the Deputy may be examined for potential inclusion as a further category of harmful online content. This will help to avoid the need for ad-hoc primary legislation to deal with emerging harms in the future.</p>  <p>  It's intended that the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will be enacted this year. The Bill is undergoing detailed drafting by the Office of the Attorney General and is on the Government priority list for publication during the current legislative session, which ends in July 2021. At the same time, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht is conducting pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the Bill. The timeline for this is a matter for the Committee.</p></reply>

In line with the plan set out in <i>The Path Ahead</i>the Government has been implementing a limited phased easing of some restrictions through the month of May. Later this month, the Government will make further decisions which should allow for the continued phased reopening of the music  and entertainment sectors  for the critical summer season, as the public health situation permits.</p><p>I am committed to supporting  culture  and tourism through this difficult period and to working towards reopening and recovery. In this regard, the Government will soon be publishing a National Economic Recovery Plan outlining how we will help people return to work and support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. </p><p>I allocated &euro;50 million to a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector.  &euro;25m has been allocated to Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS 2021) which has now closed for applications.  Over 400 applications had been received by the closing date of 14 April.  Assessment of applications to the scheme is underway and the results will be announced shortly. LPSS 2021 builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.</p><p>An allocation of &euro;14m is being made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  </p><p>Under the scheme, businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers - whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply. This scheme has been developed following wide consultation with the sector.  It is hoped that the MEBAS will open for applications shortly.</p><p>An allocation of &euro;5 million will be made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions continue to prevent live events. This funding will be allocated shortly.</p><p>&euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector.</p></reply>

I also wish to advise the Deputy that my colleague, Heather Humphreys TD,Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection addressed these matters on the 11 May 2021 and the written reply may be accessed at the following link </p><p>www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2021-05-11/535/#pq_535  </p><p>Access to participation in arts and culture is one of the cornerstones of national cultural policy. <i>Culture 2025</i>, published in January 2020, sets the direction for Government policy across the cultural sector, including the arts and the creative and audiovisual sectors. A number of key values underpin Culture 2025 including the right of everyone to participate in the cultural and creative life of the nation. </p><p>National Cultural Institutions also respond through their programmes to develop wider access including for people with disabilities. My Department will continue to work with the Council of National Cultural Institutions to encourage the development of access to all audiences.</p><p>Under the Arts Act 2003, primary responsibility for the promotion and support of the arts, including arts and disability, throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council. The Arts Council is independent in relation to its funding and executive decisions. The strategic context for the Arts Council&rsquo;s support of arts participation and all other artforms and areas of arts practice is set out in <i>Making Great Art Work: Arts Council Strategy (2016 &ndash;2025).</i>This strategy describes how the Council will lead the development of the arts in Ireland over this period.  This strategy has five priority areas: the artist; public engagement; investment strategy; spatial and demographic planning; and developing capacity.</p><p>The Arts Council also has specific supports for artists with disabilities.  The Arts Council&rsquo;s <i>Equality, Human Rights and Diversity [EHRD] </i>Policy builds on a range of existing Arts Council work areas, developments and policies including an Arts &amp;amp; Disability policy , a Cultural Diversity and the Arts policy , and a Dignity at Work policy . The policy is published on the Arts Council website and can be accessed at the following link </p><p>www.artscouncil.ie/uploadedFiles/EHRD%20Policy%20English%20version%20Final.pdf</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that all awards and schemes operated by the Arts Council are informed by the Arts Council&rsquo;s ten-year strategy (2016&ndash;25), <i>Making Great Art Work </i>as  well as the Arts Council&lsquo;s <i>Equality, Human Rights &amp;amp; Diversity</i>Policy &amp;amp; Strategy and <i>Paying the Artist</i>. </p><p>The Arts Council also fund a number of key agencies, who have a central role in supporting these areas of work including Arts and Disability Ireland as well as  Create; Age &amp;amp; Opportunity and Waterford Healing Arts Trust.</p></reply>

In general terms, officials of my Department routinely carry out scientific research, survey work and monitor compliance with national and European law in relation to nature conservation across the country. They conduct patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of national and EU legislation, as required, and many of these officers carry out work in more than one county. They also investigate reports of breaches of legislation including those related to turf cutting.</p>  <p>  Ireland, like all EU Member States, is bound by the requirements of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas. Ireland's approach is to recognise the traditional right to cut turf for domestic purposes, while balancing this with our obligations under the Habitats Directive. This balanced approach is based on a respect for and understanding of that tradition, and has been carefully nurtured to build trust and work with stakeholders to save the natural heritage of Ireland's bogs. </p>  <p>  Significant efforts have been made by the State and by turf-cutters to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas within the framework of the Habitats Directive. This has included the establishment of the Peatlands Council, intensive and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters.</p>  <p>  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017&ndash;2022 sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. This plan, as well as the National Peatlands Strategy, recognizes that domestic turf cutters have a traditional right to cut turf and that this right is balanced with the conservation objectives for designated raised bogs and the legal obligations on the State.</p></reply>

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned.  The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern and are being taken very seriously.  It is important that we establish the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response on the best knowledge and evidence available.  In order to better understand the issue, two separate pieces of research are being undertaken, each with a different focus.</p>  <p>  A review of homeless deaths is being undertaken on behalf of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) by Dr Austin O&rsquo;Carroll, the HSE appointed Clinical Lead for Covid-19 and Homelessness in Dublin.  The review, which the DRHE has indicated is due for completion imminently, aims to analyse the data concerning deaths in homeless services for 2020 to aid our understanding and identify learning for homeless and health services that could help tailor the provision of care to homeless people.</p>  <p>  While the information requested in respect of the number of deaths of homeless service users is not compiled in my Department, a separate feasibility study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. This is due to be completed by the end of 2021.  The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, is reviewing approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to ensure that all individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit into permanent housing solutions and that those with complex health and mental health needs are provided with the supports they need. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in respect of these issues.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs. It commits to the continued expansion of Housing First, and, importantly, ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided. The provision of addiction and mental health supports has featured prominently in meetings of the High Level Homelessness Task Force that I established and in my regular interactions with the Minister for Health. The issue of deaths in homeless services has also been discussed at the Task Force.</p>  <p>  Engaging with rough sleepers is vital.

In this context, the Programme for Government (PFG) committed to the development of a Town Centre First (TCF) policy.  With a view to giving effect to this commitment and the actions outlined in the PFG, a TCF Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) was established in November 2020 to consider the regeneration of our towns and villages. The IDG is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD).  The IDG has met three times since its inaugural meeting in November and will meet again later this week.  The aim is that the IDG will provide recommendations for consideration by Government in June.  It is envisaged that recommendations will cover the short, medium and longer-term out to 2040, to align with Project Ireland 2040.  It would be premature for the IDG to report to any sub-committee pending further development and finalisation of their work. </p><p>The Departments represented on the IDG are attached in Appendix 1, with members having been nominated by the relevant Secretaries General and notified to DRCD in their capacity as secretariat to the group.</p><p>  ">Appendix A</p><p>In parallel with the IDG, a Town Centre First Advisory Group was also established to enable the experiences of a broader group of stakeholders to be brought to bear in informing the process of policy development, and to support the work of the IDG. The Group comprises individual representatives from a broad range of sectors to ensure effective and diverse representation with the capacity and experience to contribute in a meaningful way to the preparation and implementation of a practical TCF framework.  </p><p>The Advisory Group has met twice to date and a further meeting is anticipated, following the next IDG scheduled later this week.  The work of the Advisory Group has been advanced primarily through written submissions and bi-lateral meetings with the co-chairs of the IDG and also the chairs of three IDG working groups that were also established to further inform and underpin the work of the Advisory Group and the IDG.  A list of the bodies represented on the Advisory Group is also attached in Appendix 1 and the minutes of the meetings of the Advisory Group are provided in Appendix 2.</p><p>  ">Appendix B</p><p>There is general consensus among all the groups that there is no one solution or issue that can or should be addressed in isolation but rather that a TCF framework should be holistic and capable of being tailored to address the individual needs, size and characteristics of a town.  Until such time as this work is further progressed and measures developed and agreed, it would be premature to comment further on specific proposals being considered.</p></reply>

A changing places toilet offers larger supported facilities that address the needs of people for whom current accessible sanitary accommodation is inadequate. These facilities enable people with complex care needs to take part in everyday activities such as travel, shopping, family days out or attending a sporting event.</p><p>The plenary Working Group has met four times to date, in addition to a number of sub-group meetings.

If an AHB is in receipt of funding under a scheme for the provision of social housing, they must comply with the terms and conditions of that scheme. Under such schemes, the AHB is required to make the property available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement. </p>  <p>  On expiry of the mortgage period and subject to compliance with the terms of the funding agreement, the AHB becomes the owner of the property. In accordance with Departmental Circular 19/2014, local authorities are requested to notify my Department on release of all mortgage charges to AHBs within their area. </p>  <p>  If a property is owned outright by an AHB and it is not subject to public funding, the AHB may choose to sell that property, once this is allowed for in their constitution. It should be noted that AHBs must have, as their primary objectives, the relief of housing needs, and the provision and management of housing included within their memorandum of association or registered rules, as the case may be. The vast majority of AHBs are registered charities and, as such, they must also comply with the provisions of the Charities Acts in relation to the sale of charitable assets.</p></reply>

My colleague, the Minister for Health, has responsibility for securing the supply of vaccines for Ireland through the EU procurement process. </p>  <p>  COVID-19 vaccines can only be approved and used if they comply with all the requirements of quality, safety and efficacy set out in the EU pharmaceutical legislation. No vaccine will be used until a Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is obtained and any authorised vaccine will be subject to ongoing monitoring in Ireland by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). </p>  <p>  The Commission signed six Advance Purchase Agreements (APA) with manufacturers prior to any COVID-19 vaccines receiving authorisation for use in the EU. To date, four of those vaccines, BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen/J&amp;J have received a CMA and are being supplied and administered as part of the rollout of Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccination programme. Ireland has the option to opt-in to the Sanofi APA, if and when the vaccine receives CMA. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the common EU approach to the procurement of vaccines, which ensures that our citizens get access to safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19. Without it, it is most unlikely smaller countries like ours would have the supply levels we are currently forecasting.</p></reply>

As Minister Coveney stated at the UN Security Council on 16 May, children must never be made prisoners of history.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a longstanding commitment to improving access to and the quality of education in the oPt. Education has been central to our international development programme in the oPt for many years and, along with a number of other donors, we work with the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s Ministry of Education (PA) to build the capacity of Palestinian educational institutions. This includes support for curriculum development and educational reform. Ireland invests &euro;3 million in this area annually.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also contributed &euro;6.85 million since 2019 to Education Cannot Wait (ECW), a global fund which supports the education needs of children and youth caught up in emergencies and protracted crises. ECW supports education in the oPt through a three-year educational response programme which was developed with the PA Ministry of Education, UN Agencies and other stakeholders.  ECW works through UNICEF to provide safe learning spaces, sanitation facilities, and training for teachers on child-centred teaching methods and special learning needs, as well as psychosocial support to children.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supports the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which is mandated to provide services &ndash; including education - to Palestine refugees across a number of fields of operation, including the oPt. 526,000 refugee children are educated in 711 UNRWA-run schools. In March of this year, Minister Coveney signed a three-year agreement with UNRWA under which we committed to provide the agency with &euro;6 million per year for three years to support their important work.</p>  <p>  In addition, each year Ireland provides Fellowships for young, high-potential Palestinians to study for a Master&rsquo;s Degree at an Irish Higher Education Institution. At present 25 of these Fellowships are awarded each year across a range of disciplines. </p>  <p>  In May 2021, Minister Coveney announced that Ireland would provide &euro;1.5 million in emergency humanitarian support for the oPt following the recent hostilities. This includes &euro;500,000 for UNICEF, which will be used for child protection, and the provision of medical and sanitation services to thousands of children in acute need. UNICEF will also provide emergency psycho-social services to 5000 children suffering trauma as a result of the hostilities. This will bring Ireland&rsquo;s total funding to UNICEF for its global work programme to &euro;7.7 million in 2021.</p>  <p>  The other &euro;1 million is additional support to UNRWA to assist it in providing emergency food, water and sanitation supplies, as well as health and psychosocial services for people affected by the hostilities. It brings Ireland&rsquo;s total funding to UNRWA in 2021 to &euro;7 million.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the plight of children is and will remain at the centre of our response to this ongoing emergency.</p></reply>

To change this, an amendment of the 1956 Act would be required.</p><p>The Department of Justice is responsible for citizenship matters. Any amendment to the 1956 Act is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs operates a clear and transparent general policy for processing FBR applications.

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or just under 25% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>It is my belief that children with special educational needs should receive their education in placements which are appropriate to their needs alongside their peers wherever possible unless such an approach would be inconsistent with the best interests of the individual child or other children in the school.  </p><p>This inclusive approach is consistent with the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.</p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for. </p><p>Most children with special educational needs receive their education in mainstream classes, many with additional teaching and care supports.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>There are planning processes in place at both local and national levels to ensure that the required number of specialist education places come on stream to meet identified need in a timely fashion. Normally, schools are very willing to respond to the emerging needs in their areas.</p><p>Where a shortage of places is identified, my Department works closely with the NCSE and the schools in the area to expand provision to meet local need.As Minister, I have powers under Section 37A of the Education Act to compel schools to open places but this is used sparingly and only after all reasonable efforts have been made to secure the cooperation of the schools concerned. </p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>I can also confirm that the local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

In subjects or modules where it is not specifically mentioned the topic of breastfeeding may occur during class conversation and through interactions with students.</p>  <p>  For example, from a nutritional aspect the subject of breastfeeding may come up in Post Primary Home Economics when discussing healthy lifestyles and nutritional requirements across all ages. In the Leaving Certificate Applied Childcare/Community care module on the care of babies and young children, Unit 1 addresses breast and bottle feeding. </p>  <p>  From a social aspect, Junior Cycle Home Economics includes Strand Two on exploring the roles and responsibilities of the family while Leaving Certificate Home Economics includes Topic 3.1.6: Family As A Caring Unit. In Leaving Certificate Applied Social Education,the module on Social and Health Education, Unit 2: Relationships &ndash; the topic may be covered while discussing parenting and the needs that children have at various stages of their development.</p>  <p>  Further relevant subjects would be within the SPHE curriculum. Junior Cycle SPHE Strand Two: Minding Myself and Others contains learning outcomes 2.3: describe what promotes a sense of belonging in school, at home and in the wider community and their own role in creating an inclusive environment and 2.4: distinguish between appropriate care giving and receiving. At Leaving Certificate level, SPHE aims to develop health literacy, both for the individual student and for groups. Health literacy is the capacity of individuals to obtain discerningly, interpret and understand health information; this includes the confidence to access health services and the competence to use such information and services in ways that enhance health. Once students&rsquo; health literacy skills are developed, they will be able to seek out relevant knowledge and information using a variety of sources including digital sources.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department of Health has produced a Breastfeeding Information Pack for Junior Cycle students in Irish Secondary Schools.</p>  <p>  The Information Pack was commissioned jointly by the Department of Health and the HSE Population Health Directorate, and developed by researchers from Health Promotion, Training &amp;amp; Support Services and Elm Training under the direction of a multidisciplinary, multisectoral expert advisory committee with representation from the relevant statutory and voluntary health services, SPHE coordinators and teachers from the relevant education sectors. The views and opinions of Junior Cycle students from a diversity of urban and rural schools were also pivotal in the development of the Information Pack.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the initiative is contained in Action 42 of &lsquo;Breastfeeding in Ireland: A Five Year Strategic Action Plan&rsquo; (Department of Health and Children, Oct. 2005), which recommended introducing breastfeeding information and promotion to schoolchildren at all levels of education within the context of the SPHE curriculum.</p></reply>

The NCCA have had continued engagement with member&rsquo;s of the deaf community in recent years and will continue this work in the context of the review and redevelopment of the Primary School Curriculum. 'Inclusive education and diversity' is one of the eight principles of teaching and learning proposed. One of the competencies proposed is 'Communicating and using language' which means being able to understand, interpret and use different forms of communication including gesture, expression, spoken language (English, Irish and other languages), printed text, broadcast media, and digital media. Phase one of the consultation on the draft Primary Curriculum Framework is complete. Phase two will take place in Q4 2021 during which the NCCA will be working with children, teachers, school leaders and parents, so there will be an opportunity for children and teachers who use ISL in schools to provide learning from their experiences in their engagement with the NCCA. It is expected that the finalised Framework will be published by end Q2 2022 and the specifications for individual curricula will be developed in the following years. </p><p>At post primary school level, The Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle. The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live, and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics. A link to the course is available at: languagesinitiative.ie/images/ISL/MFL_Gen_Spec_ISL_28_May__Short_Course.pdf<i>.</i></p><p>Currently, there are four modules on Sign Language available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. This course introduces students to Irish Sign Language and aims to develop their expressive and receptive communication skills. The course also develops awareness and appreciation of the Irish deaf community and its culture. There are four modules in this course. Deaf students may take all four modules instead of the Gaeilge and Modern Language courses. The first two modules of this course may be taken as elective modules by all students.</p><p>There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests </p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 996,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  Extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this is to maintain the policy of ensuring that social welfare expenditure is targeted to those who need it most. </p>  <p>  The assessment of means can vary from scheme to scheme depending on the nature and purpose of the scheme.  Sometimes, a certain amount of income, or income from particular sources, is not taken into account for a particular scheme.  This is known as an income disregard. </p>  <p>  There is an earnings disregard in place for recipients of Disability Allowance which allows people to earn up to &euro;120 per week (increasing to &euro;140 per week in June) and retain their full payment.  Only half of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are assessed in the means test.  This aims to achieve a balance between ensuring resources are targeted towards those with the greatest need while supporting people to take up employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  In addition, Disability Allowance is unique in the social welfare system as the first &euro;50,000 of capital (e.g. savings, shares, property) is disregarded in the capital means test.  This compares to &euro;20,000 for most other social assistance schemes. </p>  <p>  Legislation does not provide for a disregard for funding from grants for artists and as such, any awards made through these types of schemes are assessed as income in the means test.</p>  <p>  Any extension of means disregards would need to be examined in an overall budgetary context. </p></reply>

It is an offence to operate an ELC or SAC service without being registered with Tusla.  </p>  <p>  The Regulations set out the statutory requirements to register and operate a service, which include minimum adult-child ratios, minimum space requirements, minimum qualification levels for employees working with children in ELC services, Garda vetting of staff, and provision of facilities for rest and play.  </p>  <p>  It is open to any prospective ELC or SAC provider who meets the regulatory requirements to apply to Tusla to register their service. An application for registration must be submitted to Tusla at least 3 months before operation of the new service commences.

A number of investigations and processes are underway in the HSE and Tusla to determine the impact on all systems.

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme and reap the benefits of quality early learning and care. </p>  <p>  Under Level 7 of AIM, pre-school providers, in partnership with parents, can apply for additional capitation to fund extra support in the pre-school room or to enable a reduction in the adult-to-child ratio.  Where additional capitation is given to fund extra support in the pre-school room, the pre-school manager is responsible for recruiting a member of staff to take on this role or extending the hours of other staff in the service.</p>  <p>  As staff who are supported under AIM Level 7 work alongside other staff in the pre-school room to provide early learning and care on an inclusive basis for all children in the room, the minimum qualification requirement of a Level 5 award in early childhood care and education applies to all staff, including those recruited under AIM Level 7.</p>  <p>  Of the 1,439 pre-school providers currently in receipt of AIM level 7 funding, only 42 have reported to Pobal that they are impacted by recruitment difficulties under AIM level 7. While I acknowledge the challenges arising for children and services in those cases where recruitment difficulties have caused delays, I do not believe the data suggests there is a need to change the current AIM model. </p>  <p>  More broadly, actions under way to develop a Workforce Development Plan for the sector and to look at possible establishment of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) are intended to support providers to recruit and retain qualified staff. </p>  <p>  The Workforce Development Plan will set out plans for moving to a graduate-led workforce by 2028 and establishing a career framework for staff in early learning and care and school-age childcare, including role profiles, qualifications requirements and career pathways. A report on phase one of the work can be found at www.gov.ie/en/publication/26122f-workforce-development-plan-for-the-elcsac-sector/ . The final Workforce Development Plan report is due for publication by the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I began a short process to examine the possibility of regulating the pay and conditions of employment of practitioners in early learning and care and school-age childcare, and to examine the suitability of establishing a JLC for the sector. On foot of this process, the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail has written to the Labour Court, who are currently examining whether to establish a JLC. If established, a JLC could lead to an Employment Regulation Order, which would establish binding rates of pay and conditions for the sector, thus supporting recruitment and retention of staff.</p></reply>

The key objective of AIM is to support early learning and care providers to deliver an inclusive preschool experience, ensuring that children with a disability can fully participate in the ECCE Programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality pre-school education. AIM is based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting. It does not require any diagnosis, recognising that many children do not have a diagnosis of a disability when starting pre-school. </p>  <p>  As AIM responds to the needs of the child in the pre-school context, it is not limited to a specific number of places in any region of the country.</p>  <p>  AIM has seven levels of progressive support, moving from universal supports (levels 1-3) to targeted supports (levels 4-7), based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting they are attending. </p>  <p>  Universal supports under AIM include:</p>  <p>  - An Inclusion Charter for the Early Years Sector and updated Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines, a national training programme on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion.</p>  <p>  - A higher education programme in Leadership for Inclusion in Early Years Settings (LINC), the graduates from which may be employed as Inclusion Coordinators in a mainstream pre-school setting.</p>  <p>  Targeted supports under AIM include:</p>  <p>  - Expert early years educational advice and support from a team of dedicated Early Years Specialists. To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile. This looks at the strengths, abilities and needs of the child, as well as the strengths and needs of the preschool setting.</p>  <p>  - A programme of capital grants for specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations for pre-school settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  - Access to therapeutic services where they are critical to enable a child to be enrolled and to meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme, provided with the HSE.</p>  <p>  - Additional assistance in the preschool room to ensure a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme. AIM provides financial support to the pre-school provider where needed, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance. Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pres-chool setting.</p>  <p>  First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families, commits to continue to roll out AIM, and subject to an evaluation of AIM, to consider further enhancements or extensions to this initiative. This evaluation is currently underway and is expected to be completed by end 2021.</p>  <p>  The report of the Inter-Departmental Group in 2016 recommended that other specialist pre-school supports provided by the Department of Education and the Department of Health/HSE should remain in place at least during the initial years of AIM roll-out. This includes autism-specific pre-school services provided by the Department of Education which include:</p>  <p>  - 135 Autism Early Intervention Classes attached to primary schools for autistic children aged three and over.</p>  <p>  - A Home Tuition Scheme which provides funding towards 10 hours tuition for children under 3 years of age and 20 hours per week for children over 3 years of who cannot secure a placement in an early intervention class. Subject to conditions, Parents are free to use the grant to engage tutors to deliver tuition in their home or pre-school providers to deliver tuition in a group/pre-school setting. Such arrangements are essentially between the parents and the relevant provider.</p></reply>

This includes the UBU Your Place Your Space scheme which provides out-of-school supports in local communities to marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable young people between the age of 10 and 24. Within youth organisations supported under this scheme, young people are free to participate in a wide range of quality non-formal and informal educational activities, which address inequality, celebrate diversity, and promote inclusion. Among the key objectives of the scheme is the improvement of outcomes for young people in a range of policy areas including health, education and inclusion, and to improve access for young people to informal and non-formal educational, developmental, recreational and cultural opportunities.</p>  <p>  The UBU Your Place Your Space scheme is governed by the UBU Policy and Operating Rules, which pays cognisance to a number of different policy areas. In this regard, the scheme draws on both the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017&ndash;2021 and the Migrant Integration Strategy, as well as other inclusion and participation strategies aimed at young people. In this regard, there is a strong emphasis on integration within the scheme and the needs led approach allows for the ongoing identification of young people for entry into the scheme.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, all 16 Education and Training Boards across the country play a lead role is assisting my Department in the youth services area and they each employ a Youth Officer. The UBU scheme is underpinned by the Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement (APNASR) process. The APNASR Tool, which is utilised by every ETB, supports them to gather available demographic data and local knowledge to produce an area profile of their functional area. The ETB then carries out an analysis of the data to identify the needs of young people in that area. This results in a Service Requirement for new or existing projects that will be funded by the Department under UBU. The approach ensures that we can target supports to the young people most in need of intervention and that funding is allocated on the basis of evidence-informed need.</p>  <p>  The UBU scheme recognises that many young people are marginalised in today&rsquo;s society, including those from migrant, Roma and traveller backgrounds who are targeted for inclusion in the scheme. We very much appreciate the challenges Covid-19 has posed and is posing for young people from these communities, and my officials are in regular contact with youth sector representatives in relation to the impact of the pandemic and associated health restrictions. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to 30 National Youth Organisations  under a Youth Services Grant Scheme and many of these organisations have shown leadership and commitment to the integration agenda. </p>  <p>  My Department has continued to provide funding to organisations throughout Covid-19 to ensure that these young people continue to be engaged within the parameters of public health guidance. It is in recognition of the importance of supporting young people at this time that I have secured an additional &euro;5 million investment in youth services for 2021. This funding will support the delivery of universal and targeted youth services nationwide. This includes an increase for all UBU youth services and national organisations working with marginalised, vulnerable and disadvantaged young people. My officials will continue to work closely with youth organisations and will actively monitor the situation. </p></reply>

Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (NQF level 6-10) in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. The core allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million per annum which supports circa 14,000 students.  This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. As part of the package of COVID supports provided by Government last year, &euro;10 million was allocated to an Access Funding package of which &euro;8.1 million was allocated to the Student Assistance Fund. This brought the 2020 SAF allocation to &euro;18.2 million. It is difficult to estimate the cost associated with widening access to student assistance fund support for migrant, asylum seekers and undocumented students as data on the numbers involved is not collected by the HEA. If however an additional 1000 students were to receive the SAF at an average cost of &euro;657 per student the additional estimated cost would be &euro;657,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  My Department operates a student support scheme for persons in the protection process or at the leave to remain stage. The scheme provides supports to qualifying students which are similar to those available in the statutory based Student Grant Scheme administered by SUSI. </p>  <p>  The scheme was introduced in 2015 and provides supports along similar lines to the current Student Grant Scheme (the SUSI scheme) to eligible applicants who are in the protection system and who are either:</p>  <p>  - asylum applicants</p>  <p>  - subsidiary protection applicants</p>  <p>  - leave to remain applicants</p>  <p>  In August 2020, I announced a change to the scheme in which the rules of the scheme were relaxed and the scheme placed on a long term footing. The requirement for prospective applications to have attended three academic years in the Irish school system and to have obtained the Leaving Certificate in the State, is no longer required. Prospective applicants still have to meet the requirement to have been in the protection or leave to remain process for three years.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the Student Support Scheme for Asylum Seekers, prospective students have to meet a number of criteria, including a requirement to:</p>  <p>  - Meet the definition of a protection applicant or a person at leave to remain stage (other than those at the deportation order stage);</p>  <p>  - Have been accepted on an approved Post Leaving Certificate course or an approved undergraduate course; and</p>  <p>  - Have been part of an application for protection or leave to remain for a combined period of 3 years prior to the 31st of August of the first year of their course.</p>  <p>  - Have been resident in the State for a combined period of 3 years as at 31st August of their course.</p>  <p>  From the start of the 2021/22 academic year, international protection applicants who have permission to work and are seeking to access Post Leaving, will no longer have to pay international fees of &euro;3,600. </p></reply>

The matters raised are an internal matter for the University of Limerick (UL) and my Department is therefore not in a position to intervene in the related policies of the University.</p><p>Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions will deliver the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site. In accordance with Public Health advice, in the majority of circumstances it has also not been possible for students to undertake planned international travel as part of their chosen programme. While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p><p>I am very aware of the difficulties facing students during this pandemic.  In general there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. I would encourage all institutions to engage with students in relation to any issues, including fees.</p><p>In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 2020/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state.  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution. This builds on the additional supports announced in July including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education and an additional &euro;3m provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives.</p><p>Higher education institutions report that the actual cost of delivering such programmes has not reduced as a consequence of the pandemic and have experienced a range of additional costs in continuing to deliver programmes during the unique circumstances of the pandemic. In 2020 the Government has provided funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education for the academic year 20/21. This included &euro;150million in new funding and a re-prioritisation of &euro;18million. For the Education providers under the remit of my Department, the allocation includes funding towards Support to Front line response; Immediate ICT costs relating to online provision; Health and Safety Costs; Research costs and funds towards assisting the enrolment of International Students</p><p>Notwithstanding the above position, I sought additional information from University of Limerick which has advised that &ldquo;  <i>Changes in university teaching delivery has had a significant impact on the costs and benefits of higher and adult education. First, it changes the nature of a university&rsquo;s costs, reducing operational expenditure on utilities and services, but increasing the cost of IT services, staff training in new technologies and the provision of additional counselling and support services for students. On balance, the costs of higher education are higher in a blended model, and this has been reflected in additional government grants to universities.</i></p><p><i>The budgeting process and Masters programme pricing is completed by the Postgraduate Studies office in consultation with the faculty Deans. The eventual price of the Masters programme depends on a range of factors including the cost of delivery and the support structures including everything from administrative support to estate maintenance. The total fee after scholarships is approximately split 50/50 with central administration and the faculty. As an aside, scholarships for all programmes increased this year as a tacit acknowledgement of the impact of the pandemic. Within the Kemmy Business School, the fees received do not have a list of sub accounts where the monies are allocated to various costs.</i></p><p><i>The cost of the virtual workshop this year was significant and the time and effort put into the delivery of that workshop was equivalent or greater to the organisational effort for an international trip. For the KBS, the key task was to ensure that students achieved the learning outcomes as per our mandate from Higher Education Authority (HEA) and audited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). We are confident that these outcomes were achieved.</i></p><p><i>The cost of delivery between the international trip and virtual workshop or other alternatives cannot be distinguished. While it is true to say that some operational costs such as heat, light, etc. have decreased other costs have increased. These increased costs include considerable human and technological resources into pivoting to online delivery at very short notice. These costs are spread across the campus and it is not possible to allocate them to particular programmes.</i></p><p><i>Overall, responding to the pandemic has changed the way that we provide education, but it does not mean that either the cost of provision or the value of the student learning is diminished. Despite the very real challenges, we have continued to adapt our education delivery in order to teach, assess and graduate students with the same high qualifications and skills&rdquo;.</i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-26a.467.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600067#WRG07700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 214 together.</p><p>As the deputy will be aware, higher education institutions are autonomous bodies as set out in legislation and are responsible for the day-to-day management and operational affairs of the institution including the determination of postgraduate tuition fees and refund policies.  The matters raised are an internal matter for the University of Limerick (UL) and my Department is therefore not in a position to intervene in the related policies of the University.</p><p>Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions will deliver the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site. In accordance with Public Health advice, in the majority of circumstances it has also not been possible for students to undertake planned international travel as part of their chosen programme. While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p><p>I am very aware of the difficulties facing students during this pandemic.  In general there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. I would encourage all institutions to engage with students in relation to any issues, including fees.</p><p>In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 2020/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state.  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution. This builds on the additional supports announced in July including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education and an additional &euro;3m provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives.</p><p>Higher education institutions report that the actual cost of delivering such programmes has not reduced as a consequence of the pandemic and have experienced a range of additional costs in continuing to deliver programmes during the unique circumstances of the pandemic. In 2020 the Government has provided funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education for the academic year 20/21. This included &euro;150million in new funding and a re-prioritisation of &euro;18million. For the Education providers under the remit of my Department, the allocation includes funding towards Support to Front line response; Immediate ICT costs relating to online provision; Health and Safety Costs; Research costs and funds towards assisting the enrolment of International Students</p><p>Notwithstanding the above position, I sought additional information from University of Limerick which has advised that &ldquo;  <i>Changes in university teaching delivery has had a significant impact on the costs and benefits of higher and adult education. First, it changes the nature of a university&rsquo;s costs, reducing operational expenditure on utilities and services, but increasing the cost of IT services, staff training in new technologies and the provision of additional counselling and support services for students. On balance, the costs of higher education are higher in a blended model, and this has been reflected in additional government grants to universities.</i></p><p><i>The budgeting process and Masters programme pricing is completed by the Postgraduate Studies office in consultation with the faculty Deans. The eventual price of the Masters programme depends on a range of factors including the cost of delivery and the support structures including everything from administrative support to estate maintenance. The total fee after scholarships is approximately split 50/50 with central administration and the faculty. As an aside, scholarships for all programmes increased this year as a tacit acknowledgement of the impact of the pandemic. Within the Kemmy Business School, the fees received do not have a list of sub accounts where the monies are allocated to various costs.</i></p><p><i>The cost of the virtual workshop this year was significant and the time and effort put into the delivery of that workshop was equivalent or greater to the organisational effort for an international trip. For the KBS, the key task was to ensure that students achieved the learning outcomes as per our mandate from Higher Education Authority (HEA) and audited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). We are confident that these outcomes were achieved.</i></p><p><i>The cost of delivery between the international trip and virtual workshop or other alternatives cannot be distinguished. While it is true to say that some operational costs such as heat, light, etc. have decreased other costs have increased. These increased costs include considerable human and technological resources into pivoting to online delivery at very short notice. These costs are spread across the campus and it is not possible to allocate them to particular programmes.</i></p><p><i>Overall, responding to the pandemic has changed the way that we provide education, but it does not mean that either the cost of provision or the value of the student learning is diminished. Despite the very real challenges, we have continued to adapt our education delivery in order to teach, assess and graduate students with the same high qualifications and skills&rdquo;.</i></p></reply>

The new measures have been successful to date in preventing the block booking of appointments by third party agents. </p><p>However, some third party agents continue to provide appointment booking services in return for payment on the basis that the person provides them with their personal details in advance.

Department  officials worked closely with Chinese Customs to achieve that access and it is a market of significant interest to our industry. According to CSO trade data, the overall value of beef exports to China increased from &euro;65 million in 2018 to &euro;95 million in 2019 but declined markedly last year as a result of ongoing restrictions on beef imports.</p>  <p>  In May 2020, the Department identified and confirmed an isolated case of Atypical BSE. There is no public health risk associated with the incidence of Atypical BSE which is believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate and has only been identified in older cattle. The discovery of this rare atypical case exemplifies the strength of Ireland&rsquo;s controls and surveillance system. </p>  <p>  Following the confirmation of the Atypical BSE case, Ireland suspended shipments to China in accordance with the terms of the bilateral protocol governing the beef trade and pending a risk assessment by the Chinese customs authorities. </p>  <p>  Since last May, the Department, in collaboration with the Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, has engaged intensively with relevant Chinese officials to seek the resumption of trade. To assist the Chinese customs authorities in their deliberations, the Department promptly provided a comprehensive epidemiological report in June 2020, and submitted a further a detailed update on our official BSE controls in November 2020 at the request of the Chinese authorities. </p>  <p>  The Department has pursued official, diplomatic and political channels to present the case to the Chinese authorities for a restoration of trade on scientific and safety grounds. We have sought to resolve the issue through high-level correspondence, including three Ministerial letters and through correspondence between the Taoiseach and China&rsquo;s Premier.  </p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Martin Heydon, I have  raised the matter with China&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland in meetings last September and more recently in March. We will continue to utilise every available option for dialogue until the suspension is lifted.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, it must be recognised that the timing of the decision to resume trade remains a matter for the Chinese customs authorities. However, given the importance of the market for the sector, I continue to press the case for a resumption of beef exports to China whenever there is appropriate opportunity to do so.</p></reply>

The new Office will have a role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland and will incorporate the Enforcement Authority functions required by the Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) Directive.  Primary legislation is required to establish the new office as a separate statutory body. It is envisaged that the legislation will also provide for any further powers which may be given to the Office, including extending the rules set out in the UTP Directive.</p>  <p>  I signed the Statutory Instrument (SI) transposing Directive (EU) 2019/633, the Directive on Unfair Trading Practices, into law on 28th April last, the first step in the process of establishing the new Office of a National Food Ombudsman/Regulator or equivalent. SI No. 198 of 2021 transposes the Directive into Irish law directly as it stands, as secondary legislation in Ireland does not allow for changes to be made to the Directive. The Regulations will have effect from 1st July 2021.</p>  <p>  The next step requires the drafting of primary legislation to establish the Office and to provide for any further powers which may be given to that office. In that regard, a public consultation to seek views on these issues will close today, 26th May 2021. Department officials will examine all submissions received and will draft the legislation, following which the Bill will be presented to the Oireachtas.  It is hoped that the legislation will be finalised by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  The UTP Enforcement Authority will operate on an interim basis in the Department pending the finalisation of the primary legislation for the new Office when it will be incorporated into that Office. Currently, there are four officials working on UTP matters, equal to approximately three full time equivalent staff. Progress is being made on assigning a Head and others to specifically staff the UTP Enforcement Authority.  </p>  <p>  The work will be demand-led to some extent and resource requirements will depend on the level of complaints received.  I can assure you that I will ensure that appropriate resources are assigned to ensure an effective service is delivered.</p></reply>

It is a non-breeding herd which disposes of all cattle on the holding direct for slaughter and poses a minimal risk of infecting cattle on adjacent holdings by fulfilling at least one of the following three criteria:</p><p>1.the cattle are permanently housed (never on pasture)<b><i>or</i></b></p><p>2. there are no contiguous holdings with cattle<b><i>or</i></b></p><p>3. the boundaries are walled, double fenced or equivalent so as to prevent any direct contact with cattle on contiguous holdings.</p><p>When a herd meets the criteria to be regarded as a CFU under the TB Eradication Programme, the herd is restricted under the TB Regulations and a special official supervisory and testing protocol is established. Therefore, as CFU herds continue to be restricted on an on-going basis they are not counted as having outbreaks of TB and, as such, the information requested is not available. </p><p>Such herds are not exempted from testing, reactor removal or disinfection requirements. Restricted CFU herds are TB tested at least once a year. The CFU status arrangement allows the delivery of an effective level of disease risk management while controlling the risk of further disease spread in compliance with animal health legislation, and enabling business continuity in this particular type of enterprise through the inward movement of cattle.</p><p>Cattle from CFU herds restricted under the TB Eradication programme are only permitted to move to a EU approved slaughter plant. Cattle from CFUs may not be exported. </p></reply>

Our technical staff continue to operate and monitor all relevant systems to the highest levels and are closely engaged with experts in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the National Cyber Security Centre to ensure that we follow best practice as it relates to all aspects of IT security. </p>  <p>  For reasons of operational and national security, it is not be appropriate to disclose specific details of the Department&rsquo;s IT Security arrangements, or those of State Agencies under my remit. Any specific information in relation to cyber security tools and services could assist criminals in identifying potential vulnerabilities in cybersecurity arrangements and therefore it is not considered appropriate to disclose any such detail or make comment which could in any way compromise the Department&rsquo;s IT Security.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-26a.547.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052600069#WRJ01000"><p>In June 2020, the Department launched the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) (Ash dieback).  The objectives of the scheme are to encourage the active management of ash plantations, to promote the vigorous growth of ash through thinning and, where appropriate in young plantations and in cases of high disease infection, to support the removal of the affected ash crop and replacement with alternative species.  The Scheme also aims to build resilience and diversity into plantations and possibly identify tolerant or resistant individuals.</p>  <p>  The support scheme for Ash Dieback has been reviewed to ensure the continued relevance of the  Departments response and to ensure that the forest owner is provided with a broader range of silvicultural and management options, to deal with the disease in ash trees.  As other tree species are not affected by the disease, it is not necessary to include other species in the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) (Ash dieback).  Applicants are free to replant with other tree species, within the Scheme criteria.</p>  <p>  To date, the Department has received 304 applications for RUS for 1,252ha, of which 61 have been approved for 214ha.  The remainder are at various stages of processing. I have no plans to redraft the scheme at this stage. </p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and is administered through the Local Authorities.</p><p>In any given year, the demand under the scheme exceeds the funding availabile.  It is a matter for each Local Authority to prioritise roads for inclusion under the scheme.</p><p>As part of &ldquo;Our Rural Future&rdquo;, the Government committed to ensuring that the Local Improvement Scheme is funded into the future. I launched the 2021 Local Improvement Scheme on May 14<sup>th</sup>with funding of &euro;10.5 million. This represents a 5% increase in funding compared to last year. The funding will improve access to rural homes and farms, as well as outdoor amenities such as lakes, rivers, mountains and beaches.</p><p>Over &euro;68 million has now been invested under the Local Improvement Scheme since it was re-introduced in 2017. Close to 2,400 roads have been funded for repair works. This has made a real difference to the lives of over 10,000 landowners and residents in rural Ireland.</p><p>As I noted when I launched the 2021 Local Improvement Scheme, I am working to identify if additional funding can be provided for the Scheme in 2021 as it is clear that there is a continuing demand for this funding in rural communities across Ireland. </p><p>Finally, in relation to specific aspects of <i>Sc&eacute;im na mB&oacute;ithre &Aacute;ise</i>, or Gaeltacht Accommodation Roads scheme, the Deputy may wish to contact the the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media for further details.</p></reply>
