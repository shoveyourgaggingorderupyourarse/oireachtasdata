    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-13a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300058#WRA00600"><p>The Fuel Allowance is a payment of &euro;33 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;924 each year) from late September to April, which is currently supporting more than 370,000 households at an estimated cost of &euro;366 million.  </p><p>As part of the overall welfare Budget 2023 package of &euro;2.2 Billion, a number of significant reforms were made to the Fuel Allowance scheme.  Up to 81,000 new households will benefit from a major expansion of Fuel Allowance Scheme from January 2023.  These reforms include:</p><p>-  A new means threshold will be introduced for people aged 70 years and over.  The new means threshold will be &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple.</p><p>-  The weekly means threshold for those aged under 70 will be increased by &euro;80 to &euro;200 above the appropriate rate of State Pension (Contributory).</p><p>-  The Disablement Benefit payment will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes.  A household will also no longer be debarred from receiving Fuel Allowance because a person in the household is in receipt of Disablement Benefit.</p><p>-  The Half-Rate Carer's Allowance payment will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes.</p><p>It is incorrect to say that the Fuel Allowance is not available to Benefit recipients.  In fact, it is available to recipients of long-term benefit payments including pensioners and people with disabilities and the changes I have just listed will increase the number of households on these schemes that will benefit from the payment.</p><p>Some short-term benefit payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit, Illness benefit and Maternity Benefit are not, however, qualifying payments for Fuel Allowance.  The reason for this is that Fuel Allowance is intended as a support for households with a long-term dependence on welfare payments.  The  schemes just mentioned are short-term payments for those who suffer a short period of interruption to their employment.  These payments are not means-tested; the recipients still have an attachment to the labour force and there is an expectation that they will return to the workforce.</p><p>It is also important to note that households in receipt of benefit payments, including those not eligible for Fuel Allowance, will benefit from the enhanced electricity credit of &euro;600 which will be applied to electricity bills, &euro;200 before Christmas and the remainder (in two tranches) early in the New Year.  These households will also benefit from the double week in social welfare payments in October and December.</p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Service.</p></reply>

The WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents, and to offer a financial incentive to take up employment.</p>  <p>  It is a targeted measure that is directly linked to household income and therefore directly supports low-income working families.  There are approximately 45,000 families with 99,000 children who are currently in receipt of WFP.  The estimated spend of WFP in 2022 is &euro;349 million.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 included the provision of a once off &euro;500 cost of living lump sum payment to all WFP recipients and is due to be paid in the week commencing 14th November.</p>  <p>  An increase in the income thresholds applicable to WFP customers was also announced in Budget 2023.  This increase will take effect from 5th January 2023 and will see the income limit for all family sizes increase by &euro;40.  This will see an increase in payment across all awarded claims of &euro;24 per week while also increasing the income qualification thresholds for claimants.</p>  <p>  The number of applications for the Working Family Payment reduced during the pandemic but since January 2022 applications have returned to pre pandemic levels. </p>  <p>  There is no fixed payment rate for the Working Family Payment with the payment to each applicant being dependent on their employment earnings and their household composition.  Each applicant receives a payment unique to their own circumstances.  Therefore, each application needs to be reviewed carefully to calculate this payment and evidence of earnings must be submitted and verified. </p>  <p>  There are currently 5,531 new applications pending.  The average processing time for new Working Family Payment applications is currently 4 weeks and over 97% are cleared within 6 weeks.  This represents an improvement of 2 weeks in average processing time compared to the pre-covid, 2019 performance.  Renewal applications are processed prior to the expiry of the current claim. </p>  <p>  The easiest and fastest ways for customers to make an application for Working Family Payment is online via mywelfare.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-13a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300058#WRA01200"><p>As I outlined in my earlier reply, I and my Department are committed to the provision of in-person Community Welfare Services around the country.  This is clear from the fact that staffing levels have been maintained in the Community Welfare Service nationwide in recent years, even as demands on the service decreased due to the transfer of most rent allowances to the local authorities and the general improvement in economic conditions.  This reflects my commitment to continue to support the delivery of in-person services to citizens.  There are currently over 400 staff working in the Community Welfare Service throughout the country.</p>  <p>  My Department has also introduced a number of innovations this year with the aim of increasing service capacity and modernising and improving the Community Welfare Service.  The measures introduced are intended to ensure a permanent full-time CWO presence in over 50 of our local offices, expand the range of service access options for clients, and reduce the administrative workload on CWOS, so freeing up front line staff to make them available to deal personally with clients.</p>  <p>  These changes together with the maintenance of staffing levels has led to the CWS being in a stronger position to respond to increases in the demand for the service than might otherwise have been the case. </p>  <p>  This is important given that there has been a significant increase, of about 60%, this year in the level of applications received for Additional Needs Payments.  While people will always question process and organisation change the fact that the service has delivered over 60% more payments this year than last and that 75% of claims received via the new national freephone line are determined without the need for a client to ever visit a physical office bear testimony to the effectiveness of the changes.</p>  <p>  In addition to improving the accessibility and capacity of the service we are also concerned to ensure that it is adequately staffed.  Accordingly, I am pleased to say that as part of the estimates process the Department secured approval for an additional 289 staff in 2023.  It is intended that some of these staff will be allocated to help further improve CWS capacity.  I expect recruitment for these posts to begin shortly.</p>  <p>  It is timely to acknowledge the huge efforts of our network of Community Welfare Officers throughout the country to support people at what is a very difficult time and I know too that they have been assisting following the tragedy in Creeslough last Friday.</p>  <p>  I want to be absolutely clear that the service continues to provide local access to local CWOs in local areas across the country and that there are no plans to change this.</p></reply>

A detailed explanatory paper on the new system has been published on www.gov.ie.</p><p>The system is expected to become operational in early 2024 and will automatically enrol approximately 750,000 employees at the outset.  These are employees who are aged between 23 and 60 years, earning over &euro;20,000 across all their employments, and who are not already enrolled in an occupational pension scheme. </p><p>The implementation phase is now well underway, with a project team in the Department of Social Protection progressing a range of individual elements of a detailed project plan, which includes setting out the system&rsquo;s operational design and drafting the legislation that will be required to underpin the new system. </p><p>In terms of the legislative elements of the project, the Government recently approved a General Scheme for an Automatic Enrolment Bill.  This General Scheme has been drafted in line with the final design principles document that I announced last March.  Just last week, I wrote to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, in order for that Committee to commence pre-legislative scrutiny of the Heads of the Bill. </p><p>In tandem with this process, my officials are working with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to draft the Automatic Enrolment Bill, which I hope to introduce to the Oireachtas as soon as possible following completion by the Committee of its work.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-13a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300058#WRA01800"><p>To address the impact that the recent increases in global energy prices is having on households, the Government, earlier this year, introduced a &euro;2.4 billion package of supports, with a further package of one-off measures worth &euro;2.5 billion in Budget 2023.  This includes a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through which energy credits totalling &euro;600 will credited to each domestic electricity account, including Pay as You Go accounts, in November 2022, January 2023 and March 2023.</p>  <p>  I want to be clear that pay-as-you go customers will benefit from these credits.  They will be applied to their pay-as-you-go account just as they were earlier this year.</p>  <p>  I also understand that a protocol is in place via MABS whereby vulnerable pay-as you go customers will not be disconnected by their supplier if they cannot top-up their pay-as-you-go card.</p>  <p>  In response to the on-going cost-of-living pressures, as part of Budget 2023, I secured a social welfare package of &euro;2.1billion, the largest Social Protection package in the history of the state.  Some &euro;1.1billion of this package has been targeted to provide a wide range of lump-sum payments in order to help people in the coming months, in addition to a wide range of increases which will come into effect from January 2023. </p>  <p>  Post budget analysis from the ESRI shows that the combination of these payments plus the energy credits will serve to compensate low-income households from previous and projected energy price increases.</p>  <p>  There may of course be exceptions.  Accordingly, Minister Ryan is meeting with the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities and with all energy suppliers over the coming weeks on a range of issues, including the importance of customer protection and supports.  The position of pay-as-you-go customers will be raised at these meetings and Minister Ryan will be looking for assurances and practical ways in which they can be protected.</p>  <p>  Additional guidance was issued in June to the Community Welfare staff of my Department on the administration of additional payments recommending that a flexible approach be taken to meet the income needs of vulnerable individuals and families who find themselves in difficulty meeting the higher costs of fuel and energy.  A public information campaign was also initiated to assist those who are experiencing financial difficulty to access help through Additional Needs Payments.</p>  <p>  Given the significant level of support provided for in the Budget, I expect that the vast majority of people will not need further support.  However, the Additional Needs Payments are available for those who need it.</p></reply>

Spending on these payments in 2022 is expected to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.  </p><p>The means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with the greatest need. </p><p>Based on the number of carers identified as part of Census 2016, it is estimated that a universal, non-means tested, carer&rsquo;s payment could cost an additional &euro;1.2 billion per annum. </p><p>In Budget 2022, I announced significant improvements to the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  The weekly income disregard was increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 a week for single carers and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse or partner.  These are the highest income disregards in the social welfare system and this increase enables more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for the scheme.</p><p>The capital disregard was also increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.  This allows carers who have accumulated savings to retain an entitlement to Carer's Allowance.  These changes, which came into effect in June this year, were the first changes that had been made to the Carer's Allowance means test in 14 years.</p><p>As part of the Budget 2023 cost of living package, Carer's Allowance recipients will benefit from two double week payments valued, for full-time carers at a minimum of &euro;448 as well as a &euro;500 lump sum, over the coming months.  There will also be an increase of &euro;12 in the weekly payment from January.</p><p>Given the need to target available resources fairly and equitably to those in most need, any further changes to the Carer's Allowance means test would have to be considered in an overall policy and Budgetary context.</p><p>I and my officials will continue to meet and discuss issues facing carers through our ongoing bilateral discussions with the community and voluntary sector and representative groups.</p></reply>

The Policy is supported by 150 commitments across Government, which will address the challenges facing communities and deliver new opportunities for people living in rural areas.</p>  <p>  The policy will help rural Ireland to recover from the impacts of Covid-19, enable long-term development of rural areas, and create more resilient rural economies and communities for the future.  It is an ambitious five year whole of Government policy for the future development of rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) is an income support scheme for farmers and fishers who are in receipt of specified social welfare payments, and who are underemployed in their primary occupation.  The scheme offers participants the opportunity to gain valuable work experience, while providing services to local communities.  To qualify for RSS, a person must be actively farming or fishing, and satisfy the means test assessment required to qualify for the Farm Assist (FA) payment.   </p>  <p>  During 2017 and 2018 the number of places available on RSS was increased by 750, bringing the total number of places available up to 3,350.  As at the end of September 2022, there were 2,869 participants availing of RSS with some 481 RSS places still available.  Intreo offices continue to promote RSS - but it is primarily a demand led scheme.  Current participation rates indicate that the number of available places is sufficient to meet current demand for places on the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Last June, Minister Humphreys and I introduced a series of reforms to support CE and RSS schemes and participants.  These included removing the six year time limit for participants on RSS, which will benefit 920 participants and will ensure that schemes can retain current participants who are delivering important services in rural communities.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor RSS and the numbers of participants availing of this valuable income support programme, including qualifying criteria.  Should the demand for RSS places exceed the number of places available during the course of the Rural Development Plan, then my officials will seek to raise the matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to consider any additional funding required to further expand the RSS and build on the good work.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to review all aspects of its income and employment support programmes to ensure their most effective delivery and the best outcomes for both participants and communities.  </p>  <p>  We will be starting a process before the end of the year on a wider review of RSS and part of that will be exploring opportunities to grow the scheme.</p></reply>

As the actuarial value of the State Pension is currently estimated at approximately &euro;380,000, it is reasonable to require people claiming a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over the term of their working life, before qualifying for a payment.  The requirement for eligibility criteria in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory) was endorsed by the Commission on Pensions.</p><p>It should be noted that, if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for a contributory State Pension, he or she may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% of the rate of the State Pension (Contributory). </p><p>Alternatively, an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is paid, generally, where a pensioner has an adult dependent who does not have enough contributions to claim a maximum rate contributory State Pension his or her own right.  The payment rate for the IQA is up to 90% of a full contributory pension.  The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances</p><p>In September, I announced a series of landmark reforms to the State Pension system in response to the recommendations from the Commission on Pensions.  The set of measures represent the biggest ever structural reform of the Irish State Pension system.</p><p>One of the key measures is the introduction of a flexible pension system in Ireland.  Under this new system, from January 2024, people will still be able to retire at 66 and draw-down their pension in exactly the same way as they can today.  In addition, there will be new flexibility so that people can choose to defer their pension, work longer and receive a higher pension payment.</p><p>The flexible State Pension system is about providing people with choice.  People will decide for themselves what best suits their needs and circumstances.  For example, in the case of a person who reaches age 66 and does not have sufficient contributions to qualify for a full pension, they will now have the option to work for longer to build up additional entitlements.  If a person has less than 10 years PRSI reckonable paid contributions, they can use this period to establish entitlement.  A person will also have the option to continue working between age 66 and 70 and receive an actuarially based increase in their weekly payment rate.</p><p>In addition, I have also indicated my intention and secured Government approval to examine options to provide early access to a pension for a person with a long work history who cannot, for health reasons, remain in their current occupation.  I expect to bring forward proposals on this matter in 2023.</p><p>In the meantime, people under the age of 66 who cannot work for health reasons can apply to avail of the Invalidity Pension and Disability Allowance schemes.</p><p>I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These credits will be added to their pay-as-you-go account in the same manner that the energy credit from Spring of this year was provided.</p><p>I also understand that a protocol is in place, via MABS, whereby vulnerable pay-as you go customers will not be disconnected by their supplier if they cannot top-up their pay-as-you-go card.</p><p>In addition, Minister Ryan, whose Department has overarching responsibility for the regulation of energy utilities, is meeting with the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities and with all energy suppliers over the coming weeks on a range of issues, including the importance of customer protection and supports.  The vulnerability of pay-as-you-go customers will be discussed at these meetings and Minister Ryan will be looking for assurances and practical ways in which they can be protected.</p><p>As part of Budget 2023, I secured &euro;2.1billion, the largest Social Protection package in the history of the state.  Some &euro;1.1billion of this package has been targeted to provide a wide range of lump-sum payments in order to help people in the coming months, in addition to a wide range of increases which will come into effect from January 2023.  The Budget measures include:</p><p>-  The Autumn Cost-of-Living Double Week Payment to most Social protection schemes which will be paid during the week commencing 17th of October 2022;</p><p>-  The Double Payment of Child Benefit to support families with children will be paid alongside the regular Child Benefit Payment in November 2022;</p><p>-  A &euro;400 Lump Sum Fuel Allowance Payment to all households receiving the Fuel Allowance;</p><p>-  A &euro;200 Lump Sum Payment for pensioners and people with a disability receiving the Living Alone Allowance;</p><p>-  A &euro;500 Lump Sum Payment to families in receipt of the Working Family Payment;</p><p>-  A &euro;500 Lump Sum Payment to those on Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and Invalidity Pension;</p><p>-  A &euro;500 Lump Sum Payment to those in receipt of the Carer's Support Grant.</p><p>In addition, a 100% Christmas Bonus will be paid to all long-term social welfare recipients in December 2022.</p><p>Analysis from the ESRI indicates that the combination of these payments and the energy credits insulates low-income households from the effects of inflation, including energy price increases.</p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department can make additional needs payments to help meet expenses that a person cannot pay from their weekly income.  Additional guidance was issued in June to the Community Welfare Service staff of my Department on the administration of additional needs payments recommending that a flexible approach be taken to meet the income needs of vulnerable individuals and families who find themselves in difficulty meeting the higher costs of fuel and energy. </p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place which will direct callers to the appropriate office. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p><p>The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To qualify for the Fuel Allowance payment, a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including the household composition criteria.  This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty, including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p><p>An adult child of a householder moving back into the family home may result in a reduction of additional allowances such as the Fuel Allowance payment previously held by the householder.  However, the economies of scale from living together should mean that a contribution towards household costs by the person moving in would compensate for any such reduction in payments from my Department. </p><p>A change in the qualifying criteria such as that proposed by the Deputy, disregarding the income of the returning family member, would change the targeted nature of the scheme and would likely result in payments being directed to households with significant income. </p><p>Therefore, my Department is not considering any proposals to amend the Fuel Allowance qualifying criteria in the manner outlined by the Deputy.</p><p>There will always be exceptional cases and it is for this reason that the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme was introduced.  In the event that the return of a family member into the household results in a reduction in Fuel Allowance payment, with no compensating contribution by the family member, then a payment may be made in the form of a heating supplement under this scheme.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition, Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payments will be disregarded for Fuel Allowance means assessment purposes.  </p>  <p>From January 2023, there will be a new means threshold for people aged 70 and over, of &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple.  This represents a significant expansion of the means test for this cohort.  Applicants aged 70 and over no longer have to be in receipt of a qualifying payment to access Fuel Allowance, provided they satisfy the means test and the household composition rules.</p>  <p>Many of these households will also benefit from the additional cost of living payments which will be paid between now and the end of the year.

Under the new means test, a single person over 70 can have income of &euro;500 per week and a couple can have income of &euro;1,000 per week and still qualify for Fuel Allowance.  This was a priority for me as part of Budget 2023 and is in recognition of the fact that older people are more vulnerable to the cold.</p><p>  Also, from January 2023, the standard means test for persons under 70 will be increased by &euro;80 from &euro;120 to &euro;200 over the maximum State Pension Contributory.  In addition, the half-rate Carer's Allowance payment and Disablement Benefit will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes.

My Department is already working on developing the IT systems and operational requirements to give effect to these changes. </p><p>As part of the Government's cost of living measures in Budget 2023, I announced that, in November 2022, a further lump sum payment of &euro;400 will be paid to Fuel Allowance recipients to alleviate the burden of rising energy prices and inflation.  This further lump sum payment will be available to households that have an entitlement to the fuel allowance payment on the week that the lump sum payment is paid.  While the lump sum payment will not be available to households that qualify for the fuel allowance payment in January, by qualifying for the Fuel Allowance payment they will be receiving an extra &euro;924 in a full fuel season to help with the cost of heating their home.</p><p>Some of the households to whom access is extended from January may also benefit from cost-of-living measures announced in the Budget such as the double week in social welfare payments in October and December and the living alone payment of &euro;200 in November.  The enhanced electricity credit of &euro;600 is another important Government measure announced in the Budget.  This will also benefit households to whom access to Fuel Allowance is extended to from January.  The first &euro;200 will be applied to electricity bills before Christmas.  As the eligibility for Fuel Allowance has been significantly enhanced, and will require time to implement, the extended eligibility will take effect in January 2023.</p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.

This measure provides targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2023 I am increasing the IQC rates by &euro;2 &ndash; to &euro;42 per child for under 12s and to &euro;50 per week for over 12s.  Over the last three Budgets, these rates have increased by &euro;6 and &euro;10 respectively.</p>  <p>  These increases were provided in the context of an overall package which included a &euro;12 rate increase for weekly schemes, in addition to &euro;1.1 billion in once-off measures to help ease the cost-of-living pressures for low-income households.  For example, a lone parent with two children will see a &euro;16 increase in their weekly rate from January.  The improvements to the Working Family Payment thresholds also targets low-income families with children, resulting in a weekly increase of up to &euro;24.</p>  <p>  Families will also be assisted before January.  They will receive a cost-of-living double payment later this month, and again in December via the Christmas bonus.  In November, an additional Child Benefit payment will be made.  Households in receipt of the fuel allowance will receive a &euro;400 lump sum, and people in receipt of the Working Family Payment will receive a lump sum of &euro;500.  All households will also benefit from &euro;600 of Energy Credits in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The ESRI post-Budget analysis shows that Budget 2023, combined with one-off measures to reduce the cost of living, will be effective in protecting most households from rising prices this winter.</p>  <p>  The analysis further shows that the income of lone parent households will remain essentially stable as a consequence of Budget 2023 measures which indicates that the Government measures are, in the main, effective at protecting lone parent households from the impact of significant levels of inflation. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am very mindful that lone parents continue to be a group with a high risk of poverty and for that reason I was particularly pleased to provide a number of measures in Budget 2023 which will be of benefit to lone parents.</p>  <p>  Recipients of One-Parent Family Payment and Jobseeker's Transitional Payment will be amongst those who receive a double weekly payment in October and a Christmas bonus double payment in December.  Like all families with children, lone parents will receive a double payment of Child Benefit in November.  Lone parents in receipt of the Fuel Allowance will also receive a lumpsum payment of &euro;400 in November. </p>  <p>  Approximately half of the payments of the &euro;500 cost of living lump sum payment which will be made to recipients of the Working Family Payment in November will be made lone parents.</p>  <p>  I have also provided for a &euro;40 increase in the weekly income thresholds for the Working Family Payment from January.  The personal rate of working age payments such as One-Parent Family Payment will increase by &euro;12, from &euro;208 to &euro;220 per week, also from January.  In addition, the rate of Increase for a Qualified Child will increase by &euro;2 to &euro;42 per week in respect of a qualified child under age 12 and by &euro;2 to &euro;50 per week in respect of a qualified child aged 12 or over.  As a result, these rates will have increased by &euro;6 for under 12s and by &euro;10 for over 12s over the last three Budgets. </p>  <p>  While income supports are important, access to affordable and available services such as housing, health, childcare, and education, plays an equally strong and potentially more sustainable role in addressing poverty.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy is referring to the Budget 2023 Minimum Essential Standard of Living Impact Briefing prepared by the Vincentian Research Centre.  However, it is important to note that this is just one analysis of the impact of the Budget package on households.  </p>  <p>  The ESRI analysis of Budget 2023 shows that the income of lone parent households will remain essentially stable as a consequence of Budget 2023 measures, with less than 0.2 per cent reduction, indicating that the Government measures are, in the main, effective at protecting lone parent households from the impact of the significant levels of inflation.  The Budget 2023 Expenditure Report notes that lone parent households stand to benefit from a &euro;1,872 annual increase in support.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance, in its analysis of the distributional impact of the tax and social welfare package of Budget 2023, found that single retirement age households and lone parents gain proportionally the most from both the Cost of Living Measures package and the 2023 package, with social welfare measures contributing the most to these gains. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to the reduction of all forms of poverty, in particular for children as outlined in the Programme for Government, and to the continued support of children and families across the country.</p></reply>

This rise in the number of applications reflects, at least in part, the efforts the Department has implemented, including two major advertising campaigns, to increase awareness of the payments.</p><p>In the region of 63% of all applications are being finalised within 4 weeks.  This reflects the need to verify household income and expenditure and assess whether or not the expenditure in respect of which the ANP is requested is essential.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p><p>The Fuel Allowance is paid to social welfare recipients such as pensioners, people with disabilities, lone parents and long-term unemployed people in recognition of their long-term financial dependence on their social welfare payment for all or most of their income.  </p><p>People on long term payments are unlikely to have additional resources of their own and are more vulnerable to poverty, including energy poverty.  It is for this reason that the Department allocates additional payments, supports and resources such as Fuel Allowance to this cohort of claimants.</p><p>The Working Family Payment (WFP) is a weekly, tax-free payment available to employees with children. It gives extra financial support to families with children with rates depending on their incomes and family size.  It is not considered a long-term Social Protection payment and recipients are in full time employment and are more likely to have additional resources.  A person in receipt of the WFP can continue to receive the payment for 52 weeks even if their income increases. </p><p>While no provision was made in Budget 2023 to allow persons in receipt of the WFP to access the Fuel Allowance payment as part of the overall social welfare Budget 2023 package of &euro;2.2 Billion, I was pleased to announce a number of measures in relation to the WFP.  In November 2022, people receiving the WFP will get a once-off payment of &euro;500 and in January 2023, the WFP income limits will increase by &euro;40 across all family sizes.</p><p>For people parenting alone and who are on a social welfare scheme such as the One-Parent Family Payment, they may also receive the double-week payment in October and the Christmas Bonus in December.</p><p>Many of those on the WFP will also benefit from the non-social welfare cost of living measures announced in the Budget such as the<b></b>enhanced electricity credit of &euro;600 which will be applied to electricity bills.</p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.

The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. </p>  <p>  Means tests are kept under regular review and a number of significant changes have been made in recent years.  In particular, I have introduced a number of changes to means testing which provide for higher income disregards.  These disregards ensure that, where people are in receipt of a social assistance payment and are working, a certain level of income from that work is not assessed in the means test.</p>  <p>  A maximum rate is payable where a person has limited or no means, and tapering applies to the rate payable to those with modest or more substantial means.  This is because there is an expectation that those with resources can at least partly contribute towards supporting themselves.</p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation provides that, for social assistance schemes, income and capital (such as savings, investments and property other than the family home) belonging to the claimant and his or her partner, where applicable, is assessable for means assessment purposes.</p>  <p>  How capital is assessed can vary depending on the nature and purpose of the payment, and various disregards apply across the schemes, reducing the amount of means assessed.</p>  <p>  For most social assistance schemes, the first &euro;20,000 of capital is fully disregarded, the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand. </p>  <p>  For Disability Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, the first &euro;50,000 of capital is fully disregarded.  The Disability Allowance capital disregard was increased to &euro;50,000 in 2007 in recognition of the fact that a person who is in receipt of Disability Allowance may not have had the opportunity to accumulate savings and that, in some circumstances, families may wish to make future financial provision for a child or sibling but are concerned that such provision would adversely affect their entitlement to Disability Allowance.</p>  <p>  I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance disregard in Budget 2022 for similar reasons; family carers may decide to provide for the future care of children or adults with disabilities.  Increasing the disregard in line with Disability Allowance allows for the planning of future care needs.</p>  <p>  Recently, as part of Budget 2023 I introduced significant changes in the means test for Fuel Allowance, including an increase in the overall threshold to &euro;200 over the relevant State Pension (Contributory) rate - an increase of &euro;80 in the allowable means. </p>  <p>  Further to this, I made additional targeted changes, in relation to disregarding income from Disablement Benefit and Half Rate Carers allowance, in the means test for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that these changes, combined, will help more than 17,000 additional households to qualify for Fuel Allowance next year. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the capital disregards would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p></reply>

The report also made clear that the cost of disability has implications for many areas of public policy, with additional costs of disability arising across a number of areas of expenditure including housing, equipment, aids and appliances, care and assistance services, mobility, transport, communications, medicines, and additional living expenses.  </p><p>Furthermore, Indecon found that there is not a single typical cost of disability; rather, there is a spectrum from low to high additional costs of disability, depending on individual circumstances.  </p><p>This is why the Government referred the report to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, which is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability.  This group comprises of relevant departments, agencies, a Disability Stakeholder Group and people with disabilities.  The group is tasked with considering and monitoring recommended actions that are required by the various Government Departments on foot of the report.</p><p>A number of the measures I introduced as part of Budget 2023 in support of people with disabilities and carers, reflect some of the findings of the report and will go towards alleviating some of the costs experienced.  These Budget measures are:</p><p>In October:</p><p>-  A Cost of Living Double Payment will be paid to Social Protection recipients including all Pensioners, Carers and people on Disability Payments.</p><p>In November, there will be a:</p><p>-  &euro;400 Lump Sum Fuel Allowance Payment to all households receiving the Fuel Allowance.</p><p>-  &euro;200 Lump Sum Payment for pensioners and people with a disability receiving the Living Alone Allowance.</p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living Lump Sum Payment to all families in receipt of the Working Family Payment.</p><p>-  Double Payment of Child Benefit to support all families with children.</p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living Payment for people receiving the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.</p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living Disability Support Grant will be paid to all people receiving a long-term Disability Payment.</p><p>In December:</p><p>-  A Christmas Bonus Double Payment will be paid to 1.3 million Social Protection recipients including Pensioners, Carer&rsquo;s and People with Disabilities.</p><p>In addition, in January 2023, the budgetary measures that will apply are: </p><p>-  The Domiciliary Care Allowance will increase by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month.</p><p>-  A &euro;12 increase in core payments with proportionate increases for qualified adults and for people who receive a reduced payment.</p><p>-  Disablement Benefit will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance.</p><p>-  Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance.</p><p>-  The earnings disregard for both the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension will be increased by &euro;25 per week, from &euro;140 to &euro;165.</p><p>-  The general Means assessment threshold for Fuel Allowance will increase from &euro;120 to &euro;200, while entitlement to the allowance will be extended to people aged over 70, subject to a means threshold of &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple. </p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance will be available in respect of children with severe illness or disability who remain in hospital for up to six months after birth.</p><p>In particular the Indecon report identified the importance of supporting the employment of disabled people.  To assist with this, in addition to the increases to the earnings disregards, Budget 2023 included a further two important measures:</p><p>-  &euro;1m in funding for enhancements to the Reasonable Accommodation Fund grants &ndash; which support the employment of disabled people in the private sector.  Following a public consultation, conducted earlier this year, the department will bring forward reform proposals before the end of the year.</p><p>-  Changes to the Jobsplus incentive scheme, to encourage private sector employers to employ disabled people.  Employers who employ people in receipt of the disability allowance or Blind pension can now avail of the grants under the scheme.</p><p>A planned review of the departments Wage Subsidy Scheme, which provides financial incentives to encourage private sector employers to employ Jobseekers with disabilities, will also commence in the coming weeks through a public consultation process.</p><p>In the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a strawman proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.  The main objectives are to simplify the system, remove anomalies, recognise the continuum of disabilities and to support employment.  The Cost of Disability research report will feed into the preparation of these reform proposals.  Work is underway by officials on the &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; with a public consultation to commence in due course.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for the scheme, and those currently in receipt of a reduced payment may now receive a higher payment.</p>  <p>  The capital disregard was also increased in June from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  This will allow carers who have accumulated savings, often to provide care for a loved one, to retain an entitlement to Carer's Allowance.</p>  <p>  Recently, as part of Budget 2023, I announced a &euro;12 increase in weekly payments from next January.

Currently, there are some 24,000 participants on the two schemes supporting long term unemployed persons back to work: Community Employment and T&uacute;s.  </p><p>We are all very conscious of the important role that CE and T&uacute;s play and we all wish to support them as best we can.  In addition to providing valuable occupational experience and training as a stepping-stone to employment for people who are unemployed, schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s also provide important and, in many cases essential, services to their local communities. </p><p>Thankfully, given the strong labour market performance the number of unemployed people dependent on social welfare payments continues to fall.  While this is very welcome it also means that the number of candidates available for CE and T&uacute;s also falls.  This creates an obvious challenge.</p><p>Having said that, it is not an insurmountable challenge, and working together with CE sponsors and T&uacute;s implementing bodies we can, and have, devised changes that will help the schemes to continue to support their local communities. </p><p>For example, following engagement with CE sponsors and T&uacute;s implementing bodies Minister Humphreys and I have announced a number of reforms and enhancements to CE and T&uacute;s since last December. </p><p>These changes included a provision to allow CE participants who reach 60 years of age to remain on CE until they reach state pension age.  We also updated the baseline year for CE which opens the scheme to a cohort of people who had previously participated in the scheme.  Extensions have also been granted to participants where the Department has not been in a position to provide new referrals to fill vacancies. Eligibility for T&uacute;s has been extended to persons in receipt of Disability Payments on a self-referral basis.</p><p>More recently as part of Budget 2023 we announced an increase of &euro;5 per week or just over 22% in the weekly CE and T&uacute;s allowance.  This increase is in addition to the increase in the core social welfare payments of &euro;12 per week, meaning the minimum payment on CE and T&uacute;s will amount to &euro;247.50 per week.  This is the lowest rate of payment and people with children or other dependents receive additional payments, which are also increasing as part of our budget measures.  For example, a person with an adult partner and one child aged over 12 will receive &euro;443.50 per week, equivalent to about &euro;23 per hour.  These are attractive rates of payment and will help to encourage participation on the schemes.</p><p>We also changed the candidate referral process for CE. Schemes have been given new flexibility to allow them to directly recruit eligible candidates to fill 30% of places but are also a mandated to accept and place at least 60% of people referred by Intreo.  This is to ensure that places do not go unfilled when there are candidates available from the Live Register.  CE sponsors and T&uacute;s implementing bodies have also been granted some flexibility to extend individual placements and to retain existing participants in cases where no replacement is immediately available.  Plans are also at an advanced stage for a new pilot scheme to extend CE eligibility to people who are Qualified Adults on a jobseeker claim; these are generally unemployed partners of people in receipt of a payment in their own right.  This will open the scheme up to approximately 30,000 additional people.  I expect this pilot to start early in 2023.</p><p>As I've already said, both Minister Humphreys and I are very conscious of the need to support CE and T&uacute;s and we continue to meet regularly with representatives of these programmes.  The changes and improvements I've just described are a direct result of these engagements and I expect that they will play a significant role in supporting the schemes in the months ahead.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This is why the Government introduced a &euro;2.4 billion package of supports in 2022 and a package of one-off measures worth &euro;2.5 billion in the Budget 2023 cost of living package.  This includes a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through which energy credits totaling &euro;600 will credited to each domestic electricity account, including Pay as You Go accounts, in November 2022, January 2023 and March 2023.</p>  <p>  In response to the on-going cost-of-living pressures, as part of Budget 2023, I secured almost &euro;2.2billion, the largest Social Protection package in the history of the state.  Some &euro;1.1billion of this package has been targeted to provide a wide range of lump-sum payments in order to help people in the coming months, in addition to a wide range of increases which will come into effect from January 2023 including:</p>  <p>  -  The Autumn Cost-of-Living Double Week Payment to most Social protection schemes which will be paid during the week commencing 17th of October 2022;</p>  <p>  -  The Double Payment of Child Benefit to support families with children will be paid alongside the regular Child Benefit Payment in November 2022;</p>  <p>  -  A &euro;400 Lump Sum Fuel Allowance Payment to all households receiving the Fuel Allowance;</p>  <p>  -  A &euro;200 Lump Sum Payment for pensioners and people with a disability receiving the Living Alone Allowance;</p>  <p>  -  A &euro;500 Lump Sum Payment to families in receipt of the Working Family Payment, Disability Allowance, Blind Pension, Invalidity Pension and the Carer's Support Grant;</p>  <p>  In addition, a 100% Christmas Bonus will be paid to all long-term social welfare recipients in December 2022.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department can make additional needs payments to help meet expenses that a person cannot pay from their weekly income.  This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary. </p>  <p>  Government has provided &euro;45.75 million for the Additional Needs Payment schemes in 2022.  A further provision of &euro;4.3 million has been provided for SWA Supplements in 2022 (excluding rent supplement).  This is a demand-led scheme and there is no budget cap.  Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p>  <p>  Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place - 0818-607080 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This is to ensure that individuals receive impartial advice and access to accurate and comprehensive information relating to social services.  This statutory independence is also to ensure that Government cannot unduly influence the information or advice offered by CIB, nor dictate how it should provide services.</p>  <p>  Similarly, each CIS company is a separate company in its own right, governed by a voluntary board of directors.  Subject to meeting service standards set by CIB these eight CIS companies are responsible for decisions on the delivery of services in their own regions. </p>  <p>  Any operational changes or decisions are therefore a matter for CIB and the independent boards.  As Minister, I cannot direct them regarding operational decisions. </p>  <p>  I absolutely recognise and value the good work carried out by volunteers, and I have been very clear to the Citizens Information Board (CIB) that it is important that the voluntary ethos of the Citizens Information Service (CIS) should be protected and the skills of its volunteers should be utilised to the maximum extent possible. </p>  <p>  CIB has also publicly acknowledged the centrality of volunteers in delivering and supporting CIB-funded services and considers their continued contribution to be vital in ensuring that Citizens Information remains an independent, trusted source of information, advice, and advocacy.</p>  <p>  In light of concerns raised recently in relation to volunteers, I met with the Chairperson and CEO of CIB seeking further information. </p>  <p>  Following our meeting, CIB has initiated an independent review of its volunteer strategy.  This independent review will consult with current and past volunteers and other important stakeholders.  It is expected that it will be concluded in the coming months and its recommendations will directly inform CIB's new three-year strategy 2023-2025.</p>  <p>  The priority for CIB is that the service provided to the public is of the highest quality and volunteers will continue to play an important role in the delivery of citizen information services. </p></reply>

It is estimated that up to additional 10,600 additional households could benefit from this measure at a cost of &euro;9.8 million.</p>  <p>  -  From January 2023, the Disablement Benefit payment will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes and a household will also no longer be debarred from receiving Fuel Allowance because a person in the household is in receipt of Disablement Benefit.

Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigations and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision-making process.  Delays can also arise if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.</p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  In this regard, my Department has had major success in clearing backlogs, notably in the disability and caring schemes.</p><p>The staffing needs of my department are also regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.</p><p>My Department is committed to ensuring that reviews of adverse decisions are carried out without delay.  Due to the increased number of applications received and decided over the last 12 months, there has been a corresponding increase in the volume of requests for reviews.  This has led to increased waiting times for reviews.  Additional resources have recently been allocated to the review areas to deal with increased volumes and to minimise delays.</p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) functions independently of my Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.  All appeals are referred to the Department in the first instance so that the original decision can be reviewed.  It is often the case that new evidence is provided with the appeal request and, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding officer.  It is important to highlight the value of providing all relevant information at the initial application stage as this will increase the likelihood of achieving a positive result earlier in the process.  If a review has not produced a favourable outcome, then a submission is prepared within the scheme area and forwarded to the SWAO without delay.</p><p>There are currently no processing delays with applications for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Invalidity Pension or Disability Allowance.<b></b>The number of applications for Additional Needs Payments increased significantly following two major advertising and communications campaigns by my Department to promote the scheme this year.  To the end of September this year, 66,000 Additional Needs Payments have been processed and paid.</p><p>In the region of 63% of applications for Additional Needs Payments are finalised within 4 weeks.  Where an application is not finalised within this timeframe, this is generally due to additional information or documentation being requested from the person to support their application.  Where my officials are aware of a customer with an urgent or an immediate need, every effort is made to ensure that customer in question receives a prompt service, usually on the same day.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Roadmap was published in January 2020 and contains seven high level goals, delivered by 66 unique commitments.  </p><p>Commitment 61 has a specific focus on food poverty: <i>develop a comprehensive programme of work to further explore the drivers of food poverty and to identify mitigating actions</i>.  In order to deliver on this commitment, I established a Food Poverty Working Group in April 2021.  The group comprises officials from a range of government departments along with representatives from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Crosscare and the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.  The membership of the group reflects the complex nature of food poverty and food insecurity. </p><p>The first key piece of work that the Working Group undertook was a mapping exercise to identify the various programmes across Government that address food poverty and provide supports in this area.  A report on the results of this exercise was published in July of this year, <i>Food poverty: Government programmes, schemes and supports</i>, and is available on my Department's website.  It found that a number of departments are engaged in programmes, schemes and supports that are connected, either directly or indirectly, to the issue of food poverty.  Expenditure in 2021 on schemes that directly addressed food poverty was &euro;89 million.</p><p>The second piece of work that the Working Group has undertaken is the development of a research proposal examining the prevalence and drivers of food poverty.  The research will identify the drivers of food poverty and examine the extent of activities addressing food poverty at a local level in two case study areas, identifying gaps and overlaps in service provision.  Research has commenced, and the final report is expected in December 2022.  It is my intention that the findings from this research will further inform the work of the Group and contribute to the production of recommendations that will assist individuals and families experiencing food poverty in Ireland.</p><p>In this context, I am pleased to have secured funding to the amount of &euro;400,000 as part of Budget 2023 to develop and implement a pilot scheme to support people experiencing food poverty.  A procurement process will be run in relation to the pilot programme next year.</p><p>In addition, within the Department, we have the School Meals programme, which includes the Hot School Meals programme introduced in 2019.  Overall funding for this has increased from &euro;38.8 million in 2015 to &euro;68.1million in 2022, reflecting the importance of the programme in providing regular, nutritious food to children enabling them to take full advantage of the education provided to them. </p><p>The Department also administers the FEAD programme (now European Social Fund Plus) in partnership with FoodCloud and the 156 community groups that distribute food packs and meals in local communities.  This programme is co-funded by the EU, supporting EU countries in the provision of material/food assistance to those who are most deprived.  During the period 2016-2020, over 774,000 individuals in Ireland were assisted by the programme, with over 990,000 food packs and more than 4.9 million meals distributed.</p></reply>

This extensive package includes measures in relation to the Working Family Payment which is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings. </p>  <p>  The Working Family Payment is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents, and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are approximately 47,000 families with 103,000 children who are currently in receipt of the payment.  The estimated expenditure on the scheme in 2022 is &euro;349 million.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the Working Family Payment a person must be engaged as an employee in full time paid employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is part of a family supported by them.  These criteria have not been changed in Budget 2023. </p>  <p>  The Budget package includes a range of measures that will assist people with the cost of living in one-off payments this Autumn.  This includes a once-off payment of &euro;500 to recipients of the Working Family Payment.  This payment will be made in November at an estimated cost of &euro;23 million.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have also provided for a &euro;40 per week increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds for all family sizes.  This is the highest ever increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds.  This will ensure that families on low incomes will receive more weekly income from the scheme - up to &euro;24 euro per week.  It will also ensure that the increase of 80 cent per hour in the National Minimum Wage does not negatively impact on people's income from the Working Family Payment.  It also means that more people will qualify for the payment.  This measure will take effect from January at a cost of approximately &euro;16.8 million in 2023.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I welcome the recent publication of the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) module on child specific deprivation.  It is critical to have accurate and detailed data if we are to better understand and address such issues.</p><p>The 2021 SILC data has shown a reduction in the overall rate of child poverty in Ireland from 7.2% in 2020 to 5.2% in 2021.  This is very welcome.  However, the recent CSO analysis shows that child-specific deprivation rates are higher for lone parent households highlighting the need for targeted measures that will assist the most vulnerable.  </p><p>I therefore welcome the recent ESRI post-budget analysis, which shows that Budget 2023 combined with one off measures to reduce the cost of living, will be effective in protecting most households from rising prices this winter.<b></b>The ESRI analysis further shows that the income of lone parents' households will remain essentially stable as a consequence of Budget 2023 measures indicating that the Government measures are, in the main, effective at protecting lone parents' households from the impact of inflation.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2023, I was pleased to announce the largest ever expansion of the Fuel Allowance Scheme.  As part of this, from January 2023, a new means test will be introduced for Over 70s.  Under the new means test, a single person over 70 can have income of &euro;500 per week and a couple can have income of &euro;1,000 per week and still qualify for Fuel Allowance.  This was a priority for me as part of Budget 2023 and is in recognition of the fact that older people are more vulnerable to the cold.</p>  <p>  Also, from January 2023, the standard means test for persons under 70 will be increased by &euro;80 from &euro;120 to &euro;200 over the maximum State Pension Contributory.  In addition, the half-rate Carer's Allowance payment and Disablement Benefit will be disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes.</p>  <p>  It is estimated these measures combined will bring an additional 81,000 households into the Fuel Allowance Scheme from January.

This replaces Local Employment Service and Job Club contracts.  All 17 of these contracts are now in place and the new service is being mobilised with the support of my Department. </p>  <p>  The new IPLAES service represents a significant increase in state investment in these services, from &euro;23 million per annum to &euro;39 million per annum, exclusive of VAT. </p>  <p>  The services focus on those furthest from the labour market and is state-wide for the first time.

This settlement resolves this long-standing issue through the payment of a once off ex-gratia payment to eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  At the end of last year, both unions involved confirmed acceptance of this settlement which will benefit approximately 2,500 people employed by CE schemes going back to 2008.  It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million. </p>  <p>  Generally, under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the wider issue as regards access to pensions for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors individual schemes, not the state are employers of CE supervisors.  Of course, CE supervisors have access to the standard State Contributory Pension.  The pension auto enrolment process will also apply to CE workers, once operational.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

I welcome the report&rsquo;s key recommendation that a form of domestic violence leave be introduced.</p><p>Once the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill is enacted, those who are suffering or at risk of domestic violence will be entitled to five days of paid leave per year.  It is recommended that the payment should be made by the employer, on a similar basis to <i>force majeure</i>leave which will protect the incomes of those using the leave.  This will ensure that Domestic Violence leave is available at short notice and without an excessive administrative burden on the person. </p><p>In addition, the Government will put in place support for employers to help them develop domestic violence workplace policies and to support employees experiencing domestic violence.</p><p>A protocol between my Department and Tusla is already in place to assist victims of domestic violence.

This extensive package includes measures in relation to the Working Family Payment.  Approximately half of the recipients of Working Family Payment are single adult households so these measures are also of benefit to lone parents.</p>  <p>  The Working Family Payment is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings.  The Working Family Payment is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents, and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  </p>  <p>  The Budget package includes a range of measures that will assist people with the cost of living in one-off payments this Autumn.  This includes a once-off payment of &euro;500 to recipients of the Working Family Payment.  A payment of &euro;500 will be made to families in receipt of Working Family Payment on the payment date regardless of the level of their Working Family Payment.  This payment will be made in November at an estimated cost of &euro;23 million.  Approximately, 44,000 families with approximately 97,000 children will receive this payment.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have also provided for a &euro;40 per week increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds for all family sizes.  This is the highest ever increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds.  This will ensure that families on low incomes will receive more weekly income from the scheme - up to &euro;24 per week.  It will also ensure that the increase of 80 cent per hour in the National Minimum Wage does not negatively impact on people's income from the Working Family Payment.</p>  <p>  This change also means that more people will qualify for the payment.  While it is difficult to model with true precision how many new families will enter the scheme, I expect this to be in the region of 1,600 families.  It should be noted that this estimate is subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients.  This measure will take effect from January at a cost of approximately &euro;16.8 million in 2023.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.</p><p>My department provides a comprehensive package of carers&rsquo; income supports including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.</p><p>The Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main scheme by which the Department provides income support to carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who require full-time care and attention.  At the end of August, there were 91,658 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2022 is approximately &euro;990 million. </p><p>The primary objective of the payment is to provide an income support to carers whose earning capacity is substantially reduced as a consequence of their caring responsibilities and in so doing to support the ongoing care of the person in respect of whom care is being provided.  </p><p>While the caring requirements of the caree(s) will be different, this does not affect the rates of the allowance, which is intended to provide an income support for the carer and does not depend on individual care requirements.  Where carers are providing care to more than one person, an increase of 50% is applicable.</p><p>Carers may also (subject to certain conditions) qualify for the:</p><p>-  Household Benefits Package</p><p>-  Free Travel Scheme</p><p>In addition to Carer's Allowance, my department provides non-means tested payment to carers, as follows:</p><p>-  The Carers Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions.  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care.  It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). At the end of August there were 3,298 recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.  Projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in 2022 is estimated at &euro;48.6 million.</p><p>-  The Carer's Support Grant is automatically paid to people in receipt of Carer's Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care allowance in June of each year.  Other carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment may also be eligible for the Grant.  The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs.  The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. As part of Budget Measures 2021, the rate of the grant was increased by &euro;150.  The new rate of &euro;1,850 came into effect from June 2021.  This is the highest rate of the grant since its introduction. On Thursday 2 June the grant was paid to some 121,000 carers and their families.  The overall cost of the grant in 2022 is expected to be over &euro;262 million.</p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  It is not means tested.  The Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is &euro;309.50 per month.  There is no restriction on the number of children for whom you may claim Domiciliary Care Allowance.  At the end of August some 48,8101 families benefited from the payment in respect of 54,558 children.  The projected expenditure on Domiciliary Care Allowance in 2022 is approximately &euro;203 million. </p><p>In Budget 2023, in acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society and the particular challenges they face in light of the current cost of living crisis, I announced a number of further financial supports for carers.  These measures benefitting family carers directly include: </p><p>-  &euro;500 Cost of Living lump sum payment to be paid in November.</p><p>-  Cost of Living Double Payment to Carers to be paid in October.</p><p>-  Carers will also receive the Christmas Bonus Double Payment in early December.</p><p>-  &euro;12 increase in the maximum rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit with effect from January 2023 with proportionate increases for people receiving a reduced rate.</p><p>-  The Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance with effect from January 2023.</p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance will increase by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month with effect from January 2023.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers by this Department under review and will ensure that consultations with carer&rsquo;s representative groups continue so that the overall objectives of the carer income support schemes provided are met.  However, any changes to the eligibility conditions to current supports or further financial supports provided by this Department would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary context.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.</p><p>The schemes are demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>In the period January to end of September 2022, payments totaling &euro;39.8 million have been made in relation to some 65,921 additional needs payments (excluding reoccurring supplements).  The main items eligible for assistance include help with fuel, utility bills, repairs to or replacement of household appliances, clothing, child related items such as cots and prams, assistance with funerals or burial costs and travel.  Support is also available to assist persons under this scheme towards rent deposits.  Some 3,400 customers are currently in receipt of an additional supplement to help with ongoing needs.  Assistance provided under these supplements includes heat, travel and other ongoing costs.  Payments totaling &euro;2.4 million have been made to date under these supplements.</p><p>The Government has provided funding of &euro;45.75 million for the provision of exceptional and urgent needs that are provided for as Additional Needs Payment in 2022.  A further provision of &euro;4.3 million has been provided for SWA Supplements in 2022 (excluding rent supplement).</p><p>The number of applications for Additional Needs Payments increased significantly in response to two major advertising and communications campaigns by my Department to promote the scheme this year.  Table 1 shows the number of additional needs payments (excluding reoccurring supplements) paid from January &ndash; September 2022 and during the same period in 2021.</p><p>The Community Welfare Service is committed to providing a quality service to all citizens, ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  My Department continues to work to improve the service to citizens and every effort is being made to minimise processing times.</p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work. </p>  <p>  In March 2020, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Regulations made under the emergency legislation providing for the Enhanced Illness Benefit in respect of Covid-19 contained a sunset clause, that is, that the scheme would no longer be in effect after a specified date.  An extension to these special arrangements required consultation with the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  This date was extended a number of times; the latest extension expired on 30 September 2022.</p>  <p>  Much has changed since the provisions were introduced in March 2020, in particular the development of a range of vaccines; the subsequent successful roll-out of the vaccination programme and later the booster programme; and the phased ending of restrictions from 22 January 2022.  The Department of Health was consulted and advised that, in line with the transition out of the emergency phase of the pandemic, the proposal to provide Illness Benefit for Covid-19 in a manner similar to that of any other infectious disease was now an appropriate one.  On that basis I have no plans to reintroduce the payment.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.       </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are approximately 4,500 claims in payment at present.  Government has provided &euro;53.9 million for the scheme for 2022. </p>  <p>  Further to commitments in the Programme for Government and the Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, my Department reviewed the means assessment disregards for Farm Assist.  The report is available on the Government's website.  One of the key recommendations of the report was to expand the list of agri-environmental schemes that attract a disregard for Farm Assist.  I introduced this measure effective from June 2022. </p>  <p>  In the Farm Assist means test, income from these schemes currently attracts a disregard of &euro;2,540, with 50% of the balance assessed as means.  I was pleased to announce in Budget 2023 that, from January, the amount of income from agri-environmental schemes that is disregarded will increase to &euro;5,000. </p>  <p>  The Review of the Farm Assist disregards also recommended that my Department would work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to identify schemes in Ireland's upcoming Common Agricultural Policy Strategic Plan 2023-2027 which may be considered for inclusion in the list of schemes which attract this disregard.  I am committed to this and will consider any additional schemes in that context. </p>  <p>  The other recommendations in the report, which include increases in the capital disregard and income disregarded from off-farm earnings, would have to be considered as part of the budgetary process. </p>  <p>  I have also agreed to carry out a review of how income from land leased out by farmers is treated in the means assessments for the State Non-Contributory Pension and Farm Assist.

This is the largest Social Protection Budget Day Package in the history of the State. </p><p>In order to ease the pressure and stress that many households are facing, I am bringing forward a series of exceptional lump sum payments to support people.  These include:A Cost of Living Double Payment in October to all social protection recipients including Pensioners, Carers &amp;amp; People with Disabilities. </p><p>- A &euro;400 lump sum payment to all households in receipt of Fuel Allowance, many of whom are pensioners, to be paid in November.</p><p>- An additional &euro;200 Lump Sum Payment to all persons, many of whom are pensioners, in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance which will also be paid in November. </p><p>- In December, the Christmas Bonus Double Payment will be paid to all Pensioners, Carers, Persons with Disabilities, One Parent Family Payment and other Social Protection recipients.</p><p>As we turn to 2023, I announced a &euro;12 euro increase in weekly rates of payment for pensioners and people of working age to take effect from January 2023.  This measure alone will cost almost &euro;900 million euro. It is the largest budget increase in weekly payments since the mid-2000s.</p><p>I was very aware, when addressing my Budget priorities for 2023, that many families and older people fall just outside the qualifying criteria for Fuel Allowance and that this payment does not reach everybody.  So, in Budget 2023, we focused on expanding the scheme to reach more households.  </p><p>One of the reforms to the Fuel Allowance Scheme is that, from January 2023, a new means threshold will be introduced for people aged 70 years and over.  The new means threshold will be &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple.  This is a significant expansion of the means threshold for those aged 70 or over.</p><p>As part of this measure, those aged over 70 no longer have to be in receipt of a qualifying Social Welfare payment to access the Fuel Allowance payment.  However, to qualify for the Fuel Allowance, they will still have to satisfy all other relevant qualifying criteria.</p><p>This reform seeks to ensure that older people not currently in receipt of Fuel Allowance, but who are marginally outside the thresholds, will now be covered by the scheme.  This reform is being made as older people can often be more vulnerable to the effects of energy poverty. </p><p>It is expected that up to 64,000 new households may qualify for Fuel Allowance as a result of this measure alone.</p><p>Other measures announced by Government in Budget 2023 - such as three energy credits worth &euro;600 in total - will also assist pensioners.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Recipients of state pension non-contributory are obliged, throughout the lifetime of their claim, to notify the Department of any changes in their circumstances that may affect their pension entitlement.  A list of the reportable changes of circumstance is included in the initial notification of pension award and in all subsequent review communications issued.  </p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation provides that the personal representative of a deceased person who, at any time received a means-tested payment, is obliged to give notice to the Department of their intention to distribute the deceased's estate and to provide a schedule of the assets of the estate.

The programme aims to improve a person&rsquo;s opportunities to return to the labour market. </p>  <p>  Generally CE placements, for those up to aged 60, are intended to be temporary and subject to time limits.  This is to ensure the continued availability of places on CE schemes for more recent long-term unemployed candidates.  Those who are unemployed and in receipt of an eligible payment for 12 months or more may be eligible to participate on CE. </p>  <p>  In general, all CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  However, CE participants, working towards a major educational award, can seek to extend participation by up to a further two years to enable them to reach the required qualification standards. </p>  <p>  Those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for up to three years, while CE participants who are aged over 55 and who commenced on CE prior to the introduction of the changes in 2017 continue to be eligible to stay on CE for six consecutive years.  CE participants over the age of 60 can participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age.  </p>  <p>  During the COVID pandemic Minister Humphreys and I extended CE participants' contracts on a number of occasions in order to support schemes, given the impact of public health restrictions on schemes, the services they provide and on participants.    </p>  <p>  Given the post COVID difficulties many schemes face in recruiting new candidates to replace the increased numbers of participants leaving CE, participants including those with extended contracts, may not be required to leave CE, where a suitable replacement has not been referred to the scheme. This is to ensure services provided to communities by schemes continue to be supported.  Any extension under this provision must be approved by officials from the Department and consideration will be given to the any remaining impact of COVID on the turnover and recruitment of participants, services provided by schemes, along with recruitment and referral efforts.  Approximately 900 participants have had their contracts extended on this basis since the start of April. </p>  <p>  It remains important that CE places are available for persons who are long term unemployed to assist them return to employment in the labour market.  Therefore, extensions are only approved in specific circumstances where an extension will not prevent a more recent long term unemployed person the opportunity to take up a CE opportunity to avail of work experience and training.  For similar reasons, it is not proposed to change the rules applying to participants over age 50. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants in particular, given the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.</p></reply>

This group comprises of relevant departments, agencies, a Disability Stakeholder Group and people with disabilities.  The group considers and monitors recommended actions required by the various Government Departments on foot of the report.</p><p>A number of the measures I introduced as part of Budget 2023 in support of people with disabilities and carers, reflect some of the findings of the report and will go towards alleviating some of the costs experienced.  These measures include:</p><p>- A Cost of Living Double Payment will be paid to Social Protection recipients including all Pensioners, Carers and people on Disability Payments in October.</p><p>In November the following payments will be made:</p><p>- &euro;500 Cost of Living Disability Support Grant will be paid to all people receiving a long-term Disability Payment.</p><p>- &euro;500 Cost of Living Payment for people receiving the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.</p><p>- &euro;400 Lump Sum Fuel Allowance Payment to all households receiving the Fuel Allowance.</p><p>- &euro;200 Lump Sum Payment for pensioners and people with a disability receiving the Living Alone Allowance.</p><p>- &euro;500 Cost of Living Lump Sum Payment to all families in receipt of the Working Family Payment.</p><p>- Double Payment of Child Benefit to support all families with children.</p><p>In addition:</p><p>- A Christmas Bonus Double Payment will be paid to 1.3 million Social Protection </p> <blockquote> 	  	recipients including Pensioners, Carer&rsquo;s and People with Disabilities in December.  </blockquote>  <p>In January 2023, the following measures will be implemented:</p><p>- 12 increase in weekly payments with proportionate increases for qualified adults and for people who receive a reduced rate. </p><p>- The earnings disregard for both the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension will be increased by &euro;25 per week, from &euro;140 to &euro;165.</p><p>- Means assessment threshold for Fuel Allowance will increase from &euro;120 to &euro;200.</p><p>- Disablement Benefit will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance.</p><p>- Domiciliary Care Allowance will increase by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month.</p><p>- Domiciliary Care Allowance will be available in respect of children with severe illness or disability who remain in hospital for up to six months after birth.</p><p>- Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance.</p><p>The Indecon report noted in particular the importance of supporting the employment of disabled people.  To assist with this, in addition to the increases to the earning disregards, Budget 2023 included two other important measures:</p><p>- &euro;1m funding for enhancements to the Reasonable Accommodation Fund grants.  These grants support the employment of disabled people in the private sector.  Following a public consultation, conducted earlier this year, the department will bring forward reform proposals before the end of the year.</p><p>- Changes to the Jobs plus incentive scheme, to encourage private sector employers in employ disabled people.  Employers who employ people in receipt of the disability allowance or Blind pension can now benefit from the scheme.</p><p>A planned review of the departments Wage Subsidy Scheme, which provides financial incentives to encourage private sector employers to employ Jobseekers with disabilities, will also commence in the coming weeks, through a public consultation process.</p><p>In the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a strawman proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.  The main objectives are to simplify the system, remove anomalies, recognise the continuum of disabilities and to support employment.  The Cost of Disability research report will feed into the preparation of these reform proposals.  Work is underway by officials on the &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; with a public consultation to commence in due course.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The four grants are: the Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Personal Reader Grant, the Employee Retention Grant and the Job Interview Interpreter Grant.

Recruitment and retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to pay and conditions. </p><p>As the State does not employ early years educators or school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector.  However, there has recently been an important and historic development with the setting of new minimum hourly rates for various roles in the sector.</p><p>On 15 September, the first ever Employment Regulation Orders for Early Years Services came into effect, setting new minimum hourly rates of pay.</p><p>It is estimated that 73% of those working in the sector will see their wages rise as a result.</p><p>The Orders are being supported by Core Funding&ndash; which has an allocation of &euro;259 million in its first year &ndash; to support improvements in staff wages, alongside a commitment to freeze parental fees and sustainability of services.</p><p>As announced in Budget 2023, the Core Funding allocation will increase by &euro;28 million for year 2 and already I have signalled that &euro;4 million of that allocation will support the removal of 3-year experience rule for graduate premiums &ndash; with the allocation of the remaining &euro;24 million to be informed by the emerging data from Year 1 of operation.</p><p>I am also committed to addressing other challenges which may impact on the recruitment and retention of staff in the sector.</p><p>In December 2021, I published &quot;Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028&quot;. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in the sector.

One of the key goals underpinning my Department&rsquo;s work is to help young people achieve their potential.</p><p>In regards to the delivery of youth services and supports, my officials and I have a very good working relationship with the National Youth Organisations, including the organisation that conducted the survey, the National Youth Council of Ireland.</p><p>As the Deputy will know, in recognition of the vital role played by youth work in providing support to young people, funding for youth services and programmes increased further in Budget 2023. The current funding has risen from &euro;61.789 million in 2020 to &euro;72.948 million, an increase of 18% increase overall.</p><p>The funding supports the delivery of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth work sector. The majority is distributed through the targeted UBU Your Place Your Space scheme.  UBU serves to improve the seven personal and social developmental outcomes. These are:</p><p>1.Emotional Intelligence</p><p>2.Communication Skills</p><p>3.Confidence</p><p>4.Planning and Problem Solving</p><p>5.Creativity and Imagination</p><p>6.Relationships, and</p><p>7.Resilience and Determination </p><p>There is strong evidence showing that building social and emotional capabilities such as these can have greater long-term impact than focussing on reducing the &quot;symptoms&quot; of poor outcomes for young people.</p><p>The Education and Training Boards advised that over 80,000 young people benefited from UBU Your Place Your Space in 2021. Also, over 70,000 young people benefit from youth clubs supported through the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme in a typical year.</p><p>Young people were severely affected by the restrictions to protect public health during the pandemic. In recognition of the tremendous support provided by the youth sector to young people, funding levels were maintained in full.  An additional &euro;1.7 million in minor grant schemes was made available in 2020 and in 2021 to address Covid-19 related costs. Services that were active operated in line with public health guidance.</p><p>It must be emphasised, however, that a whole of Government approach is ensuring that Ireland remains an attractive location and continues to have a lot to offer for its young people. I support the work of my fellow cabinet members with responsibility for priority areas in young people's lives including education, arts, sport, health, housing, employment, and social protection.</p></reply>

While only in operation since then, Core Funding has already achieved significant success. 91% of services are in contract for Core Funding.</p>  <p>  This means that a fee freeze now applies to the overwhelming majority of families using early learning and childcare services. It also means the ECCE Programme and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are being offered to all eligible families in these services.</p>  <p>  This is particularly important in the context of rising prices for goods and services across the economy and in light of the significant additional investment that I secured for the NCS in Budget 2023. Core Funding has also supported the agreement of historic Employment Regulation Orders leading to wage increases for the large majority of staff in the sector.</p>  <p>  There is also evidence of increased capacity in the sector, with initial analysis showing that increased child places funded through Core Funding are the type of capacity that is in highest demand relative to supply, particularly more baby and toddler places, as well as school-age places. The geographical breakdown across the country also indicates expansion in urban and commuter areas where there has been significant pressure on places.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2023, I secured an additional &euro;52 million to meet the cost of this increase in capacity in Year 1 of the Scheme. I also secured an additional &euro;28 million to increase the Core Funding allocation to &euro;287 million for Year 2 of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  Already I have committed &euro;4 million of that additional allocation bring further improvements to workforce pay and conditions (through the removal of 3-year experience rule for graduate premium) with the remaining &euro;24 million to introduce other developments to the Scheme &ndash; that will continue to focus on meeting the combined objectives of Core Funding - improved quality for children, including through pay and conditions for staff in the sector, improved affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.</p></reply>

The Government will assess the report and its recommendations once reviewed.  I can assure you that the health and wellbeing of all people who avail of accommodation provided by the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) is of the highest priority.</p><p>As you will know, my Department is  currently providing accommodation to over 57,000 people - approximately 41,000 displaced Ukrainians and over 16,000 international protection applicants. At this point in 2021, the figure was approximately 7,250.</p><p>The availability of accommodation to house international protection applicants remains a very significant challenge. My Department is actively engaged in the sourcing of emergency accommodation to ensure that we can continue to meet our international obligations to those seeking refuge in Ireland. My officials continue to seek accommodation solutions to the increasing numbers of international protection arrivals.</p><p>Last week, as part of the 2022 tender process for IPAS own-door accommodation, my Department opened the Finn Accommodation Centre in Ballybofey, Donegal. This facility has over 45 high quality apartments that have been recently renovated. The capacity is 179 people. These apartments has been made available to families seeking international protection in Ireland. The first families have already moved to the centre.</p><p>Added to this, 10 new contracts/properties have been identified, subject to contract, which are expected to result in additional bed spaces. This tender was re-advertised on 6 October 2022 with a response deadline of 8 November 2022 in a further effort to increase capacity in the system.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the Programme for Government, a commitment was made to deliver a new model of accommodation and supports for International Protection applicants. As part of this process I published <i>A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service</i>in February 2021.</p><p>In the nineteen months since its publication, my Department has made considerable progress in delivering these reforms, including:</p><p>- recruitment of a team dedicated to drive the implementation of the new programme, </p><p>- establishment of governance structures to oversee transition to the new model - a Programme Board and an External Advisory Committee, </p><p>- development of an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo;,</p><p>- advancement of our Communication Strategy, including a dedicated webpage where members of the Public can find updates on the progress being made, and,</p><p>- initiation of a planning process for Phase One Reception and Integration Centres. </p><p>A new integration fund, offering grants to civil society organisations for projects supporting the integration of international protection applicants, was also launched in August.  The fund will be awarded shortly.</p><p>I have secured 22m euro in Budget 2023, an increase of 41% on this year's allocation, to move ahead with key reforms envisaged in the White Paper.  The increased budget will be focused in particular on enhancing the supports provided to international protection applicants.  </p><p>I envisage an expanded role for NGOs in the delivery of such supports, particularly to vulnerable applicants.</p></reply>

The enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 will allow for the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p><p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) is a very important piece of legislation that changes the existing law on capacity from the status approach of the wardship system to a flexible functional approach, whereby capacity is assessed on an issue and time-specific basis.  </p><p>It will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  Adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements on a phased basis over 3 years from the date of commencement.</p><p>Amendments are required so that full commencement of the 2015 Act can take place. The amendments will streamline processes, in the interests of those using its provisions.  They will also strengthen the safeguards included in the 2015 Act. A number of measures in the Bill will also give further effect to the state&rsquo;s ratification of the UNCRPD.</p><p>The Amendment Bill is currently progressing through the Seanad, having cleared all D&aacute;il Stages. It is intended to have the Bill enacted, and the 2015 Act commenced, at the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p>Once the amended Act is commenced, the Decision Support Service (DSS) will become fully operational. The DSS is the organisation that will operate the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act and will respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties. To date, the Decision Support Service has made considerable progress in putting in place the administrative and IT systems needed to operate the 2015 Act. These preparations have been supported by an Inter-Departmental Steering Group. </p><p>&euro;8.3 million was secured for the DSS in 2023. This represents the third consecutive budgetary increase for the DSS and reflects government&rsquo;s commitment to the abolition of wardship and the replacement of that system with the appropriate suite of rights based decision supports.</p></reply>

With the current minimum hourly NCS subsidy set at &euro;0.50 per hour, the represents an additional &euro;0.90 per hour off the cost of early learning and childcare. This translates to up to &euro;63.00 off families weekly bill for early learning and childcare per child. With up to &euro;22.50 currently available per week, this represents up to an additional &euro;40.50 off weekly costs.</p><p>From 2nd of January 2023, any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy under NCS (see Table) will see an increase in their subsidy. For those who receive a subsidy based on an income assessed subsidy, the amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy rate. The amount of increase individual families will see in their per hour subsidy, will differ widely depending on their current subsidy.</p><p><b>Table 1: Maximum Income Assessed Subsidy</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Child&rsquo;s age</th>       <th>Per Hour</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>24 weeks to 12 months</td>       <td>&euro;5.10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 to 35 months</td>       <td>&euro;4.35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years or older and not yet in school</td>       <td>&euro;3.95</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>School age (or 6 years to 15 years)</td>       <td>&euro;3.75</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition, on 15th September, I launched Together for Better, the new funding model for early learning and childcare. This new funding model will support delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.</p><p>Together for Better brings together three major elements, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), the NCS and Core Funding.</p><p>Core Funding is the new funding stream in operation since 15 September 2022.  A central condition of Core Funding is that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This gives parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensures that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time.</p><p>Participation in the Core Funding is optional and a list of participating services is available online here: . To date, more than 91% of services are signed-up and thereby agreeing to operating the fee conditions. Parents should also be receiving a copy of their Partner Services fees policy outlined in the Parent Statement. I would encourage parents to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee for support and guidance. Contact information for City/County Childcare Committee is available here: </p></reply>

Approximately 89% of children in care are currently being cared for by foster carers, enabling them to live in a safe, secure, and stable home environment.  </p>  <p>  Foster carers are paid at a rate of &euro;325 per week for a child under 12, and &euro;352 per week for a child over 12 and under 18.  In certain circumstances, where the necessary criteria are met, enhanced and additional payments may be made.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the fact that the basic rates of the foster care payment have not been increased since 2009, and I am acutely aware of the disappointment of foster carers that no increase was granted in the recent budget.  Myself and the CEO of Tusla met in the aftermath of the budget, and discussed the issues of supports to foster carers.  I recognise that foster carers, like many others, are experiencing cost of living pressures and both myself and Tusla want to respond to this in a positive and meaningful way.Following this engagement it has been agreed that a single additional once-off cost of living payment is to be paid in respect of each child in foster care. The payment is to be made at the current foster care allowance rate of &euro;325 for a child under 12 and &euro;352 for a child over 12 and under 18 years.  It is the intention of Tusla and my Department that the payment should issue before the end of 2022, to all applicable cohorts of foster carers, including foster carers working with private providers. </p>  <p>   I hope that this once off payment will go some way to alleviating the financial pressures foster carers are currently facing. I will continue to engage with Tusla in the coming months to improve the supports available to foster carers, and I will make every effort in future budgets to address the issue of an increase to the rates of the foster care allowance. </p>  <p>  Separately the Tusla Board has on Friday 30th September 2022 considered a major improvement plan for foster care covering a wide range of issues. I am committed to working with Tusla on the issues raised in that review and in the consultations, including with foster carers, that contributed to its development.</p></reply>

A new funding model was to be the key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State. Further to Budget 2023 announcements, that achievement will be reached in 2023, five years ahead of schedule, with commitment to spend over &euro;1 billion on early learning and childcare. This significant investment will be delivered through Together for Better, the new funding model which is now in place. The table below sets out the steady increase in investment over the past number of years.</p><p>A large portion of the new investment will be channeled through a new funding scheme, Core Funding, worth &euro;266 million in 2023 and through significant developments to the National Childcare Scheme which will be worth &euro;358 million in 2023, along with investment of &euro;308 million in the Early Childhood Care and Education programme including the Access and Inclusion Model.</p><p>The UNICEF-recommended investment level in ELC and SAC is 1% of GDP while the OECD average is 0.9% of GDP. </p><p>It is important to note that Irish GDP is seen as an extremely poor point of international comparison. A more appropriate comparator for the Irish context recommended by the Economic Statistics Review Group is modified GNI. (GNI*).

The enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 will allow for the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p><p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) is a very important piece of legislation that changes the existing law on capacity from the status approach of the wardship system to a flexible functional approach, whereby capacity is assessed on an issue and time-specific basis.  </p><p>It will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.

The Decision Support Service (DSS) will operate the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act and will respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties. </p><p>During the preparation of the General Scheme of the Bill careful attention was given to discourse and commentary on the 2015 Act, which has stretching back to the passage of that Act, and for which significant consultations were undertaken. In that regard it should be noted that the Amendment Bill is primarily by way of procedural improvement to the 2015 Act, in the main it does not represent significant policy change from the 2015 Act itself.</p><p>It should be also be noted that a consultation process took place at the beginning of the year on the codes of practice that will accompany the commencement of the Act, and that regular engagement between the Department and disability groups has take place in various fora.  </p><p>Whilst not a full consultation, updates and discussions on the progress of the legislation have taken place on a regular basis with members of the Disability Stakeholder Group (DSG) at my Department's Disability Consultative Committee (DCC) meetings and the full meetings of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group (NDISSG). Most recently, the legislation was discussed at my Department's DCC on 20th September and an update was provided at the NDISSG on 4th October. The DSG is a voluntary group that oversees implementation of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and provides input to wider government disability policy. It is comprised of individuals and groups with experience of disability issues, whether lived experience, professional or academic expertise, advocacy or civil society experience, or as representatives of disabled person's organisations (DPOs).  </p><p>A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, has overseen the preparations for commencement of the Act and these officials have also engaged with various bodies in relation to Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, many of whom have run their own engagement and consultation processes around the Act over the period of time since development of the 2015 Act. </p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007.</p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD. As the Deputy will be aware, the Optional Protocol is an international treaty that establishes procedures aimed at strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the Convention. </p>  <p>  Ratification of the Optional Protocol is a commitment in the Programme for Government, and it was always the intention of Government to ratify once the State's first periodic review before the UN Committee had concluded. Ireland submitted its first State Report to the UN Committee in November 2021, and we had anticipated the review to conclude this year. However, due to delays at UN level, I understand that Ireland&rsquo;s appearance before the Committee will now be delayed, possibly for some time. </p>  <p>  In light of this, both Minister O' Gorman and I have indicated that we are open to earlier ratification.</p>  <p>  Ratification, when it occurs, will be contingent on the State being in a position to meet its obligations thereunder. This is reflective of the State&rsquo;s longstanding approach to entering into binding international obligations in good faith, and at a point where the State is in a position to meet its obligations.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to determine in full the requirements for ratification to occur at the earliest possible date. One key action required for ratification is the full commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. This Act is a key requirement for compliance with a number of measures related to the UNCRPD. Amending legislation is required to commence the Act in full and this is before the Houses at the moment. The Assisted Decision-making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 has cleared all D&aacute;il Stages and completed Committee Stage in the Seanad on 6 October.</p>  <p>  Alongside this work, my Department has engaged with internal legal advisors, and on an initial basis with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Foreign Affairs, to assist in scoping any further domestic requirements for ratification. Should any such requirements be identified, they will be addressed as a matter of priority.</p></reply>

This is why I went to some lengths to secure the audio recordings when originally they were believed to have been deleted.  </p>  <p>  Many of the witnesses who described their personal experiences to the Confidential Committee did so in the legitimate expectation that their confidentiality would be protected after the dissolution of the Commission. I know the anger and frustration many survivors felt when they saw their testimonies abbreviated, or condensed with the testimonies of others. They wanted their own words to stand as part of the historical record. This is what I want to achieve too. </p>  <p>  I believe that a process with the capacity to record, preserve and recognise survivors&rsquo; personal accounts, presents the most meaningful opportunity to address the concerns expressed to me. Such a process can restore choice and agency to survivors. The accounts will be housed in the National Centre for Research and Remembrance. This rightly places the lived experience of survivors at the heart of our National Archives in a visible and powerful way.  </p>  <p>  This new initiative will focus on respectful recording and acknowledgement of the lived experiences of those who spent time in institutions.  The process will have a statutory basis and operate with the consent of participants. Those who recounted their experiences to the Confidential Committee will have the option of permitting the reuse of this testimony and/or offering new or additional oral or written testimony. Importantly, the process will be underpinned by human rights principles and overseen by a team with expertise in human rights, trauma and memory, communications and oral history.  </p>  <p>  In advancing our deliberations we are consulting with relevant legal and technical experts to develop the initiative in the context of work on the National Centre for Research and Remembrance. Most importantly, we will also consult survivors on their views. This initiative demonstrates the State&rsquo;s willingness to hear and formally acknowledge the deeply personal accounts of survivors.  I will bring specific proposals on the initiative to Government for approval by the end of the year.</p></reply>

Progress made include: the recruitment of a team dedicated to driving the implementation of the new programme; the establishment of Governance structures to oversee transition to the new model in the form of a Programme Board and an External Advisory Committee; the development of the community accommodation model including the acquisition of properties; the development of an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo; as set out in the White Paper; the advancement of our Communication Strategy to include a dedicated webpage where all members of the Public can find updates on the progress being made; and the initiation of a planning process for Phase One Reception and Integration Centres. A new integration fund, offering grants to civil society organisations for projects supporting the integration of International Protection Applicants, was also launched in August.  The awards will be announced shortly.</p><p>As will be appreciated, the war in Ukraine has had an unavoidable impact on timelines for the implementation of the White Paper, as staff in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have been temporarily diverted to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations including members of the White paper Transition Team. Upwards of 46,000 people displaced by the war in Ukraine have come to Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive, and over 36,000 have been accommodated by the State.  Alongside this, there has been a substantial increase in the number of people seeking international protection with over 10,000 arrivals in the first three quarters of 2022 alone. Overall my Department is now accommodating over 50,000 people, compared with 7,000 at this time last year. The Department is working diligently to manage the response to the Ukraine crisis whilst continuing to progress the aims of the White Paper. </p><p>In this vastly changed context, an overall review of the projected timelines and deliverables in the White Paper is currently underway. This is a complex exercise that will take account of both the delays that have arisen as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and the impact of the substantial increase in numbers seeking International Protection. </p><p>The planning assumptions underpinning the White Paper is based on average projected arrivals of 3,500 International Protection applicants per year. This review is reassessing these projections and how this impacts on key deliverables.  The review is also considering whether it is preferable to prioritise the implementation of certain aspects of the White Paper reforms over others. The objective of such an approach would be to progress with key reforms that are achievable in the current altered context. This could enable progress on a meaningful reform programme that adheres to the key principles of the White Paper.  The review will also focus on identifying new approaches that will help the system to manage with the uncertainty and its demand led nature and address future needs.</p><p>An initial paper with some options and recommendations has been brought to the White Paper Programme Board for their input and feedback. </p><p>Notwithstanding the impact of the Ukraine crisis, the implementation of the new model is and will continue to be a key priority for the Department.</p></reply>

This figure will likely be higher by the end of October.  </p><p>The books included were selected by an appropriate committee of experienced librarians, and books and bags have been procured by the LGMA. Insert resources have been prepared by invited partners to be supplemented at county level including information for parents on transitions to primary school from NEPs. The feedback from parents on the books and resources is so far very positive.</p><p>The bags are still available in English and Irish and families can select which language bag they would like.</p><p>Extra flexibility was offered to Ukrainian families where the book bag is available to all children newly arrived in Ireland starting primary school. </p><p>An evaluation of the initiative is currently underway.

I will assume responsibility for financial governance and performance oversight of the HSE&rsquo;s disabilities budget, once the transfer is completed. My priority is to ensure that the transfer happens in a seamless and efficient way so that services are maintained and enhanced and that all necessary and appropriate governance and financial oversight arrangements are in place.</p>  <p>  The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022 was signed by the President on the 12th of April 2022 and provides the overarching legislative framework for the transfer. In developing the legislation, and since then, there has been intensive engagement between DCEDIY and the DoH to date, to facilitate the transfer of functions. </p>  <p>  The relevant Departments, in consultation with DPER, and working with the HSE, are finalising financial governance arrangements and addressing all outstanding policy matters, with the expectation of bringing a memo to Government in the shortest timeframe possible, to facilitate the transfer.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to plan for the Transfer of Functions with significant knowledge transfer on-going, particularly in recent weeks with an emphasis on the estimates process and the development of the HSE National Service Plan. The Department is also putting in place the appropriate organisational structures and resources to enable a smooth and efficient progression of all matters once the Transfer takes place. </p></reply>

On 15th September, I launched Together for Better, the new funding model for early learning and childcare. This new funding model will support delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.</p><p>Together for Better brings together three major programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model, the National Childcare Scheme and the new Core Funding scheme.</p><p>I am delighted that to date, 91% - well over 4,000 &ndash; early learning and childcare providers have signed up to Core Funding. This is a tremendous level of uptake and will make a positive impact for parents and children using these services through investment in quality and in affordability with more funding for staff and a commitment not to increase fees. </p><p>Core Funding has a budget of &euro;259 million in full year costs for year 1 of the programme (September 2022-August 2023) to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. </p><p>The majority of Core Funding is distributed based on a service's capacity - the opening hours, opening weeks and the age group of children for whom services are provided as well as number of places available. This includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions, for administrative staff/time, and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs. Contact and non-contact time, holiday pay, sick pay and other employer costs, are all factored in to the staff costs allocation in Core Funding.</p><p>In addition, further funding is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme. The Graduate Lead Educator Premium in Core Funding is paid as a top up on the number of hours of provision that is led by a graduate. The Graduate Manager Premium is paid as a top up on the number of hours of operation of a service whose manager is a graduate.</p><p>Core Funding allows for substantial increases in the total cost base for the sector, related both to pay and non-pay costs, without additional costs being passed on to parents. </p><p>Participation in Core Funding means that fees cannot increase above September 2021 levels for Partner Services. Core Funding also requires Partner Services to offer the NCS and/or ECCE to all eligible parents to ensure that parents can avail of their full entitlement to subsidised provision. The combination of the fee freeze plus access to increased subsidies ensures improved affordability for parents which is particularly important in the context of rising prices for goods and services across the economy.</p><p>The introduction of fee management is one of the recommendations of the Expert Group in their report, <i>Partnership for the Public Good</i>. The fee freeze for the first year is the first step in this few management process and will be further developed in future years as more information about income and costs in the sector is analysed.</p><p>Core Funding has also supported the agreement of historic Employment Regulation Orders leading to wage increases for the large majority of staff in the sector.</p><p>There is also evidence of increased capacity in the sector, with initial analysis showing that increased child places funded through Core Funding are the type of capacity that is in highest demand relative to supply, particularly more baby and toddler place hours, as well as school-age place hours. The geographical breakdown across the country also indicates expansion in urban and commuter areas where there has been significant pressure on places.</p><p>In Budget 2023, I secured an additional &euro;52 million to meet the cost of this increase in capacity in Year 1 of the Scheme. I also secured an additional &euro;28 million to increase the Core Funding allocation to &euro;287 million for Year 2 of the Scheme.</p><p>I have committed &euro;4 million of that additional allocation in Year 2 to remove the 3-year experience rule for graduate premiums (subject to amendment to the ERO) with the remaining &euro;24 million to introduce other developments to the Scheme &ndash; that will continue to focus on meeting the combined objectives of Core Funding - improved quality for children, including through pay and conditions for staff in the sector, improved affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.</p><p>Further interrogation of the new Core Funding application data is required in order to most effectively design developments in Year 2 of the scheme. </p><p>Together for Better aims to transform the sector and I am committed to working with Partner Services delivering early learning and childcare for the public good.</p></reply>

However, my Department organises a NGO Stakeholder Engagement Forum on Ukraine every three weeks where Departments brief key NGOs on their Ukraine response. This Forum provides an opportunity for NGOs to raise concerns that have been brought to them by BOTPs.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has been engaging with the Community Forum and local organisations at local authority level, bringing in statutory services, such as Tusla and the HSE, and using those fora to link services to centres in the particular local authority area. My Department continues to engage proactively with the Local Community Forum in seeking to continue the cooperation and collaboration that has taken place to date.</p></reply>

I carefully considered the issues raised by them in the development of the Institutional Burials Act 2022. </p>  <p>  The Act, which was signed into law in July 2022, provides the underlying legislative basis for an intervention, whereby the remains of those who died in residential institutions in respect of which a public body has or had a relevant role, and who were buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner, may be recovered and re-interred in a respectful and appropriate way. It also provides for the identification of remains and their return to family members, where possible.</p>  <p>  On 4 October, the Government made an Order under the Act to establish an independent Office to lead an intervention at the Tuam site. The making of the Order follows on from Resolutions in the D&aacute;il and Seanad last month approving the draft Order that was agreed by Government in July. Progress at the various stages has been communicated to survivors and any other stakeholders who have expressed an interest in receiving updates on these issues from my Department through our dedicated mailing list.</p>  <p>  Arrangements for recruitment of a Director to head up the Tuam Office are currently being finalised and my officials are liaising with the Public Appointments Service in this regard. Preparations are also underway for the appointment of an Advisory Board to provide advice and guidance to the Director. The legislation provides that the Board will consist of six members and will include a former resident and a family member of the deceased. The Director will be required to consult with the Board at regular intervals, including at key decision points in an intervention. </p>  <p>  In addition, in line with the provisions of the Act, the Director will be required to provide regular updates on the intervention to family members, stakeholders and the public.  </p></reply>

Although this was envisaged as a way to allow the truth as survivors wanted it told to emerge, I am mindful that this has not happened for many. I have always recognised the importance of these testimonies. This is why I went to some lengths to secure the audio recordings when originally they were believed to have been deleted.  </p>  <p>  Many of the witnesses who described their personal experiences to the Confidential Committee did so in the legitimate expectation that their confidentiality would be protected after the dissolution of the Commission. I know the anger and frustration many survivors felt when they saw their testimonies abbreviated, or condensed with the testimonies of others. They wanted their own words to stand as part of the historical record. This is what I want to achieve too.</p>  <p>  I believe that a new process with the capacity to record, preserve and recognise survivors&rsquo; personal accounts, presents the most meaningful opportunity to address the concerns expressed to me. Such a process can restore choice and agency to survivors. The accounts will be housed in the National Centre for Research and Remembrance. This rightly places the lived experience of survivors at the heart of our National Archives in a visible and powerful way.  </p>  <p>  This new initiative will focus on respectful recording and acknowledgement of the lived experiences of those who spent time in institutions.  The process will have a statutory basis and operate with the consent of participants. Those who recounted their experiences to the Confidential Committee will have the option of permitting the reuse of this testimony and/or offering new or additional oral or written testimony. Importantly, the process will be underpinned by human rights principles and overseen by a team with expertise in human rights, trauma and memory, communications and oral history.  </p>  <p>  In advancing our deliberations we are consulting with relevant legal and technical experts to develop the initiative in the context of work on the National Centre for Research and Remembrance. Most importantly, we will also consult survivors on their views. This initiative demonstrates the State&rsquo;s willingness to hear and formally acknowledge the deeply personal accounts of survivors. I will bring specific proposals on the initiative to Government for approval by the end of the year.</p></reply>

It currently comprises 25 members, representing a range of perspectives within the disability community, and includes an independent Chairperson. The current members were appointed for a three year term beginning in January 2022.</p><p>The DSG has an important role in independently monitoring the implementation of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), which is the key framework for policy and action to address the rights of persons with disabilities in Ireland. Through its actions, the NDIS supports effective progress in implementing the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with a Disability (UNCRPD).</p><p>Meetings of the DSG occur quarterly. These occur after the Departmental Consultative Committee meetings and before meetings of the NDIS Steering Group, which I chair as Minister of State with Responsibility for Disability. To date in 2022, the DSG have met on four occasions. February 1<sup>st</sup>, March 16<sup>th</sup>, June 7<sup>th</sup>, and September 8<sup>th</sup>2022. The February meeting was an introductory meeting for the newly appointed DSG, and the other three meetings were part of the NDIS monitoring process. The next meeting of the group will take place on November 29<sup>th</sup>. Minutes of these meetings are published on the DSG website. Selected Members of the DSG attend Departmental Consultative Committees and all may attend the NDIS steering Group meetings.</p><p>In relation to the Report the Deputy has referred to, the Department of Social Protection commissioned Indecon to carry out research into the cost of disability in Ireland. The report produced by Indecon was published in November 2021. It provides an analysis of a range of additional costs faced by people with disabilities in Ireland. The Cost of Disability Report was referred to the NDIS by Government decision and presented to the Steering Group in December 2021.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to the use the research into the cost of disability incurred by individuals and families to inform the direction of future policy. The findings have implications for many areas of public policy including the delivery of care services, health, housing, education, transport and income supports. This is why a whole-of-Government perspective is needed. Matters relating to the Report are a standing item at meetings of the NDIS Steering Group. DSG members have an opportunity to comment on the progress of Government Departments in this regard at meetings of the National Steering Group.</p></reply>

Phase 1 of the Action Plan, which began in 2021, is expected to take 2 &ndash; 3 years to complete. Phase 1 includes developing new regulations and providing training specific to childminding, amending legislation, further research on ways to support childminders most effectively, and re-examining the funding and financial supports available for childminders.</p><p>A key objective of the National Action Plan for Childminding is to enable parents who use childminders to benefit from State subsidies through the National Childcare Scheme. The Childcare Support Act 2018, which provides a statutory basis for the National Childcare Scheme, specifies that only Tusla-registered providers are eligible to participate. This limitation of public funding schemes to Tusla-registered providers helps to ensure that public funding is provided where there is assurance of the quality of provision. </p><p>Childminders who are currently minding four or more preschool children or seven children of any age, are required to register with Tusla and can already access the increased subsidies for parents announced in Budget 2023.</p><p>While only a small number of childminders are currently required to register with Tusla under the Child Care Act 1991, it is intended that the National Action Plan for Childminding in April 2021-2028 will result in the opening up of the National Childcare Scheme to a much wider cohort.</p><p>The overall objective of the National Action Plan for Childminding is to improve access to high quality and affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare through childminding. The National Action Plan commits to opening the National Childcare Scheme to childminders at the earliest possible opportunity, though it will be necessary first to develop and introduce childminder-specific regulations, and to give childminders adequate time and support to meet regulatory requirements. Actions under way include the development of new, childminder-specific regulations that are proportionate and appropriate to the home environment in which childminders work, as well as the development of new, bespoke training for childminders. </p><p>Since coming into office I have been committed to seeing this process through. A great deal of work still lies ahead, and it is important that we take the time to get this right, as it will involve a major process of change.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that this dedicated agency will undertake the functions currently carried out by Pobal Early Years (including Better Start), the City/County Childcare Committees, as well as operational functions currently undertaken by my Department.  </p>  <p>  A dedicated State agency will assist in the development of a more streamlined structure to better support the delivery of ELC and SAC, and will facilitate my Department in implementing and progressing the significant reform agenda envisaged under First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in advancing this ambitious and transformative reform programme.  My Department has commenced a comprehensive phase of detailed analysis and open planning, consultation, and engagement with sectoral stakeholders, to determine how the recommendation arising from the Review can best be implemented.  This phase will include, inter alia, a detailed design of a new operating model, an examination of all legal requirements, transition and continuity planning, risk management, and a comprehensive evidence-based cost projection for the establishment and annual running costs of a new state agency. This work will culminate in a full agency design and implementation plan which will be presented to Government for approval.</p>  <p>  This work will be carried out under the guidance of a Programme Board comprising inter-departmental representatives and external experts in the fields of early learning and childcare, public sector governance, and major organisational reform projects.  I will be announcing details of the membership of the Programme Board shortly. </p>  <p>  My Department is also committed to ongoing consultation with stakeholders, and engagement in this regard has already commenced. Officials from my Department have met with all organisations comprising the existing operating model, and with other key stakeholders, to brief them on the Review and to provide them with an opportunity to share their feedback and views.  Engagement with a wide range of stakeholders will continue as a key feature of this reform programme as we work together to design a new operating model for the benefit of children and their families, providers and practitioners. </p>  <p>  The implementation of this multifarious reform programme will likely require considerable lead-in time and the full establishment of a new agency will take several years to complete.  A detailed timeline for the design and implementation of this complex programme of work, which will involve multiple strands of interdependent work streams, is currently being developed as part of the design and implementation planning phase currently underway.</p>  <p>  I look forward to bringing a further report to Government following the completion of this phase of what is a significant and transformative reform programme.</p></reply>

With the current minimum hourly NCS subsidy set at &euro;0.50 per hour, the represents an additional &euro;0.90 per hour off the cost of early learning and childcare. This translates to up to &euro;63.00 off families weekly bill for early learning and childcare per child. With up to &euro;22.50 currently available per week, this represents up to an additional &euro;40.50 off weekly costs.</p><p>From 2nd of January 2023, any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy under NCS (see Table) will see an increase in their subsidy. For those who receive a subsidy based on an income assessed subsidy, the amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy rate. The amount of increase individual families will see in their per hour subsidy, will differ widely depending on their current subsidy.</p><p><b>Table 1: Maximum Income Assessed Subsidy</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Child&rsquo;s age</th>       <th>Per Hour</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>24 weeks to 12 months</td>       <td>&euro;5.10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 to 35 months</td>       <td>&euro;4.35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years or older and not yet in school</td>       <td>&euro;3.95</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>School age (or 6 years to 15 years)</td>       <td>&euro;3.75</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition, on 15th September, I launched Together for Better, the new funding model for early learning and childcare. This new funding model will support delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.</p><p>Together for Better brings together three major elements, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), the NCS and Core Funding.</p><p>Core Funding is the new funding stream in operation since 15 September 2022.  A central condition of Core Funding is that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This gives parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensures that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time.</p><p>Participation in the Core Funding is optional and a list of participating services is available online here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/together-for-better/. To date, more than 91% of services are signed-up and thereby agreeing to operating the fee conditions. Parents should also be receiving a copy of their Partner Services fees policy outlined in the Parent Statement. I would encourage parents to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee for support and guidance.

The relevant provisions of the Act of 2015 regarding marriage have been commenced, but the remainder of the Act cannot be, without the enactment of the Amendment Bill. </p><p>The constitutional challenge was adjourned on the basis that wardship would be abolished in orderly fashion via an Act of the Oireachtas. </p><p>The Government is committed to the abolition of wardship and to replacing it with a more person-centred and rights-based functional capacity model. The enactment of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 will allow for the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p><p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) is a very important piece of legislation that changes the existing law on capacity from the status approach of the wardship system to a flexible functional approach, whereby capacity is assessed on an issue and time-specific basis.  </p><p>It will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  Adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements on a phased basis over 3 years from the date of commencement. The Decision Support Service (DSS) will operate the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act and will respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties. </p><p>It should be noted that, outside of the issue of the constitutional challenge, Government is committed to ending wardship primarily as a matter of good policy and the advancement of citizens' rights. A considerable degree of momentum has now built around the commencement of the Act and extensive operational preparations have been made, particularly over the last 18 months, to prepare for commencement of the Act and the full operationalisation of the Decision Support Service, which will implement the new decision support arrangements. It is important that this momentum is not lost and I am committed to commencing the amended 2015 Act in the earliest possible course.</p></reply>

This new funding model supports the delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families as well as stability and sustainability for providers. Together for Better brings together three major programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the new Core Funding scheme. </p>  <p>  Together for Better is about getting the most out of the three early learning and childcare programmes, and ensuring stability and sustainability in the sector. I do not want any services to be faced with financial sustainability issues and I am fully committed to working with any such service to support them in delivering early learning and childcare for the public good.</p>  <p>  We are not seeing any evidence of a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding. Services that are experiencing difficulty and who would like support are encouraged to contact their City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) to access case management supports. Services can be assisted on an individual basis through this route and it also allows for trends and themes across the country to be identified that can inform a more systematic response if necessary. We are not receiving any indications from CCCs that there have been providers reporting financial difficulties and in need of support. This case management process through the CCCs is the route to access additional sustainability funding if required. </p>  <p>  Data from Tusla on numbers of closures in recent months show that the number of closures this year is broadly in line with other years, and reasons for closure (given to Tusla by service providers that have closed) suggests considerable diversity in the reasons for closure. While some services have closed for financial or regulatory reasons, many have closed for other reasons (e.g. retirement of the owner/manager).</p>  <p>  The Department, Pobal and the CCCs continue to closely monitor trends concerning services entering case management and will continue to maintain the availability of Sustainability Funding for individual services at risk.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of Core Funding is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability and accessibility for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers. Core Funding allows for a very substantial increase in the total cost base for the sector without requiring those costs to be passed on to parents. The vast majority of services are seeing substantial increases in funding. No service will see a decrease in funding. Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability.</p>  <p>  With Core Funding in operation for four weeks, key achievements already include:</p>  <p> -  Fee management in place for over 90% services on at least September 2021 levels, to ensure that developments in National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are fully realised by parents.</p>  <p> -  Agreement of Employment Regulation Orders covering staff at all grades in the sector and instituting differential pay rates for graduate staff in certain roles, putting in place a career framework for staff in the sector to support recruitment and retention.</p>  <p> -  Improved pay for an estimated 73% of those working in the sector who will see their wages rise as a result of the Employment Regulation Orders, which would not have been achieved without Core Funding.</p>  <p> -  A significant expansion of capacity, resulting in more hours of provision for parents and children and opportunities for staff to work more hours per week and weeks per year. </p>  <p>  I was delighted to announce under Budget 2023 that the original allocation for Core Funding will be increased to &euro;259 million for Year 1 of the Scheme to meet the cost of expanded capacity that has materialised through the actual application data that has been received to date. In addition, the full year value of Core Funding will increase by &euro;28 million to &euro;287 million in Year 2 of the Scheme, an increase of 11% in the allocation. </p>  <p>  The additional allocation to Core Funding in Year 1 of the Scheme will cover the additional costs arising from substantially increased capacity, and particularly capacity for younger children which we have seen grow significantly, as well as covering the increased costs arising from greater numbers of graduates in leadership roles.</p>  <p>  In Year 2 of the Scheme, I intend to remove the requirement of 3 years&rsquo; experience for graduate premiums and plan to support this change with approximately &euro;4 million, on condition of an ERO reflecting this change for both Graduate Lead Educator and Graduate Managers roles. Many representatives in the sector advocated for this development. The additional allocation for Year 2 will also allow for some further developments to Core Funding which may include additional investment through the base rate or more targeted approaches. Any such developments will be driven by analysis of data available through the Core Funding application process.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2023, I also announced major reforms to the NCS from January 2023, which will substantially improve the affordability of early learning and childcare for families.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;121 million has been allocated to the NCS from January 2023 so all families accessing registered early learning and childcare will receive a minimum hourly NCS subsidy of &euro;1.40 off the cost of early learning and childcare. With the current minimum hourly NCS subsidy set at &euro;0.50 per hour, the represents an additional &euro;0.90 per hour off the cost of early learning and childcare. This translates to up to &euro;63.00 off a family's weekly bill for early learning and childcare per child. With up to &euro;22.50 currently available per week, this represents up to an additional &euro;40.50 off weekly costs.</p>  <p>  From 2nd of January 2023, any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy under NCS will see an increase in their subsidy. For those who receive a subsidy based on an income assessed subsidy, the amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy rate. The amount of increase individual families will see in their per hour subsidy, will differ depending on their current subsidy.</p>  <p>  A central condition for all Partner Services is that they must not increase fees above those which were charged last year. This gives parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensures that the significant increases to NCS subsidies announced in Budget 2023 are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time.  Fee management is a key part of the new funding model and features in four of the 25 recommendations laid out in the Expert Group report, developed further to two years of analysis, research and consultation.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 allocates &euro;1,025m to early learning and childcare &ndash; a clear demonstration from Government of the value of the sector. Together for Better aims to transform the sector and I am committed to working with Partner Services delivering early learning and childcare for the public good.</p></reply>

An additional investment in the National Childcare Scheme will increase the minimum subsidy from 50c to &euro;1.40. This translates to up to &euro;63.00 off families&rsquo; weekly bill for early learning and childcare per child. With up to &euro;22.50 currently available per week, this represents up to an additional &euro;40.50 off weekly costs.</p>  <p>  It will also mean that any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy will see an increase in their subsidy. For those who have an award less than the maximum subsidy, the amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy. </p>  <p>  In terms of income the largest increase (an extra 90c per hour) will be seen by those on net income of &euro;60,000 and above; all families with reckonable income of &euro;26,000 and above will see some level of increase with the rate of increase tapering off as they move closer to &euro;26,000. Those at &euro;26,000 and below are already on the highest levels of subsidy. </p>  <p>  The exact reduction in costs will be unique to each family depending on their personal circumstances and childcare needs including location specific variables such as service provider. However, a subsidy copayment tool will be made available in the coming weeks to help estimate increased subsidies available. It will be available on ncs.gov.ie</p>  <p>  On 15th September, I launched Together for Better, the new funding model for early learning and childcare. This new funding model will support delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.</p>  <p>  Together for Better brings together three major elements, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model, the National Childcare Scheme and Core Funding.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is the new funding stream in operation since 15 September 2022.  A central condition of Core Funding is that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This gives parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensures that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time.</p>  <p>  Participation in the Core Funding is optional and a list of participating services is available online here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/together-for-better/. To date, more than 90% of services are signed-up and thereby agreeing to operating the fee conditions. Parents should also be receiving a copy of their Partner Services fees policy outlined in the Parent Statement. I would encourage parents to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee for support and guidance.

Every year, more than 100,000 children participate in the universal pre-school programme (ECCE) and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidises more than 80,000 children.</p>  <p>  Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups and in certain areas.</p>  <p>  Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, with a particular focus on monitoring Covid-19 impacts as public health restrictions have been lifted and on responding to the unmet early learning and childcare needs of families. Data captured earlier this year parallels the pre-Covid-19 context, whereby the supply of early learning and childcare places is meeting demand though there is evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p>  <p>  In April of this year, City/County Childcare Committees (CCC) undertook a nationwide survey of capacity in early learning and childcare services. This survey was followed in May by the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Survey that is undertaken by Pobal.</p>  <p>  Preliminary analysis of the latest data captured by CCC and Pobal reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13.3% and the overall vacancy rate in Dublin City averaging at 12.4%.</p>  <p>  The network of 30 CCC across the country, including Dublin City CCC are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. In addition, the CCC has been mobilised to engage proactively with services to identify vacant places and to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need. Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact Dublin CCC for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, a range of other steps are being taken by my Department to address issues of under supply.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places.</p>  <p>  Under the National Action Plan for Childminding, my Department has committed to opening up access to the NCS to parents who use childminders following the extension of regulation to childminders, which is expected to happen within the first 2-3 years of the Plan.</p>  <p>  My Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, is in the process of updating the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings.</p>  <p>  In addition, the new Core Funding scheme, introduced on 15 September, has given rise to a significant growth in capacity - with initial analysis showing a significant capacity growth for certain cohorts (such as babies and toddlers) and in areas where there has been significant pressure on places, including Dublin.</p>  <p>  To meet the cost of this capacity growth, I recently announced that the original allocation for Core Funding will be increased to &euro;259 million for Year 1 of the Scheme. In addition, the full year value of Core Funding will increase by &euro;28 million to &euro;287 million in Year 2 of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  Funding earmarked for the Scheme in Year 2 will be informed by the emerging data from Year 1 and may focus on promoting further capacity expansion.</p></reply>

Of these, 972 are based in Dublin. This is a tremendous level of uptake and will make a positive impact for parents and children using these services through investment in quality and in affordability with more funding for staff and a commitment not to increase fees.</p>  <p>  Stakeholder engagement has been a key part of the development of the new funding model from the beginning. The Expert Group tasked with reviewing the existing model and developing the new model undertook a widespread programme of stakeholder consultation and engagement. Over two years they heard from parents, providers, the workforce, the public, and other stakeholders, all of which is documented and published.</p>  <p>  Since Core Funding was announced last year as part of Budget 2022, my Department has hosted eight meetings of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum, and several Core Funding specific meetings with the Forum, provider representatives, and the Joint Labour Committee.  In particular, during August and September, there were frequent meetings with provider representative groups in preparation for the commencement of Core Funding. </p>  <p>  Representations received from individual providers on Core Funding have been shared with the relevant Officials. I have also met with and visited a number of early learning and childcare services.</p>  <p>  While a large majority of providers have embraced Core Funding, some have raised concerns about the impact of the changes to the funding model on small services in particular.  The rationale for the change in approach is to allow for a fairer distribution of supports for graduate staff and I have been unequivocal that no service will lose out in the funding this year compared to last year.  The safety net of sustainability supports is available for the small number who may experience financial difficulty.</p>  <p>  We are not seeing any evidence of a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding. Services that are experiencing difficulty and who would like support are encouraged to contact their City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) to access case management supports.

This case management process through the CCCs is the route to access additional sustainability funding if required. The Department, Pobal and the CCC&rsquo;s continue to closely monitor trends concerning services entering case management and will continue to maintain the availability of Sustainability Funding for individual services at risk.</p>  <p>  Across the country, the 30 CCCs have been working intensively to support individual providers and parents with the new scheme and continue to be available to do so.</p>  <p>  With Core Funding in operation for four weeks, key achievements already include:</p>  <p>  - Fee management in place for over 90% services on at least September 2021 levels, to ensure that developments in National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are fully realised by parents.</p>  <p>  - Agreement of Employment Regulation Orders covering staff at all grades in the sector and instituting differential pay rates for graduate staff in certain roles, putting in place a career framework for staff in the sector to support recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  - Improved pay for an estimated 73% of those working in the sector who will see their wages rise as a result of the Employment Regulation Orders, which would not have been achieved without Core Funding.</p>  <p>  - A significant expansion of capacity, resulting in more hours of provision for parents and children and opportunities for staff to work more hours per week and weeks per year. </p>  <p>  I was delighted to announce under Budget 2023 that the original allocation for Core Funding will be increased to &euro;259 million for Year 1 of the Scheme to meet the cost of expanded capacity that has materialised through the actual application data that has been received to date.

The additional allocation for Year 2 will also allow for some further developments to Core Funding which may include additional investment through the base rate or more targeted approaches. Any such developments will be driven by analysis of data available through the Core Funding application process.</p></reply>

This survey was followed in May by the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Survey that is undertaken by Pobal.</p><p>Preliminary analysis of the latest data captured by CCC and Pobal reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13.3%.</p><p>The network of CCC already play a proactive role in this area. </p><p>As well as gathering capacity data on behalf of my Department, the network of 30 CCC across the country also use available data to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. In addition, they have been mobilised to engage proactively with services to identify vacant places and to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need and they routinely engage with local authorities on this issue.</p><p>In line with a commitment in First 5, my Department has committed to strengthening its approach to managing supply and demand. </p><p>A range of steps are being taken in this regard.</p><p>Among these steps is work underway to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG).</p><p>To date, this has involved a detailed review of the 2001 Planning Guidelines, with a survey of Local Authorities by DHPLG on current planning issues to roll out later this year. </p><p>As part of this work, to strengthen the role of my Department in managing supply and demand, the DHPLG is currently supporting is the inclusion of my Department in the updated lists of prescribed bodies (authorities) that need to be notified on certain planning matters. This will involve updating Article 11, 12 and 13 concerning notices on the formulation of County Development Plans and Article 14 concerning notices on the formulation Local Area Plans. </p><p>It is hoped updated draft Planning Guidelines will be available for consultation in early 2023.</p><p>An important and wider consideration in this work is the impact of Core Funding. Though this scheme is only in place since 15 September, initial analysis shows that there have been a significant growth in capacity in terms of place hours offered - with capacity growth for cohorts (such as babies and toddlers) and in areas where there has been significant pressure on places. </p><p>Applications for Core Funding continue to be received and more in depth analysis of Core Funding application data will allow for a more up to date and detailed picture of capacity to emerge.</p></reply>

An additional investment in the National Childcare Scheme will increase the minimum subsidy from 50c to &euro;1.40. This translates to up to &euro;63.00 off families&rsquo; weekly bill for early learning and childcare per child. With up to &euro;22.50 currently available per week, this represents up to an additional &euro;40.50 off weekly costs.</p>  <p>  It will also mean that any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy will see an increase in their subsidy. For those who have an award less than the maximum subsidy, the amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy. </p>  <p>  In terms of income the largest increase (an extra 90c per hour) will be seen by those on net income of &euro;60,000 and above; all families with reckonable income of &euro;26,000 and above will see some level of increase with the rate of increase tapering off as they move closer to &euro;26,000. Those at &euro;26,000 and below are already on the highest levels of subsidy. </p>  <p>  The exact reduction in costs will be unique to each family depending on their personal circumstance and childcare needs.

These factors are generally accepted to include global supply chain issues relating to rebounding global demand post COVID-19; and the impact of the invasion of Ukraine on international commodity supplies especially grain/oilseeds and energy supplies.  These issues are significant and are having impacts right across the economy. </p>  <p>  In relation to the remit of my Department which includes responsibility for competition and consumer rights law, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the independent statutory body responsible for promoting compliance with, and enforcing, competition and consumer protection law in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In relation to the CCPC&rsquo;s mandate in this area, their role is to ensure that prices are set independently by competing businesses, and those prices are then prominently displayed at the point of sale thereby enabling consumers to make informed choices about which supplier offers the best value. The CCPC do not tell businesses what prices to charge. Generally, traders in Ireland are free to set and change their prices for goods and services. Lower prices play a key role in attracting consumers, and traders compete to keep their prices low enough to attract consumers.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the issues around supplies and their costs, businesses must behave competitively. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which is independent in the exercise of its functions, has powers to:</p>  <p>  - Enforce competition and consumer protection rules that ensure businesses set prices independently and communicate them appropriately to consumers;</p>  <p>  - Ensure that mergers do not result in a significant lessening of competition, which carries a risk of higher pricing;</p>  <p>  - Help to educate and inform consumers so they are able to shop around, and in doing so add to the competitive pressure on businesses when they set their prices; and</p>  <p>  - Conduct a market study if it suspects that there is a market failure or dysfunction that results in pricing that is causing consumer harm.</p>  <p>  - Excessive pricing may be illegal if a business is in a dominant position, where it faces little competition, and its customers have little bargaining power. When a business is dominant, it is not allowed to abuse its position. Businesses and their pricing decisions are constrained by the need to compete rather than by any legal obligation.</p>  <p>  When the CCPC receives complaints about pricing it assesses them to see if they indicate a possible breach of competition or consumer protection law. It can also take action on its own initiative when it suspects there may have been a breach. </p></reply>

This is why a &euro;2.4 billion package of supports was implemented during 2022, and a package of once off measures worth &euro;2.5 billion included in Budget 2023. The Budget package includes a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through which &euro;550.47 (exclusive of VAT) will be credited to each domestic electricity account in three payments of &euro;183.49 (exclusive of VAT) in each of the following billing periods - November/December 2022, January/February 2023 and March/April 2023. The estimated cost of this scheme is &euro;1.211 billion and will be provided to my Department through a Supplementary Estimate.<br /><br />The payment will be applied to domestic electricity accounts, including those with Pay As You Go meters, which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2). The scheme uses the single identifier of the Meter Point Registration Number (MPRN) to ensure it can be administered automatically and without an application/approval process. This mechanism allowed payments to be made automatically to 2,138,939 domestic electricity accounts, over 99.36% of eligible accounts, under the first scheme which operated between April and June of this year. <br /><br />While the majority of residential tenants will hold their own domestic electricity accounts, and therefore receive the credit directly, others could have tenancy agreements where tenants pay their actual share of each bill and, in those cases, will benefit from the payment because the amount of the bill will be reduced by the amount of the payment. A small proportion could have other arrangements in place whereby electricity costs are part of the rental cost. Where tenants have a dispute relating to tenancies including any terms relating to electricity payments, these can be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for dispute resolution. As there is not data set identifying this cohort, increasing awareness of entitlements of existing social protection measures, which include provision for help with household bills, is an important way of supporting people in this situation.<br /><br />In addition, as part of its suite of once-off measures, Budget 2023 allocates &euro;340 million for support for communities including sports bodies and community organisations.<br /><br />Along with the Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme Budget 2023 also introduced measures including:<br /><br />- &euro;400 lump sum payment to Fuel Allowance recipients <br /><br />- &euro;200 lump sum payment for pensioners and people with a disability getting the Living Alone Increase<br /><br />- &euro;500 cost of living lump sum payment to all families getting Working Family Payment<br /><br />- double payment of Child Benefit to support all families with children<br /><br />- &euro;500 cost of living payment for people receiving Carer's Support Grant will be paid in November<br /><br />- &euro;500 lump sum cost of living disability support grant will be paid to all people receiving a long term disability payment<br /><br />Furthermore, CRU has a dedicated email address for members of the public to contact them on matters such as this Customer Care Team - Commission for Regulation of Utilities (cru.ie)<br /><br />The CRU also has a dedicated email address for deputies to contact them oireachtas@cru.ie for timely replies.</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The scheme uses the single identifier of the Meter Point Registration Number (MPRN) to ensure it can be administered automatically and without an application/approval process.</p><p>On 22 September I announced the extension of Government supports of up to &euro;2,400 for the installation of solar PV panels for non-domestic buildings &ndash; aimed specifically at businesses, public organisations and community groups. The new grants are the next phase in the Government&rsquo;s Microgeneration Support Scheme (MSS) and are administered through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The scheme provides grant funding of up to &euro;2,400 towards the installation of solar PV technology up to a maximum of 6kWp, which is approximately 16 solar panels. This provides an opportunity for all areas of the non-domestic sector to not only reduce their electricity bills, but to visibly demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and Ireland&rsquo;s broader climate action goals.</p><p>At the current high electricity prices, businesses, including the community group identified by the Deputy, have the potential to save &euro;2,000-3,000 per annum from a solar PV system supported under this scheme. Moreover, with the introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG), any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises is now eligible for an export payment which further supports the investment. This means that the installation can pay for itself quickly &ndash; thus helping to protect businesses and organisations across the country against rising energy prices into the future. Solar PV is also one of a range of measures funded under the SEAI Communities Energy Grant Scheme which makes grant funding available to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock and is open to domestic and non-domestic applications. To apply for a grant, non-domestic applicants should visit www.seai.ie and follow the outlined steps.</p><p>In addition, as part of its suite of once-off measures, Budget 2023 allocates &euro;340 million for support for communities including sports bodies and community organisations.</p></reply>

This will ensure that the most polluting can no longer be made available on the Irish market and will assist the public in transitioning to less polluting alternatives.New regulations on the use of solid fuels for domestic heating are necessary as each year some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland from illnesses which are caused or exacerbated by air pollution from solid fuel burning. It is further estimated that there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution. I remain committed to addressing this critical public health and environmental challenge.</p><p>In September 2021, I announced that the regulations would come into effect for the 2022/2023 heating season. I made the announcement at that time in order to allow retailers sufficient time to run down existing stocks and plan accordingly for the introduction of the new regulatory framework.</p><p>Over the past year, officials from my Department have been working with retailer representative bodies to support the transition to the new regulations and have been running an awareness campaign for the past number of months to inform retailers and producers of their responsibilities. More information for retailers can be found at <i>www.gov.ie/cleanair/.</i></p><p>Enforcement actions will be a matter for Local Authorities and once the regulations are introduced. Initial enforcement efforts will focus on working with and helping retailers in understanding and complying with their obligations under the new framework.</p></reply>

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU adopted alleviation measures to address the impact that travel and public health related restrictions had on the ability of airlines to retain use of slots at congested EU airports as permission to use such slots is largely based on historic use; the so-called &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; rule.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the alleviation measures was to reduce the commercial risk to airlines from non-utilisation of airport slots where traffic had fallen away. The alleviation measures applied have been gradually reduced as travel restrictions have been lifted and European aviation recovers from the impact of the pandemic. However, to address any continuing uncertainty due to COVID-19 and the situation in Ukraine, additional alleviation measures for the upcoming winter scheduling period and a period beyond is currently being considered at EU level.</p>  <p>  My officials are liaising with our State and regional airports to collate information on any scheduled passenger air services that operated at less than 10% passenger capacity for the years requested and will provide this information to the Deputy when it becomes available.</p>  <p>  Any airline operating "ghost" flights solely to retain control/use of certain airport slots is, of course, a cause for concern particularly from an environmental perspective. However, it should be borne in mind that flights may have operated with lower passenger numbers in order to ensure the continued flow of air cargo during the pandemic, or to ensure that aircraft remained operationally ready. Situations such as these should be considered when interpreting any data that becomes available.</p></reply>

The Greenway works are ongoing and it is not considered appropriate to delay these as the road-widening solution has yet to be agreed. </p>  <p>  I understand that Route W6 is planned to start during the first half of 2023. Initially this route will operate in two sections. As the Deputy is aware, there is an issue with the width of the road south of the canal at Hazelhatch Bridge that makes it difficult for one bus to successfully pass another. I understand that the NTA are currently working on an engineering solution to resolve this, however as it is desirable to deliver a number of the benefits of the service as soon as possible it is likely that the route will be operated as two separate routes in the short term with the W61 operating from Maynooth (Moyglare) to Hazelhatch Station and the W62 operating from Newcastle to Tallaght.</p>  <p>  I further understand that the benefits of the full route will be delivered as soon as an engineering solution is developed, agreed between the NTA and South Dublin County Council and implemented. Meanwhile the temporary W61 and W62 services will enable the NTA to provide a service to the Moyglare area in Maynooth, strengthen links to rail and Luas at Hazelhatch, Saggart and City West, and deliver a bus link between Newcastle and Tallaght. It is anticipated that the temporary services will need to be in place for 12-18 months and the NTA will be working to minimise this time period.</p></reply>

This means that, where a sports club is established for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games and is an approved body for the purposes of section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, it will be eligible for support under the scheme in respect of its trading activities.</p><p>Businesses that do not carry on a trade, and would generally be regarded as a profession taxable under Case II of Schedule D, are not currently included in the scheme. Any decision regarding the extension of the scope of the scheme would be a matter for the Finance Bill. </p><p>It is proposed that the scheme will operate by comparing the average unit price for the relevant bill period in 2022 with the average unit price in the corresponding reference period in 2021.

A monthly cap of &euro;10,000 will apply and an overall cap will apply on the total amount a business can claim in accordance with the State Aid Temporary Crisis Framework.</p><p>The operational details of the scheme are being worked through by officials and will be available soon. </p></reply>

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).</p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. </p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. In fact, the rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs). This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. </p>  <p>  This new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. </p></reply>

This framework provides for the publication of certain information about recipients. </p><p>The TBESS will be open to businesses that carry on a Case I trade, are tax compliant and have experienced a significant increase in their natural gas and electricity costs. The scheme will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners and will operate on a self-assessment basis. </p><p>  It is proposed that the scheme will operate by comparing the average unit price for the relevant bill period in 2022 with the average unit price in the corresponding reference period in 2021. If the increase in average unit price is more than 50% then the threshold has passed and the business is eligible for support under the scheme.  A business who has not seen an increase of 50% over the period will not be eligible for the scheme.</p><p>  Once eligibility criteria are met, the support for businesses will be calculated on the basis of 40% of the amount of the increase in the bill amount. A monthly cap of &euro;10,000 per trade will apply and an overall cap will apply on the total amount a business can claim in accordance with the State Aid Temporary Crisis Framework.</p><p>Where a business meets all of the criteria for the scheme, they may apply for support under the scheme subject to the applicable caps.</p><p>The operational details of the scheme are being worked through by officials and will be available soon.</p></reply>

Department of Finance officials provide support to the Department of Health in this matter.</p>  <p>  The first campaign closed on 29th April however this did not result in sufficient suitable candidates coming forward. Therefore, a second round was issued with a closing date of 5th July 2022. From these two campaigns, three suitable candidates have been identified and are completing Garda vetting.

I understand that the Deputy is asking about Section 75 of the 2005 Act which legislates for the ascertainment of retail prices of tobacco products, which had previously been dealt with in Section 84 of the earlier Act. </p><p>The TPT provisions of Finance Act 2005 are subject to Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco, often referred to as the Tobacco Tax Directive. Article 7 of the Directive sets out that the excise duty on cigarettes shall be made up of two components:  an <i>ad valorem</i>portion which is to be calculated using the maximum retail selling price of the product, and a second portion calculated by applying a specific rate of tax per unit of the product. Member States have no scope to alter the specific requirements set out in the Directive regarding the use of maximum retail selling prices in calculating the <i>ad valorem</i>portion of excise duty applying to cigarettes.  Article 15 of the Directive states that manufacturers and importers of cigarettes shall be free to determine the maximum retail selling price of cigarettes. Therefore, this approach cannot be changed by a Member State.</p><p>Section 75 of Finance Act 2005 provides for the <i>ad valorem</i>(i.e. value based) portion of the TPT to be based on the retail price of the tobacco product. Section 75 also places an obligation on tobacco manufacturers and importers to make a declaration to Revenue detailing the maximum retail selling price for each tobacco product they manufacture or import. This information is required to ensure the <i>ad valorem</i>(i.e. value based) portion of the TPT is calculated correctly. Under Section 79 of the Finance Act 2005 it is an offence for a retailer to present cigarettes for sale for a higher price than that which has been declared to the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the introduction of the National Claims Information Database (NCID) within the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) was a key step change in improving transparency, providing information and an evidence base for policy formation. </p><p>Currently the NCID reports on private motor insurance and employers&rsquo; liability, public liability and commercial property insurance, providing information on claims, and in turn the impact these have on insurance costs. Ireland is unique in the EU in having this level of information, allowing us to analyse and understand industry-level developments. </p><p>I would note that the NCID has been well received by all sides of this House, as well as by the general public. It is a valuable resource and therefore it is important that it be sufficiently funded to ensure it continues to provide an evidence base as part of the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda. The fourth NCID Private Motor Report, to be published later this quarter, will contain some initial insights as to the impact of the <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines </i>introduced in 2021.</p><p>The NCID is underpinned by legislation, namely the <i>Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018</i>. While the CBI is responsible for the NCID, it is important to note that this is not deemed to be a &ldquo;central bank task&rdquo; under European law, as per the European Central Bank&rsquo;s Opinion (CON/2018/43) on this legislation. Therefore, the CBI is not permitted to pay for the cost of establishing and running the NCID from its own resources. This provision is designed to ensure Member State governments do not outsource &ldquo;non-bank&rdquo; activities to their central banks and leave them with the associated costs.</p><p>Consequently, Section 11 of the 2018 Act requires the CBI to make Regulations to recoup the cost of the NCID by prescribing levies to be paid by insurance undertakings. These levies should not be directly charged to consumers. This provision has been in place since 2018 when passed by the Oireachtas, with industry having been aware of it.</p><p>The Central Bank is working on a regulation to establish a levy which will recoup the Bank's costs in operating the NCID. I understand that this work will be completed in the coming months. When that work is completed, the Bank will provide details on how the levy is calculated. The money raised will cover, on a retrospective basis, the set-up and design cost of both NCID databases. Furthermore, I understand that it is proposed that the ongoing running cost of the NCID publications will now be met on an annual basis.</p><p>At this point, the preparations are proceeding through the Central Bank&rsquo;s internal approval processes and will be made known in the coming months. Accordingly, I am unable to comment any further until I am briefed on the outcome of the ongoing work of the Central Bank. </p></reply>

Under the scheme, businesses can temporarily &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain tax debts on an interest free basis until the end of this year (or until 30 April 2023 for businesses who qualified for the warehoused extension). However, to remain eligible for the Debt Warehousing Scheme, in addition to filing all returns for the warehouse periods, current liabilities must also be filed and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Revenue commenced a phased return to standard debt collection for non-warehoused debt i.e. current liabilities, which had been partially suspended since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. As part of Revenue&rsquo;s standard debt collection procedure, where current taxes become overdue, a request for payment will issue with details of the tax(es) due, requesting payment within a set timeframe. The request for payment outlines the consequences of continued non-payment and affords the taxpayer up to 10 days to engage. In the absence of customer engagement, a final demand issues allowing another 7 days for the customer to engage. Where there is continued lack of engagement from the customer in response to these notices, the case is escalated for further action. </p>  <p>  Generally, on receipt of a 7-day final demand, the majority of taxpayers take action to resolve their payment difficulty. Revenue encourages taxpayers to engage early when payment difficulties arise, particularly during the current energy costs crisis.  Revenue has a strong track record of successfully working with individuals and businesses to resolve their payment difficulties. In most cases, a mutually satisfactory solution is found without resorting to enforcement action.  For example, taxpayers can enter into a Phased Payment Arrangement to pay off their debt in instalments over a period of time. </p>  <p>  The important message for taxpayers who receive these notices is to engage with Revenue at the earliest opportunity so that a mutually acceptable solution can be found to enable them work through their difficulties. I am assured that Revenue appreciates the challenge for businesses in paying their outstanding liabilities in a difficult economic and financial climate and Revenue is committed to finding solutions which are flexible, and which take account of the financial circumstances of the business concerned. </p></reply>

Significant funding has been secured and is being made available to support delivery of Cost Rental by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), Local Authorities and by the Land Development Agency (LDA).</p>  <p>  Delivery will increase incrementally, to an average of 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year. 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026. AHBs will be supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding and Local Authorities will be able to avail of funding for Cost Rental delivery through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF). The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental on its own portfolio of sites, or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.</p>  <p>  International events have contributed to an increase in the cost of loan co-financing and the trajectory of interest rates which impacts AHB delivery of Cost Rental homes as well as all housing providers. Combined with the ongoing impact of construction cost inflation, the viability of schemes has become more challenging, negatively affecting the required level of cost rent paid by tenants.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, Government has decided that it is appropriate to increase the funding ceilings available per dwelling delivered for both the CREL and AHF schemes. My Department is working on operationalising these increases. The changes for both schemes will be subject to defined criteria which allows the demonstration of need and the operational parameters for implementation are currently being finalised and will be completed over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 saw the funding allocation for CREL increase from &euro;70m in 2022 to &euro;75m for next year, while funding for Local Authorities through the AHF rose from &euro;60m in 2022 to &euro;90m for 2023. The changes to these two schemes, combined with the increased funding available, will help to address some of the challenges faced by AHBs and Local Authorities in the continued implementation of Cost Rental schemes.  The funding available will help to continue to target rents achievable for Exchequer-supported Cost Rental homes at a minimum discount of 25% below open market rates.</p></reply>

These include the Pyrite Remediation Scheme and the Defective Concrete Blocks Scheme, both of which are underpinned by legislation.</p><p>In regard to defects in purpose-built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013, following receipt of the report of the working group I established to examine this issue, I am currently developing options which I intend to bring to Government before the end of the year with a view to providing support for homeowners who find themselves in a difficult financial situation through no fault of their own.  </p><p>In addition, a range of building control reforms which focus on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance with Building Regulations have been implemented.  This includes:</p><p>a. implementation of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 9 of 2014). These Regulations empower competence and professionalism in construction projects and establish a chain of responsibility that begins with the owner.  With certain limited exceptions, the owner must assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify the building works who, in turn, must account for their role through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates.  The roles and responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, assigned certifiers, etc. during building works are set out in the <i>Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works.</i>The Code of Practice also provides guidance on use of proper materials and the need to check supporting documentation under the Construction Products Regulation (e.g Declaration of Performance) and additional national guidance (e.g. Standard Recommendations produced by NSAI).</p><p>b. the creation of the National Building Control Management Project and the establishment of the National Building Control &amp;amp; Market Surveillance Office to provide oversight, support and direction for the development, standardisation and implementation of Building Control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities.</p><p>c. The enactment in July 2022 of the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.  This Act develops and promotes a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations in the construction sector. The Act will put the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing and aims to benefit consumers and the general public by giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator. The Act also allows for complaints against registered builders to be made on a number of grounds &ndash; in particular an entity providing building services in a category in which they are not registered.  It provides for a range of proportionate sanctions to be imposed after investigation. Complaints in relation to building regulations will continue to be dealt with under the Building Control Act.</p><p>To further support the building control system, preparatory work is progressing on establishing an independent Building Standards Regulator to oversee building control nationwide and to act as custodian of the Building Control Management System.</p><p>Other significant pieces of redress and producers&rsquo; liability legislation which may apply to construction products are the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980; and the Liability for Defective Products Act 1991 which fall under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p></reply>

Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for HAP. Eligible households can source their own accommodation in the private rental sector which should be within the HAP rent limits provided to them by the local authority.</p>  <p>  The HAP scheme is legislated for under Part 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. Consistent with the provisions in section 46 of the 2014 Act, once approved for HAP, the local authority will expect the HAP tenant to stay in the same property for at least two years.  </p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended, all development, unless specifically exempted under the Act or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.  In some cases, when the initial planning permission for a holiday home is sought, planning authorities have additionally specified by way of planning condition (such as an occupancy clause) that such holiday homes cannot be used for permanent residential purposes.  It is considered that a change of use of a holiday home to a place of permanent residence would be a material change of use requiring planning permission. </p>  <p>  If the owner of a holiday home wishes for the premises to be used as place of permanent residence, then they may lodge a planning application to the relevant planning authority for a change of use from holiday home to residential use.  It is a matter for the planning authority to decide such applications on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to HAP, including the suitability of HAP accommodation, is a matter for the local authority concerned.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p><p>Section 16 of the RTA obliges a tenant to pay any charges or taxes in accordance with the lease or tenancy agreement unless they are unlawful or contravene any other enactment.</p><p>In general, the question of whether or not a tenant has to pay charges to a landlord depends on the terms of the lease or tenancy agreement. The amount of any such charges, if applicable, is a matter to be agreed between landlord and tenant.  Contract law governs such arrangements. The specific terms associated with an individual tenants rights and obligations are likely to be set out in a written contract signed by both the tenant and the landlord.</p><p>While the vast majority of people who rent their homes have their own Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN), there may be some who could have arrangements whereby their landlord holds the MPRN and energy costs are paid to the landlord. There is no data set identifying this cohort. My Department and the RTB has worked with the Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications  to make people aware of the RTB mediation services available to tenants in the event landlords do not pass on credits to tenants. The RTB has reported that contacts with them on this matter were extremely low with regard to the first Electricity Account Credit Scheme. </p><p>The RTB takes illegal eviction, including by the cutting off of essential utility services, very seriously as it can potentially leave a tenant homeless. The RTB actively intervenes when requests for supports are received in the context of illegal evictions and its interventions are usually successful. While a request for tenant support can be in relation to access to property and return of belongings, the focus of the RTB&rsquo;s intervention is the maintenance of the tenancy.</p><p>The RTB engages with landlords to advise on the serious consequences of illegal evictions, including the possibility of being directed to allow the tenant re-entry into the dwelling and the possibility of being required to pay substantial damages if a dispute case is referred by the tenant to the RTB for resolution.</p><p>As the RTB has replaced the courts in residential tenancy dispute resolution, it has a responsibility towards all parties to ensure that a fair hearing is conducted and that each party will have the opportunity to set out their case. Any RTB decision is based on the facts and evidence of the case.</p><p>Where a landlord is determined under a RTB dispute resolution process to have engaged in an illegal eviction, the landlord may be directed to allow the tenant to re-enter the dwelling. Furthermore, a landlord may also be required to pay substantial damages (up to &euro;20,000) depending on the circumstances of the case.</p><p>In the vast majority of cases, the immediate threat to eviction is abated through RTB intervention and dispute resolution cases. Where a resolution cannot be found, and a tenant has been forcibly removed from a property, the RTB may seek a court injunction under section 189 of the RTA to have the tenant reinstated until a dispute resolution case is concluded.</p></reply>

Its objective is to provide public off-site infrastructure to relieve critical infrastructure blockages to housing delivery. This enables the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in Dublin and in urban areas of high demand. LIHAF was designed to specifically address the issue of housing supply, a crucial factor in terms of moderating house prices. Infrastructure being funded under LIHAF includes access roads, distributor roads, link roads, road improvements, roundabouts, bridges and parks.</p>  <p>  In 2017, grant agreements for 30 approved projects were signed between my Department and local authorities. One such project is at Maynooth, Co. Kildare. Kildare County Council were approved grant funding for the construction of the Maynooth Eastern Relief Road (MERR) and a bridge crossing a railway and the Royal Canal. The total approved grant funding for this project is &euro;14.5m with &euro;10.88m (75%) being funded by my Department and the remaining 25% being funded by Kildare County Council. To date, Kildare County Council have drawn down &euro;814,000 in exchequer funding for project costs associated with this LIHAF project.</p>  <p>  I understand that developers are currently engaged in the planning process for the delivery of housing units on LIHAF lands.

Schools are advised to consult with members of the school community including parents when planning for the introduction of digital technologies including devices with cost and other implications been fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made.</p>  <p>  Schools, in conjunction with parents, are responsible for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of laptops and tablets in schools.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by educators and parents in relation to costs of digital technology, including tablets, and my Department continues to work to help support schools and families meet these costs. In 2017 a circular letter issued to schools with measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs including such ICT devices: assets.gov.ie/12695/2045e7ccec684f72b55d93930e45372c.pdf.</p>  <p>  This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents, and how to avoid costs acting as a barrier. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.).</p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2027, which builds on the progress made under the previous Digital Strategy, will be underpinned by an investment of some &euro;200m included in the National Development Plan 2021-2030 providing continuity of funding following the &euro;210m that issued to schools to support the previous strategy. The first tranche of the successor Digital Strategy ICT grant funding issued to schools in December 2021. This funding issued directly to schools as schools are best placed to identify the requirements of their own student cohort and to meet those requirements in the most appropriate way. This can include the purchase of ICT devices such as tablets, hybrid devices, or laptops. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) under Next Generation EU funding facility, issued a once-off grant of &euro;50 million in December 2021 to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme in order to support those learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide,</p>  <p>  Details of the Grant Scheme for EU NRRP Funding to schools to address the digital divide, and learners at risk of educational disadvantage which can be found at: www.gov.ie/en/circular/b4fea-grant-scheme-for-eu-nrrp-funding-to-schools-to-address-the-digital-divide-and-learners-at-risk-of-educational-disadvantage/.</p>  <p>  My Department has established a Single Provider Framework for the purchase of laptops and desktop PCs, to enable schools to easily access such infrastructure with transparent costing. Schools can also access procurement mechanisms for Apple devices established by HEAnet Ireland's National Education and Research Network. The Schools Procurement Unit (SPU) established by my Department is the central support resource for providing guidance to all primary and post-primary schools (except ETB schools) on any procurement-related issue. The SPU delivers free advice and practical support to schools to help them achieve improvements in their procurement processes, practices and outcomes.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the school Management Authority to ensure that all teaching posts will be filled. Vacancies may arise in schools as a result of additional teaching posts, retirements, teachers moving to another school, career breaks, job sharing arrangements, etc. Once a school has selected a successful candidate for a vacancy, they must provide the teacher&rsquo;s details to my Department in order to be set up on payroll.  These details are provided in an appointment form and include details of the teachers&rsquo; appointment, type of contract, Teaching Council registration details, bank details, etc. My Department gives an annual commitment to Schools, teachers, Unions and Education Partners that all correctly completed appointment forms received in Payroll Division in early July will be paid on the first pay date in September. For the 2022/2023 school year these dates were 8th July 2022 for Primary teachers and 1st July, 2022 for Voluntary Secondary and Community and Comprehensive schools teachers. It was not possible to set a relatively small number of these appointment forms up for the first pay date in September as the forms were incomplete. Difficulties were encountered in verifying details with schools or the teacher concerned as they were unavailable during the school summer closure period.</p>  <p>  Appointment forms received after the July dates are processed in date order of receipt and many are processed in time for salary payment on the first pay date of September, or as early as possible thereafter. There are many instances where a school forwards a late appointment form after the start of the school year. </p>  <p>  My Department received in the region of 10,000 appointment forms to dater for the start of the 2022/2023 school year. In order to process this high volume in the months of July and August, the Payroll staff worked overtime during the week, at weekends and were constrained in taking leave.  </p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy that staff in my Department are in direct contact with schools and teachers, on an ongoing basis. They are highly aware of the financial pressure that late payments of salary can place on teachers, especially newly qualified teachers and every effort is made to resolve issues as soon as possible and to ensure prompt payment. The majority of appointment applications have now been processed for the 2022/23 school year, and any outstanding applications are now being processed.</p></reply>

The inclusion programme, which ran for the first time in 2021 at primary and post-primary level, allowed schools to offer a school-based programme to pupils in mainstream settings who have complex needs, as well as pupils who are at risk of educational disadvantage.  A home-based programme has remained available for pupils with complex needs where their school is not running a programme.  The summer programme is open to children who are in foster care and who meet the eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;20 million funding has been approved under Budget &rsquo;23 to continue the expanded summer programme, bringing the total to &euro;40m for 2023.

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.</p>  <p>  The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply:</p>  <p>  a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools. </p>  <p>  b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. </p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: </p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); </p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; </p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014: circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/education/2014/30.pdf.</p>  <p>  Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website: ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE: ncse.ie/ncse-appeals-process.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations.</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>   SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.</p>  <p>  The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply:</p>  <p>  a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools. </p>  <p>  b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. </p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: </p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); </p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; </p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014 circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/education/2014/30.pdf.</p>  <p>  Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE ncse.ie/ncse-appeals-process.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations.</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The provision of health-related supports, including Speech and Language therapy services, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, and matters in relation to the provision of health-related services should therefore be directed to that body or to the Department of Health.</p></reply>

The service provided by NEPS is broad, and encompasses a model that seeks to strengthen the overall capacity of the system to support the wellbeing, participation and inclusion of all children and young people in our schools, but particularly for those with special educational needs.  In schools the psychologist works with teachers, parents and children/young people to provide a range of services. </p><p>The NEPS service provides access for all schools to:</p><p>- Psychological support in the event of a Critical Incident</p><p>- A Casework Service for individual children where there is a need for intensive consultation and assessment and</p><p>- A school staff Support and Development Service, to build school capability to provide a comprehensive continuum of support in schools</p><p>- Ongoing access to advice and support for schools.</p><p>This overall approach allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent individual cases and, through supporting school staff, to benefit many more children than could be seen individually.</p><p>In 2021 the NEPS casework service extended to over 8500 students. Additionally, under the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) process, private psychologists provided assessment to schools for over 900 students. Furthermore, the NEPS Support and Development service reaches an estimated 25,000 teachers annually.</p><p>Where a vacancy arises in NEPS, schools continue to have access to NEPS for critical incident support, for regional support and development service and also to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries, through the local NEPS office.  In relation to a casework service, schools may access a casework service, where there is need, via psychologists on the SCPA panel. The local NEPS office is available to discuss any other requirements that schools may have.  </p><p>Officials in my Department recently met with the Public Appointments Service regarding a recruitment process that is due to commence before the end of this year.</p></reply>

A detailed explanatory paper on the new system has been published on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  Under the design approved by Government AE savings will be contributed by employees with a matching contribution from their employer and a 33% contribution by the State.  While contributions will start at a low level of 1.5% of salary, it is intended that ultimately, after ten years, the employee will pay 6%, the employer will pay a matching 6% and the State will 'top-up' contributions with a further 1%.  This means that for every &euro;3 contributed by the worker a further &euro;4 will be added to their AE savings account.</p>  <p>  The system is expected to become operational in early 2024 and will automatically enrol approximately 750,000 employees at the outset.  Implementation of the AE system is now well underway, with a project team in the Department of Social Protection progressing a range of individual elements of a detailed project plan. </p>  <p>  Most recently, the Government approved a General Scheme for an Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings System Bill.  Just last week, I wrote to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, in order for that Committee to commence pre-legislative scrutiny of the Heads of the Bill.</p>  <p>  A core objective for the AE system is to provide quality assured investment services, and pension products at low cost to AE participants.  To this end, a maximum permitted annual administration and investment management charge will be capped at up to 0.5% of assets under management.  In establishing the Irish AE system, we will conduct open tendering processes in a highly competitive market.  As a result, we fully expect the final charges in the Irish AE system to be less than the ceiling rate of 0.5%.  Low unit operating costs shall also be achieved through economies of scale, which is one of the key reasons behind establishing the Central Processing Authority (CPA).  By acting as a &lsquo;bulk&rsquo; purchaser, the CPA will help to achieve these economies of scale, thereby benefitting the participants in the system.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This represents an increase of 22% in the past 5 years.</p><p>The two principal conditions for receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided, and that the applied means test is satisfied. Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is primarily aimed at carers on low incomes who look after certain people who need full-time care and attention.  </p><p>Like other social assistance payments, the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means-test ensures that scarce resources are targeted at those with the greatest need. </p><p>Earlier this year, I introduced significant improvements to the means test for Carer's Allowance, in recognition of the vital role that carers play in society. These were the first changes to the means test in 14 years:</p><p>-  The capital and savings disregard for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means assessment was increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which applies for Disability Allowance.</p><p>-  For carers who work, the weekly income disregard was increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p><p>The changes outlined came into effect on 2 June and many carers who up to now did not qualify for a payment due to means will now be brought into the Carer's Allowance system for the first time.</p><p>The current Carer's Allowance disregards are the most generous income disregards in the social welfare system and mean that, in the case of a couple, earnings of up to &euro;39,000 a year are disregarded. </p><p>In addition to Carer's Allowance, my department provides non-means tested payment to carers in the form of Carer;s Benefit. Furthermore, the Carer's Support Grant - which I have increased to its highest-ever rate of &euro;1,850 - is available to carers who are not on a social welfare payment. For those providing ongoing care and attention for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, Domiciliary Care Allowance is available and is not means-tested.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;33 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;924 each year) is paid from late September to April.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions for receipt of fuel allowance is that a person must satisfy a means test. The fuel allowance means test is linked to the maximum rate of State pension (contributory).  An individual can have a weekly income of &euro;120.00 above the maximum rate for State pension (contributory) plus any increases for age, living alone and dependants and still be eligible for the fuel allowance. </p>  <p>  On 25 January 2021, the person concerned applied for fuel allowance. Following a means assessment, it was determined that the household means were &euro;1,393.73 which exceeded the permissible weekly means of &euro;570.80 for the household. The application was disallowed, and the person concerned was notified in writing on 14 April 2021.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I announced an increase in the fuel means threshold for those aged under 70 from &euro;120.00 to &euro;200.00 from January 2023. As the household means of &euro;1393.73 exceeds the new permissible means of &euro;703.10 for the household, the person concerned will not qualify for fuel allowance from January 2023.  However, if there has been a change in their circumstances, it is open to them to re-apply for the fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Officials in my department are currently managing large volumes of applications for fuel allowance. If the person concerned has recently submitted a new application for fuel allowance, a decision will be made and they will be notified of the outcome.  </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is the case even if only one of the couple is actually claiming a payment. </p>  <p>  The social welfare system has evolved over time and in response to a variety of factors, including Constitutional imperatives as interpreted by the Courts, changing social trends and EU Directives.</p>  <p>  The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and a subsequent Supreme Court case led to the current treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code. The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.  This means that for social assistance means tested schemes, married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples are all treated in the same manner.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the current State Pension (Contributory) system provides for a range of measures including PRSI credits, Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods of up to 20 years outside of paid employment in the calculation of a payment rate.  Foster carers are entitled to the benefits of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme or HomeCaring Periods, on the same basis as other carers, and will qualify if the carer is in receipt of Child Benefit.  If the foster carer is not in receipt of Child Benefit, s/he can still qualify for Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme or HomeCaring Periods provided the caring periods are confirmed by Tusla. </p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine sustainability and eligibility issues in respect of the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  The terms of reference included consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependants can be accommodated within the State Pension system.  The Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021 and it set out a wide-range of recommendations, including enhanced pension provision for long-term carers. </p>  <p>  I announced a series of landmark reforms to the State Pension system on 20th September 2022.  The measures, which were approved by Cabinet, are in response to the recommendations from the Pensions Commission.  The set of measures represent the biggest ever structural reform of the Irish State Pension system.  One of the reforms agreed by Government is enhanced State Pension provision for long-term carers of incapacitated dependents (who have been caring in excess of 20 years), as recommended by the Pensions Commission, and to be introduced from January 2024.  This will be implemented through:</p>  <p>  -  A scheme to ensure that long-term carers can be attributed with contributions for gaps in their contribution record arising from their time spent caring; and</p>  <p>  -  The establishment of a &lsquo;Family Carer Register'.</p>  <p>  My officials are working to implement the reforms, including the drafting of legislation and development of administrative and IT systems as necessary.  As part of the work to implement the new scheme, relevant Government Departments, and other stakeholders, will examine options for the creation of a statutory &lsquo;Family Carer Register&rsquo; to help identify long-term carers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Every case is based on the individual circumstances/needs of the household.</p><p>In the region of 63% of all additional needs payments applications are being finalised within 4 weeks.  This reflects the need to verify household income and expenditure and assess whether or not the expenditure in respect of which the ANP is requested is essential.

Where an application is complete and accompanied by the required documentation, it is generally processed in a matter of days.

Ongoing eligibility for this pension is conditional on a claimant continuing to habitually reside in the state and continuing to satisfy the applicable means test.</p>  <p>  One of the persons concerned is in receipt of state pension non-contributory, the other is in receipt of invalidity pension.   A continuing eligibility review was initiated on 6 September 2022 in respect of the state pension (non-contributory) recipient and the case was assigned to a Social Welfare Inspector to investigate if they were permanently residing at their stated address.</p>  <p>  The Inspector returned the case to the Deciding Officer on 12 September 2022, stating they were unable to contact the customer and therefore unable to confirm their residency situation.  The Inspector's observation was that the property at the stated address appeared uninhabited.  The Inspector also tried to contact the person at the number provided and was informed by the respondent that they were not the person concerned.</p>  <p>  Based on the Inspector's report, the Deciding Officer suspended the state pension non-contributory payment and notified invalidity pension section of the Inspector&rsquo;s findings, which resulted in the suspension of that payment also. This is standard procedure in such circumstances.</p>  <p>  Where a person is experiencing financial hardship, the Community Welfare Service can facilitate urgent and in-person meetings, during business hours at over 50 Intreo Centres countrywide, including Cobh. Outside of business hours, Community Welfare Service can also facilitate an appointment within a reasonably short period, in response to a request at a mutually agreed location or the person's home. In addition, any person who needs to access the Community Welfare Service can call the recently established National CWS freephone number at 0818 60 70 80.</p>  <p>  The Department understands that one of the persons concerned visited the Cobh Intreo Centre on two separate occasions and was informed and offered a Supplementary Welfare Allowance application form, which they declined.</p>  <p>  The person concerned sent an email to state pension non-contributory section on 6 October 2022, attaching documentation indicating that they, and their partner, were residing at the stated address.  On foot of this, the Department has reactivated both payments, which are available for collection at the persons' nominated Post Office this week, together with due arrears.   </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Inspector has been requested to interview the persons concerned regarding their residency situation and will be in contact with them over in the coming days in this regard. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.</p><p>A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit payments is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such a level of care.  The person being cared for must be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and be likely to require this full-time care and attention for at least 12 months. </p><p>The Carer's Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions.  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care.  </p><p>For a first claim the Carer must have:</p><p>- 156 PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurance, and</p><p>-  39 contributions paid in the relevant tax year<b>or</b></p><p>-  39 contributions paid in the 12-month period before the start of Carer's Benefit<b>or</b></p><p>-  26 contributions paid in the relevant tax year and 26 contributions paid in the year before that.</p><p>The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which the claim for Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is made.  So, for claims made in 2022, the relevant tax year is 2020.</p><p>Only contributions at Class A, B, C, D, H and E are counted towards Carer's Benefit.  Class S (self-employed contributions) do not count.</p><p>It is payable in a single period or in separate periods for up to 2 years (104 weeks) in respect of each care recipient.  In circumstances where a person claims Carer&rsquo;s Benefit for less than six weeks in a row in any period, they must wait for a further six weeks before they can claim Carer&rsquo;s Benefit to care for the same person again.  In circumstances where the  Carer's Benefit entitlement exhausts, after the maximum 104 weeks of payment in respect of the same caree, the carer can apply for the means-tested Carer's Allowance payment. </p><p>It should be noted that not all those claiming Carer&rsquo;s Benefit opt to remain in payment for the full 104 weeks.  The Department examined this matter in and found that the average duration on Carer&rsquo;s Benefit was 76.5 weeks between 2018 and 2020.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

This ensures that people who seek a contributory pension have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it.  For those who have paid the required contributions at a reckonable rate &ndash; including Class S (self-employed) - they will be used in the calculation of their entitlements.  </p>  <p>  As we treat class 'S' paid contributions in the same way as other paid reckonable contributions e.g., class 'A' when calculating state pension contributory, my department does not currently hold a breakdown of all applications awarded or disallowed by contribution type. Therefore, the information requested by the Deputy in not available. However, if the Deputy has a particular case, he can bring it to the attention of my department who can provide further clarification.</p>  <p>  Where a person aged 66 or over does not satisfy the conditions to qualify for a state pension (contributory), or qualifies for less than the maximum rate, they may instead qualify for one the following:</p>  <p>  -  The means-tested State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC; or   </p>  <p>  -  An increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension where their spouse has a contributory pension; or</p>  <p>  -  Where their spouse/civil partner is deceased, a widow's/widower's/civil partner's contributory pension, which they may claim either based on their spouses or their own social insurance record.  The qualifying conditions for this require fewer contributions paid (260) than the State pension (contributory), and the maximum personal rate for those aged 66 is the same rate as the state pension (contributory), with allowances (notably the Living Alone Allowance) payable where applicable.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 2% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department endeavors to ensure that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible. </p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, average appeal processing times have generally improved between 2018 and 2021 from 30.0 weeks for an oral hearing in 2018 to 25.5 weeks in 2021, and from 24.8 weeks for a summary decision in 2018 to 13.9 weeks in 2021.  The figures for the period January to September 2022 were 25.4 weeks for oral hearing decisions and 15.0 weeks for summary decisions.  Further improvement in appeals processing times is a priority for the Chief Appeals Officer.  </p><p>Currently, the number of Appeals Officers (full-time equivalent) is 40 which is similar to the position over the last two years.

Given the complexity of the appeals process it can take some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.</p><p>The desire to process appeals quickly has to be balanced with the competing demand to ensure that decisions are consistent and of high quality and made in accordance with the legislative provisions and the general principles of fair procedures and natural justice.

This includes &euro;72.95 million for current funding and &euro;2.7 million in capital funds for minor works, equipment, and contributions towards playgrounds with local authorities. The year on year increase in the Budget figures is 1.6% in current, some 80% in capital, giving 2.4% overall. </p>  <p>  From 2020 to Budget 2023, current Exchequer funding for youth services and programmes increased from &euro;61.789 million to &euro;72.948 million, an 18% increase overall.</p>  <p>  I intend for the increases to the Budget 2023 allocation to focus on further investment in local and national youth organisations.  In particular the funding schemes of UBU Your Place Your Space, the Youth Services Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. </p>  <p>  In securing &euro;10 million over 2021 and 2022 I ensured that there was more than simple general increases. From 2021 on, I have secured funding for 16 new services under UBU Your Place Your Space, including a number in rural areas in Kerry, Clare, Mayo and Donegal. I have augmented the funding allocation for some 100 UBU funded organisations.  I added over &euro;1.58 million to their base funding in addition to the wider increase allocated in 2021 and 2022. This augmentation addressed cost pressures and assisted smaller organisations to increase their staffing levels. The new services and augmented allocations are secure in the current funding being provided in Budget 2023. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have initiated a reform of the Youth Service Grant Scheme and commissioning research to inform plans to modernise youth information funding. This is the first time either of these funding schemes have received such attention in many years. </p>  <p>  Consultation with key stakeholders is planned on 2023&rsquo;s Budget allocation.  My officials are examining the options for this year&rsquo;s allocation in advance of the publication of the Revised Estimates Volume.  </p>  <p>  The increased level of funding will consolidate the achievements since 2020 and provide a strong platform into the future.</p></reply>

Following this engagement it was agreed that a single additional once-off cost of living payment would be paid in respect of each child in foster care. The payment is to be made at the current foster care allowance rate of &euro;325 for a child under 12 and &euro;352 for a child over 12 and under 18, and is intended to assist in alleviating the financial pressures foster carers are currently facing.</p>  <p>  I am committed to working with Tusla on the issues raised in their Strategic Plan and in the consultations, including with foster carers, that contributed to its development.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Deputy and the Taoiseach discussed the matter of a meeting with the Irish Foster Care Association in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 5th October.  I have agreed to meet with the IFCA and the meeting will take place before the end of the month.  I will also be speaking at the IFCA Annual Conference on 5th November.</p></reply>

The importance of child-centred policies and protections represent a core value in society where children can flourish and see a brighter future. There is no doubt that we must work towards ensuring this future and empower children to voice what kind of future they want.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains firmly committed to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), a major international human rights treaty that sets out the specific rights of children. The UNCRC was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989 and Ireland ratified it in 1992.  </p>  <p>  The UNCRC has four key principles:</p>  <p>  - all the rights guaranteed by the Convention must be available to all children without discrimination of any kind (Article 2);</p>  <p>  - the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children (Article 3);</p>  <p>  - every child has the right to life, survival and development (Article 6); and</p>  <p>  - the child&rsquo;s views must be considered and taken into account in all matters affecting him or her (Article 12).</p>  <p>  The articles of the UNCRC are wide-ranging and cover a number of areas including health, housing, social security, education, leisure and play, child protection and welfare, criminal justice, international protection as well as access to information and participation in decision-making. Ireland is required to submit regular state reports on measures it has taken to progress the implementation of rights under the Convention, with the most recent report submitted in February of this year. Subsequently the State delegation has to appear before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child for an oral examination which is anticipated to take place in early 2023.</p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020, concluded at the end of 2020. Officials in my Department are currently developing a new policy framework for children and young people to cover the period from 2023 to 2028.  This new policy framework is adopting a children&rsquo;s rights approach, informed by the UN Convention on the Rights of Child, envisioning an Ireland in which the rights of children and young people are respected and realised.</p>  <p>  The holding of a Referendum on children's rights was an important commitment of the Government. As you are aware, the 31st Amendment, inserting Article 42A into the Constitution was signed into law on 28th April 2015.  The fact that the Amendment now stands as part of our Constitution represents a considerable and symbolic advance in the identification of children as individual rights holders in our country. </p></reply>

The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 provides that Tusla is independent in the performance of its functions and also places the Agency under a requirement to have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters. </p><p>Tusla is aided in its child protection role by the Children First Act 2015 which provides for a number of key child protection measures, including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect; providing for reporting and management of child protection concerns, and, improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children. The<b></b>obligations in the<b></b>Act are intended to ensure that children at risk of harm are brought to Tusla&rsquo;s attention without delay.  </p><p>The Child Care Act 1991 is the key piece of legislation whereby the State, as a last resort and for the common good, may intervene to supply the place of parents as provided for under Article 42A.2.1. If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, then Tusla must take them into care. In some cases, a parent may agree to his or her child being taken into the care of Tusla. This is called voluntary care. Tusla can also apply to the court for a number of different orders when it believes that children are at risk or in need of care. These orders give the courts a range of powers including decision-making about the type of care necessary and about access to the child or children for parents and other relatives. In such cases, the court has the power to direct Tusla regarding the care of the child.</p><p>In any child care proceedings under the 1991 Act the court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration. The Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Justice has responsibility for private family law proceedings, including separation, divorce and child custody cases and also domestic violence cases. </p><p>If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, concerns should be reported to Tusla. If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, the Garda&iacute; should be alerted without delay. If there are any concerns about Tusla&rsquo;s dealings in a particular case, Tusla should be contacted directly in the first instance.  </p></reply>

Of these, 418 (7.2%) were in Residential Care, and 15 (2.6%) were in secure Special Care. </p>  <p>  Both Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are committed to promoting safe and high quality practice in all areas of Alternative Care. This is achieved through the application of Regulations and Standards that govern the placement of children and young people.</p>  <p>  The placement of children in Residential Care is governed by the National Standards for Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres 2001, and underpinned by the Child Care (Placement in Residential Care) Regulation 1995, and the Child Care (Standards in Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres) 1996.  The placement of children in Special Care is governed by the National Standards for Special Care Units 2014, as well as the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Children in Special Care Units) Regulations 2017.</p>  <p>  HIQA carries out announced and unannounced inspections of statutory Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres and Special Care units. HIQA carry out these inspections against the identified Regulations and Standards. Tusla is the statutory regulator of Private and Voluntary Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres, and is therefore responsible for the registration and inspection of these centres in accordance with Regulations, standards, and the relevant provisions of the Child Care Act 1991.</p>  <p>  The foregoing sets out the safeguards in place with regard to all placements of children in residential and special care. Tusla in discharging its statutory responsibilities under the Child Care Acts must have the best interests of the child as its paramount consideration. It actively monitors every placement of every child in care to ensure its appropriateness to the needs of that child, and any concerns or breaches of standards or Regulations are addressed in this context.</p>  <p>  With regard to the number of children detained within Oberstown Children Detention Campus, occupancy rates since January 2022 have averaged approximately 30 on a daily basis, but the actual number on any given day can be higher. As of 12th October there were 28 children in Oberstown, 12 on remand awaiting trial and 16 serving sentences.</p>  <p>  Oberstown has developed a range of services and approaches to address the needs of young people.  This includes a focus on Care, Education, Health, challenging Offending behaviour and Preparation for leaving under what is known as the CEHOP&reg; model of care. </p>  <p>  In 2020, Oberstown adopted a new policy platform &ndash; the Children&rsquo;s Rights Policy Framework &ndash; in line with national and international standards. The Framework was developed to ensure that there is a consistent; rights based approach to the care of young people. It is against the Children&rsquo;s Rights Policy Framework that Inspectors from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) carry out independent inspections at Oberstown.</p>  <p>  Oberstown is also fully committed to the implementation of the public sector equality and human rights duty, as set out in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014.</p></reply>

This is a fundamental exercise of State sovereignty, which is necessary to protect the security of the State and to prevent illegal immigration.  </p><p>Under the Common Travel Area, Irish citizens can move freely to live, work and study in the UK on the same basis as British citizens and vice versa. There is no physical infrastructure at the border for immigration controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland, although immigration checks do occur in both jurisdictions.</p><p>Checks are conducted for a variety of reasons and, as a result, the frequency of checks varies, which can also be dependent on operational requirements. These immigration checks take place in the context of the important and close cooperation between Irish and UK authorities on immigration and security matters. All EU citizens are entitled to unrestricted free movement of travel within the EU, provided they can establish their nationality and identity.</p><p>I am informed that if a vehicle is stopped for the purpose of an immigration check, all passengers are checked for identification which must establish both their identity and nationality. In such cases where a passenger is identified as an Irish or other EU national or a UK citizen, no further action is taken.</p><p>In cases where a passenger is identified as being a non-EEA national an assessment is carried out by the Immigration Officer in respect of whether or not that person has permission to be in the State under the provisions of the Immigration Act 2004, as amended. Any non-EEA national who is visa required must have a valid Irish visa before they seek to enter the State; this includes crossing the land border.</p><p>Any visa-required national who wishes to enter the State, and remain for up to 90 days must have a Type C Short Stay Visa. A visa-required national who wishes to reside in the State for longer than 90 days must have a Type D Long Stay Visa. They must also apply for further permission to remain before their initial permission to remain expires.</p><p>Having permission to reside in the UK does not remove the legal requirement to apply for an Irish Visa in order to enter the State.</p><p>The Garda National Immigration Bureau personnel liaise with UK Immigration Enforcement on an ongoing basis to mitigate risk in order to protect and prevent abuses of the Common Travel Area.</p><p>I have been assured that, in all cases, where an Immigration Officer stops a public transport vehicle travelling from Northern Ireland, the Garda members are clearly identifiable as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and identify themselves as Immigration Officers for the purpose of carrying out the immigration check.</p><p>Racial profiling is not a feature of policing in Ireland and is not compatible with the human rights obligations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The question of ethnicity in Garda interactions with the community is one which must be considered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in light of human rights principles on consent, privacy, data protection, non-discrimination and respect for the dignity of the individual.</p><p>Furthermore, it is important that we ensure that police powers are exercised in a consistent and unbiased way and that marginalised individuals and groups are not disproportionately impacted. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers) Bill will address the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland&rsquo;s recommendation that - for the purposes of clarity and transparency - police powers of search, arrest and detention should be codified and supported by statutory codes of practice. </p><p>This is supported by relevant training to ensure members have the personal and professional expertise to proactively police Ireland's diverse community. For example since 1 April 2022 it is mandatory for all Garda Personnel, of all ranks and grades, to complete online Hate Crime training which includes a full section devoted to bias motivations.</p><p>The work of the over 350 Garda Diversity Officers is central to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's efforts to meet the needs of our diverse communities. These Garda members are trained, developed and supported to actively engage with and attend to the concerns of our minority, diverse and hard to reach communities - providing reassurance, building trust and extending the accessibility of the Garda Service.</p></reply>

Its establishment is a priority in the current Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The proposal is to formalise a new model for collaborative working within Government and place a Pathfinder unit on a statutory footing, through section 12 of the Public Service Management Act 1997. As this section has not been used before, various administrative, budgetary, governance and legal arrangements need to be developed and agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure a robust and workable model for the Pathfinder unit. </p>  <p>  The demands on both Departments during the pandemic have presented challenges to progressing the proposals. Nonetheless, the Department of Health has continued to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to develop an implementation option that fully addresses these issues. The realignment of Departmental functions in the education sector, specifically the establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, has necessitated some further consideration of the initial proposal and makeup of the Pathfinder unit.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform discussed improved proposals for governance and legal arrangements at their last meeting on this issue. Subsequently, the Department of Health has worked with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the proposals for governance and legal arrangements to advance the establishment of the unit. These draft proposals are currently being considered with participating Departments</p>  <p>  I will continue to keep this matter under close review in the context of progressing Sharing the Vision.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for medical services provided under the contract.</p>  <p>  GPs are reimbursed by the HSE for medical services provided to medical card or GP visit card holders, while patients who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis. I have no role in relation to the fees charged by individual GPs for services to private patients as they are a matter of private contract between the clinician and their patient.</p>  <p>  Progressing women&rsquo;s health is a priority for this government. Among the initiatives undertaken for the improvement of women&rsquo;s health services is the development of six specialist menopause clinics. While the majority of women who seek support for their menopause can be effectively supported by their GP, a proportion of symptomatic women will require specialist medical expertise in menopause; it is intended these more complex cases can be dealt with, upon referral by their GP, in a specialist menopause clinic.  </p>  <p>  Three specialist clinics have been opened with a fourth scheduled to be open next week. It is anticipated that the last two clinics in Cork and Galway will open before the end of this year, which will result in a total of six such clinics nationwide, one in each maternity network, for women who require complex, specialist care.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme are in the process of establishing a Professional Menopause Network which will comprise the clinical leads in this area from across the region and will include representation from the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP). The purpose of this network is to promote standardised care for women accessing the specialist clinics, but also to allow health professionals to learn from one another particularly in the implementation phase.  It is also intended that clinical teams within the specialist menopause clinic setting will provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care.</p></reply>

The establishment of a centralised function has facilitated the introduction of a standardised approach to validation of waiting lists across all hospitals and across Inpatient Day Case and Outpatient waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, the NCVU provided the attached document which outlines outpatient validation removal figures by hospital from 1st January to 7 October 2022.</p>  <p>  The NCVU has advised that patients who fail to respond to Outpatient Commissioning Offer letters are now formally validated by the validation team and removals relating to this cohort of patients are included in the attached report.</p>  <p><a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-10-13_pq388-13-11-22_en.xlsx">OPD Validation</a></p></reply>

In line with the Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a medicine added to the formal Reimbursement list. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The Reimbursement list is the same for the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme and the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS).</p>  <p>  The HSE advise that while HRT is used as a treatment for menopause, there are also a wide range of other HRT treatments in place across multiple clinical areas, including the replacement of cortisone in Addison&rsquo;s disease, and the replacement of thyroxine in thyroid disease, etc. In addition, menopause can present differently for individual women, both in symptom severity and duration. Not all women experiencing menopause may be clinically eligible for HRT, which is prescription based. Women may also choose not to take HRT and to address their symptoms through alternative therapies and/or lifestyle changes.</p>  <p>  The HSE do currently operate two schemes which offer financial assistance to people in receipt of prescribed HRT medication on the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  These HRT medications are available to medical card holders, subject to the statutory prescription charge. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card under the GMS scheme is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Under the DPS, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines, which includes some HRT medications.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the provision of HRT under the statutory schemes cost &euro;6.3m, comprised of &euro;4.5m under the GMS scheme and &euro;1.8m under the DPS. The HSE do not have access to data on the expenditure of patients receiving products privately in community pharmacies or whose expenditure for medicines falls below the threshold of the Drug Payment Scheme. This prevents the HSE from giving a robust estimation of the costs of providing HRT free to all who may need it to treat symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. </p>  <p>  However, the HSE have estimated that the additional minimum cost to the state of providing HRT free to all who may need it clinically would likely be &euro;4m per annum. Therefore, the total would be in excess of &euro;10m per annum. This estimation does not take account of any associated loss of prescription charge income, any relevant future demographic changes, or how the introduction of free provision could impact on uptake.</p>  <p>  As announced in Budget 2023, the VAT rate for non-oral forms of HRT, will be reduced to zero from 1 January 2023, thus reducing the cost of HRT for all those who need it.</p>  <p>  Finally, individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

As of Friday 30th of September, 85,463 eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 38,287 staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 123,750 .</p><p>The HSE and the Department have been examining progressing the rollout of the Pandemic Recognition Payment to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p> <blockquote> 	1.Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<br /><br />2.Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<br /><br />3.Agency roles working in the HSE;<br /><br />4.Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;<br /><br />5.Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; <br /><br />6.Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.  </blockquote>  <p>The above 6 areas only are covered by this Government Decision and all eligible workers will be paid in accordance with the overarching eligibility criteria in place.  </p><p>As the rollout of payments to the eligible workers in non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisations has not yet begun, and eligibility has not yet been assessed across the private sector, I cannot provide an estimated number of workers who will receive the payment.

My officials are kept in full brief on these issues through engagements with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and EU fora and my department is working via these fora in considering and addressing these challenges and working towards the effective implementation of the regulations, ensuring that healthcare systems and patients have access to safe medical devices.  My Department is fully committed to continuing to work with key stakeholders in this regard, in identifying and reaching pragmatic and necessary solutions to these challenges.</p><p>It remains imperative that we continue to work collectively across the EU in identifying harmonized solutions to these challenges in order to ensure that the new regulatory system is effective in practice and delivers on its objectives.  </p><p>The full and effective implementation of these important regulations remains a key priority for my Department and I. We will continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders to address and overcome the challenges faced with the overall objective of ensuring that the benefits of these regulations are ultimately achieved in practice.</p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.  The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  The Drug Payment Scheme (DPS) ensures that no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines who are not eligible for a medical card. </p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant.  Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection administer the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme and the Fuel allowance, which may assist individuals with the costs associated with operating a home dialysis machine. Further information on these can be found at: </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/collection/d5554-supplementary-welfare-allowance/</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/service/00aa38-fuel-allowance/ </p>  <p>  Finally, as announced in Budget 2023, every household in Ireland will receive three &euro;200 energy credits, totalling &euro;600, towards the costs of their electricity over the coming months.</p></reply>
