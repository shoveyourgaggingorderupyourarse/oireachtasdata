The Agencies may retain and expend the ORI that they generate on pursuing their mandates subject to the limits sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>A request to allow the Agencies concerned to retain and expend Own Resource Income generated in 2022 is currently under consideration by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Accordingly, I am not in a position at this stage to confirm what the sanctioned levels of ORI will be in 2022. I would expect, however, that the 2022 levels will be consistent with the levels sanctioned in 2021. In terms of 2023, the permitted levels of ORI will not be considered until the beginning of next year. It is also envisaged that they too will be consistent with the 2021 levels.</p><p>The attached table below provides the Deputy with the sanctioned levels of ORI for the Agencies concerned for 2021.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Agency </th>       <th>Own Resources Income (&euro;m)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland</td>       <td>94.506 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IDA Ireland</td>       <td>25.684 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Standards Authority of Ireland</td>       <td>27.200 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Offices</td>       <td>1.300 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Health and Safety Authority</td>       <td>4.000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>152.690 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition to the foregoing, a number of the Department&rsquo;s Agencies, the Irish Auditing &amp;amp; Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) and the Competition &amp;amp; Consumer Protection Commission and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), impose and receive levies to assist them in carrying some or all of their functions. These levies are determined in accordance with the terms of the relevant governing legislation and are intended to cover the costs of regulation.</p></reply>

The Climate Planning Fund for Business is therefore available to all Enterprise Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta clients and potential clients, with certain programmes such as the GreenStart also available through the Local Enterprise Offices, which support all businesses with less than 10 employees. </p>  <p>  The Enterprise Emissions Reduction Investment Fund provides grant aid to reduce the payback period on carbon reducing technologies in manufacturing processes, and is designed very specifically to achieve a core measure in the enterprise chapter of the Climate Action Plan 2021 to &ldquo;accelerate the uptake of carbon-neutral heating in industry&rdquo;. It is therefore targeted only at manufacturing businesses, the vast majority of which are, or are eligible to be, clients of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. The Enterprise Emissions Reduction Investment Fund will provide manufacturing businesses the foundations they require to begin their transition to low carbon production processes and assist them to invest in carbon abating capital equipment and technologies.</p>  <p>  To help all businesses get started on the transition to a low carbon economy, my Department, with Minister Ryan's Department, launched the Climate Toolkit 4 Business last year, which can assist all SMEs and microenterprises. The Toolkit provides an estimate of the carbon footprint of the business based on some simple information input and generates a tailored action plan and highlights relevant state programmes and funding that can assist in implementing the recommended actions. These actions will be in the areas of energy use, water use, materials use and transport. By implementing them, businesses will be well on their way to a greener future. I would encourage all enterprises that do not qualify for the Green Transition Fund to engage with the Climate Toolkit for Business as it will help them get started on their low carbon journey.</p>  <p>  Our Local Enterprise Offices recently re-launched the &ldquo;Green4Micro&rdquo; programme. This programme offers green transition advice and technical support to micro-enterprises. The Green for Micro programme is open to all micro-enterprises, and not just agency clients, with up to ten employees. This programme is particularly suited to businesses in construction and the built environment, retail, manufacturing, textiles and fashion, food, electronics, plastics, and packaging. Qualifying SMEs receive two days of intensive mentoring, including a sustainability audit, and design an action plan to reduce their carbon footprint. With climate change, changing regulations, rising resource costs and changing customer expectations adopting an eco-friendlier approach is the best way forward for business.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-22a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062200060#WRA01400"><p>At the outset, I should clarify that there is no restriction under company law on residents of Northern Ireland either establishing or being directors of Irish registered companies. There is a requirement, as per Section 137 of the Companies Act 2014, that a company on the register of companies must have at least one EEA resident director. As an alternative, a company can either put a bond in place pursuant to Section 137(2) of the Companies Act 2014, or obtain a certificate, in accordance with Section 140, from the Registrar of Companies certifying that the company has a real and continuous link with one or more economic activities that are being carried on in the State.</p>  <p>  As a consequence of the UK leaving the European Union, and the ending of the transition period on 31st December 2020, with effect from 1st January 2021, UK (including Northern Ireland) resident directors of companies registered in Ireland are not considered resident in the EEA for the purposes of Section 137. Companies that previously relied on having a UK (including Northern Ireland) resident director to meet the requirements of Section 137 are required to either appoint an EEA resident director or else pursue one of the alternative options. </p>  <p>  I understand that the number of companies previously relying on UK resident directors to fulfil the EEA resident requirement is not readily available. However, I have been informed by the Companies Registration Office that in the region of 3,000 bonds have been received since 1 January 2021 in relation to the EEA residency requirement. In addition, 979 certificates have been issued. In the circumstances, there are no plans to amend Section 137 to alter the requirements relating to EEA resident directors.</p></reply>

The credit of &euro;176.22 (excluding VAT) is being applied to all domestic electricity accounts through April, May and June, and includes prepay meters.The payment is being applied to domestic electricity accounts i.e. those which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2), as set out in section 1 of the Act.</p><p>As of 27 May 2022, 2,129,832 domestic electricity customers have been credited, with 1,845,142 of these customers having been notified via a line item on their bill or prepayment vend receipt. This means 99% of all eligible customers have now had the credit applied to their account.</p><p>The majority of residential tenants will hold their own domestic electricity accounts, and therefore receive the credit directly. In other cases there may be tenancy agreements in place where tenants pay their actual share of each bill, and, in those cases, will benefit from the payment because the amount of the bill will be reduced by the amount of the credit.  </p><p>A small proportion may have other arrangements in place whereby electricity costs are part of the rental cost. In cases where the households  are in rental accommodation, where tenants have disputes relating to tenancies including any terms relating to electricity payments, these can be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for dispute resolution.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that Frequently Asked Questions on the electricity credit, which include the matter raised here, are available on gov.ie at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/4ae14-electricity-costs-emergency-benefit-scheme/.</p></reply>

This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p><p>A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network.</p><p>These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 58,000 at the end of April.</p><p>In addition, the Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is available online.</p><p>In line with the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to support the transition to EVs:  </p><p>-  The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland has been retained until at least end-2022. Work is ongoing to identify additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil-fuelled vehicles. Overall, cost-effective, targeted policy supports will continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years</p><p>-  Work is under way to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI), as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure.  </p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy - including grants - is kept under continuous review with the objective of making low-emission vehicles affordable.</p></reply>

This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfigured to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services.</p>  <p>  Due to the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X20 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X20 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route.</p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the Authority for reply.

The incentive offers a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (S447C TCA).</p>  <p>  Applicants for HTB must be first-time purchasers, a term defined in S447C TCA as follows:</p>  <p>  "'first-time purchaser' means an individual who, at the time of a claim under subsection (3) has not, either individually or jointly with any other person, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling;"</p>  <p>  The intention behind this policy is to target the HTB scheme to help those who have not had the opportunity to build up equity in another property which could be used to purchase a second or subsequent property. </p>  <p>  Although it should be noted that the Central Bank of Ireland is independent in the formulation of its policies, the definition of first-time purchaser under HTB complements that in the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules. This includes circumstances where there is more than one person involved in the purchase or building of a new home. Under the Central Bank&rsquo;s rules, where the borrower of a housing loan is more than one person and one or more of those persons has availed of a housing loan previously then none of those persons is considered a first-time buyer.</p>  <p>  As such, I do not intend to amend the definition of first-time purchaser for the purposes of the HTB scheme to specifically include separated and divorced persons who have previously owned a home.  Also of relevance is that a formal review of the HTB scheme is currently underway and is expected to be completed shortly.  The intention is that the exercise will help inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022, having regard to the sound management of the public finances.  While decisions in relation to HTB in 2023 have yet to be taken, I do not expect my position in relation to the definition of first-time purchaser to alter. </p></reply>

In general, the Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within Annex III of the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates of VAT. Ireland currently operates two reduced rates of VAT, 13.5% and 9%, as permitted by the Directive. </p>  <p>  Building materials are not included in the categories of goods and services on which the EU Directive allows a lower rate of VAT or an exemption to be applied, and so they are liable to VAT at the standard rate. By way of special derogation from the general rule though, Ireland is permitted to continue its long-standing practice of applying a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to the supply of ready-to-pour concrete and certain concrete blocks but there are strict restrictions on this derogation, including that the rate cannot be reduced below 12%.  </p>  <p>  Under the EU VAT Directive the supply of construction services is liable to VAT at the standard rate generally across the EU but Ireland applies a 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to all construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive, again subject to strict restrictions. </p>  <p>  Construction services that consist of the &ldquo;renovation and repairing of private dwellings, excluding material which account for a significant part of the value of the service supplied&rdquo; can benefit from the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%. This means that where a building contractor carries out home improvements and the material cost does not exceed two-thirds of the costs of the improvements then the reduced rate of 13.5% applies to the total construction service. A consequences of this is that a VAT registered building contractor will generally be entitled to recover VAT at the standard rate on most building materials purchased while the contractor is only liable to change VAT at the 13.5% reduced rate on the total supply (including the materials and labour elements of the job) to the homeowner. The difference in rates between the 23% input VAT and the 13.5% output VAT should normally be reflected in the VAT inclusive costs to the homeowner. </p></reply>

I published Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap (2018 and 2021 update) to set out our commitments made and the significant, concrete actions we have taken in response. My Department facilitates extensive engagement with stakeholders in advance of new legislative measures being introduced and this collaborative, transparent process provides certainty to businesses situated here and those considering investing.</p>  <p>  Of course, Ireland is still a small open economy and certain risks exist in relation to corporation tax. In relation to concentration risk, the latest data show that around &euro;1 in every &euro;8 of overall tax revenues collected arises from just 10 large corporate tax payers.  This concentration means total tax receipts are vulnerable to the business decisions of a handful of large companies, albeit that many of those have had a significant presence in Ireland for decades. While the strong growth in corporation tax over the last several years is, in many respects, welcome and a reflection of the success of our industrial policy in attracting high quality multinational firms and high wage jobs to Ireland, we must be careful not to craft long-term budgetary policies on the basis of these volatile and unpredictable corporate tax receipts.  As a result, the Government has frequently cautioned against building permanent expenditure commitments on the basis of corporation tax receipts.  </p>  <p>  Proposed changes to the international tax regime from the OECD agreement also represent a risk to the CT revenue stream. My Department&rsquo;s central estimate at present is that c.&euro;2 billion could be lost in corporate tax by 2025 relative to baseline. I would stress that there is significant uncertainty attached to this technical assumption; the final figure could be considerably different. However it is my view that the benefits of current OECD and EU tax reforms outweigh the negatives. The reforms achieve a fine balance that will provide the certainty and stability required by businesses here for future economic growth and employment creation.  </p>  <p>  The government has taken actions to address the risks associated with the concentration and volatility of CT receipts, including prioritising the reduction of debt and continuing to broaden the tax base.  Finally, last year I established the Commission on Taxation and Welfare to analyse the structure of our public finances and to propose reforms to ensure the long-term sustainability of our tax and welfare systems. The Commission is due to report next month on how to best address vulnerabilities in the tax base to ensure that we are in a position of strength to address any future economic shocks that may occur.</p></reply>

From 1 July 2022, Special Leave with Pay for COVID-19 will continue to be available for the stated self-isolation period, which is currently 7 days. This is in keeping with the rationale of assisting in the prevention of the possible onward spread of COVID-19 in the work premises. </p>  <p>  I would also point out that the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations were introduced in 2014. It was a significant reform development that standardised and simplified paid sick leave arrangements across all sectors of the Public Service. All illnesses are treated equally under the Public Service Sick Leave Regulations and equity is a fundamental part of the Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Sick Leave scheme provides for the payment of the following to staff during periods of absence from work due to illness or injury:</p>  <p>  -  A maximum of 92 days on full pay in a rolling one year period </p>  <p>  -  Followed by a maximum of 91 days on half pay in a rolling one year period </p>  <p>  -  Subject to a maximum of 183 days paid sick leave in a rolling four year period </p>  <p>  There is the potential for access to additional sick leave in certain circumstances as guided by the Critical Illness Protocol. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of Health are working on a proposal to deal with certain "long COVID" cases in the health sector and my officials will examine any proposals as soon as they are finalised. </p></reply>

Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. In January 2022 my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focused on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p>  <p>  -  One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this</p>  <p>  category;</p>  <p>  -  Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and</p>  <p>  -  Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs.</p>  <p>  Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  In April 2022, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this  circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are: (i) in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter; (ii) are in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and (iii) can be completed during 2022. The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. It is a matter for individual local authorities to identify suitable acquisitions in line with local circumstances and their social housing allocations policy. </p>  <p>  The prevention of homelessness occurring in the first instance is very much a priority for my Department. The National Homeless Action Committee, which I chair, was established in Q4 2021 in line with the commitment set out in Housing for All. At the first meeting of the Committee, it was agreed that immediate priority would be given to additional measures to prevent homelessness. A number of measures have been identified and are now being advanced. Three separate subgroups have also been established to focus on specific areas of homelessness prevention. One of these subgroups is focused on considering enhanced family support and prevention services for children and their families. Progress on these measures will be reported on at the next meeting of NHAC, due to take place in July. I am committed to ensuring that families are not made homeless under any circumstances, and will continue to work with all our key partners to deliver solutions. </p></reply>

MARA's role will be wide ranging in scope and extensive preparatory work is required in advance of its establishment in respect of each of its individual functions. It is intended that MARA will be formally established in Q1 2023. </p>  <p>  To lead this critical work in a focussed way, and to manage the timely establishment of the agency, a dedicated MARA Establishment Unit is in place within my Department. This unit is in the process of expanding to 11 staff who will then move for a period of secondment to MARA as an &lsquo;advance team&rsquo;, so that there will continuity of the work. A budget of &euro;2 million is available this year to allow early investment in the structuring of the new agency. </p>  <p>  I expect the recruitment campaign for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairperson and ordinary members of the Board of MARA to be underway in the coming weeks. In respect of the Board, it is my intention to seek nominees from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and the County and City Management Association at the same time the campaign for Chair and ordinary members is publicly advertised.  It is intended that the Board will be in place later this year in advance of the established of MARA.</p>  <p>  The functions of MARA will be commenced on a phased basis, starting with the consenting processes. My Department will continue to accept and assess applications for foreshore consents under the existing Foreshore Acts until MARA is operational. Once MARA is operational, new applications will not be accepted under the current Foreshore consenting regime, but applications on hand (e.g. site investigation applications etc.) will be processed to completion. </p></reply>

In order to progress matters a meeting was held on 4 November 2021 between officials from my Department and Sligo County Council to review issues which require further elaboration in order to evidentially support an extension of the defective concrete blocks grant scheme to County Sligo. </p>  <p>  Sligo County Council undertook to review their submission in light of the discussion which took place and address the gaps in evidential data which have been identified by my Department. In that regard, the relevant local authority are to continue to take the lead, build on the good work to date and demonstrate damage which has been documented has manifested due to the presence of reactive pyrite, which is a crucial burden of proof if the scheme is to be extended to include Sligo. </p>  <p>  My Department is eager to progress this matter and to that end, issued a correspondence to Sligo County Council on 8 March 2022 outlining formally the nature of clarifications sought. A follow up meeting in this regard was held with the local authority on the 24 March, 2022.  A further submission is awaited from Sligo County Council on the matter and my Department will deal promptly with any such submission.  </p>  <p>  The extension of the scheme to other local authority areas was considered as part of wider deliberations on the Scheme by Government. I, as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, may, with Government approval, extend the scheme to additional counties, where the evidence supports such an extension and I have recently made such a recommendation to Government with respect to Clare and Limerick.</p></reply>

At the end of 2021, over 100,000 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were more than 61,900 households actively in receipt of HAP support.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It is a matter for each local authority to determine whether the application of a discretionary increase is warranted, and the level of such an increase, on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, my Department was tasked to undertake an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of the 20% discretion available to local authorities under the HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support.</p>  <p>  Following this analysis, I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the HAP discretion rate to 35% and, for new tenancies, to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons where required. Further details will be available when the engagement process is complete. These changes will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.</p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for community/educational/religious buildings and apartments. </p>  <p>  The draft regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The draft regulations have also been screened for Appropriate Assessment (AA) under the Habitats Directive by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit (EAU) and the need for AA has been screened out. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the draft solar regulations as part of the SEA process was launched on 15 June 2022. The consultation will run until 13 July 2022.  Further information in relation to the consultation, including the full suite of documentation such as the SEA Environmental Report and details regarding how to make a submission, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at the following: www.gov.ie/en/consultation/3813e-public-consultation-on-the-draft-planning-and-development-act-2000-exempted-development-no-3-regulations-2022-and-the-draft-planning-and-development-solar-safeguarding-zone-regulations-2022-solar-exemptions/. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before the finalisation of the draft regulations. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. Accordingly, the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming months.</p></reply>

The number of construction workers involved in residential construction will need to rise to 67,500 by the middle of the decade to achieve an annual average delivery of 33,000 homes.</p><p>This will be achieved through a variety of means, including up-to-date forecast of labour demand and supply for the construction sector, and implementing measures necessary to fast-track sufficient numbers into the residential construction workforce. This includes, but is not limited to an integrated education, training and activation response, including delivery of new courses and apprenticeships, working with industry stakeholders, through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-led Construction Sector Group, to review and promote the attractiveness of careers in the construction sector, recourse to international labour markets where supply is unavailable locally, including facilitating recruitment from abroad and changes to employment permit schemes where necessary, and encouraging participation in the Irish market by international construction firms and builders. </p><p>As a whole of Government approach has been adopted to the delivery of Housing for All, primary responsibility for the above measures falls to my colleagues, the Ministers for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, respectively. Delivery of these measures is being monitored on an ongoing basis by the Housing for All Industry Capability Workstream. </p><p>It should be noted that Housing for All progress reports are published on a quarterly basis. The fourth of these reports, covering progress in Q2 2022 is due for publication in July.

The aim of this Strategy is to help people who are aged 18-24 and who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. This Strategy, through extensive consultation with key stakeholders including service providers and young people who are experiencing homelessness, aims to examine the causes and experience of homelessness among young people with a view to putting in place strategic interventions to prevent entry to homelessness as well as tailoring services and supports to improve the experience of young people in homelessness and to assist them to successfully exit homelessness. </p><p>It is clear that the Strategy requires an integrated, whole-of-Government approach, with a multitude of key stakeholders playing a vital role in addressing the fundamental issues arising in addressing youth homelessness. </p><p>The specific actions of the Strategy are in the process of being finalised with a view to publishing the Strategy in September 2022.

Local authorities, including Cork City Council and Cork County Council, submitted their initial Plans to me last December.  Both Cork City Council and Cork County Council submitted revised Delivery Action Plans to my Department in May 2022. Preparation of the Plans allowed each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly. I expect that all revised Plans will be ready for publication shortly. They will provide a comprehensive national overview of projected delivery of affordable housing.</p><p>Funding is made available by Government to assist local authority and Approved Housing Body delivery of affordable housing, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), previously known as the Serviced Sites Fund, and the Cost Rental Equity Loan.</p><p>Cork City Council submitted two projects to my Department under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) scheme in the 1<sup>st</sup>SSF call in 2018: Boherboy Road which will assist in the delivery of 117 affordable purchase homes and Churchfield Road which will assist in the delivery of 21 affordable purchase homes. The first two phases of the development at Boherboy Road involving 37 homes will be delivered this year and Cork City Council has advised my Department that this scheme will be advertised for applications to purchase in July.  Cork City Council has advised my Department that construction will commence on the Churchfield Road project in 2023.</p><p>Cork City Council have also confirmed that they will deliver a further 36 affordable homes this year at Cluain Chaoin in Tower in two phases via an advance purchase arrangement.  I understand that the Scheme of Priority in respect of Phase 1 of this development is to be presented to Cork City Council on Monday 11th July 2022 and, if adopted, the scheme will be advertised in July.</p><p>These projects were measured against agreed eligibility criteria and received approval in principle based on the supporting information submitted. A copy of the AHF funding eligibility criteria is attached for the Deputy's information.</p></reply>

The Office of Government (OGP) is responsible for implementing national policy on public procurement, particularly in relation to construction procurement.</p><p>In January, the OGP introduced the following interim measures to address the impact that the recent price increases in construction materials is having on public works tenders:</p><p>-  Reduced fixed price period duration to 24 months (previously 30 months minimum).</p><p>-  Permit mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period for material price changes in excess of 15% (previously 50%).</p><p>-  Introduction of a new mechanism to address the period between tender submission and award through limited indexation of the tender price.</p><p>The above measures related to new Public Works Contracts going forward (contracts with a version date earlier than 7th January 2022).</p><p>More recently, in the interest of safeguarding public projects that are already under construction and to mitigate the risks of significant losses being sustained by contractors, the OGP has introduced an &lsquo;Inflation/Supply Chain Delay Co-operation Framework&rsquo; for parties engaged under a public works contract. This framework will operate on an ex-gratia basis and includes measures to: </p><p>-  address delay to the Substantial Completion of the Works, or a Section of the Works, that has occurred since 01 January 2022 where the delay is caused by supply chain disruption </p><p>-  address recent inflation in the prices of fuel and energy </p><p>-  address inflation in materials, from 01 January 2022 onwards for those Public Works Contracts with a version date earlier than 7th January 2022 </p><p>-  proactively, and collaboratively, manage the on-going impact of these external factors insofar as is possible within the project&rsquo;s original delivery parameters</p><p>My own Department is collaborating in a broad range of measures to mitigate inflation in construction. These include the Construction Technology Centre, whose role will be enhanced for its first three years of operation to prioritise residential construction. Its rollout will be complemented by an increased focus for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-led Construction Sector Group (CSG) on the residential construction sector.</p><p>To further support innovation the development of Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) will be broadened, and will include the establishment of a national Centre of Excellence Demonstration Park for MMC.</p><p>My Department is also in the process of preparing a study to carry out an analysis for each component of cost of construction (including cost of compliance) of house and apartment development, with a view to reducing cost and increasing standardisation. It will also identify opportunities for cost reduction for consideration by relevant Government Departments and industry. </p><p>In summary therefore, my Department is vigorously engaged in, and collaborating in strategies that will support local authorities in their crucially important work, and residential construction in general, in counteracting the effects of construction inflation. </p></reply>

The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of local authorities, including through the important role of vacant homes officers, to ensure a dedicated focus on tackling vacancy and dereliction with a view to increasing the opportunities for residential development.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have been requested to arrange for the vacant homes officer position to become full-time by the end of Q2 2022 and to notify my Department accordingly. I expect that each local authority will have at least one full-time vacant homes officer working in their local authority. Local authorities are continuing with the process of the delivery of the Vacant Homes Officer position on a full-time basis. As this process is ongoing, I will have a full position from local authorities following the delivery timeframe of the end of June.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-22a.181.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062200063#WRD04200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 to 64, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003. My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management manages fire service issues in my Department. </p>  <p>  Fire services in Ireland are provided by the local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, 31 authorities provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide deliver local authority fire services, 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector. </p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms/ standards established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.  The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, 'Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.  </p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach, which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires that occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.  </p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;Retained&rsquo; fire services delivery. This review will have a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association.  </p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues that are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options that will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future.  </p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review is the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and engaged the services of an independent consultant to survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. In preparing the survey, the project team sought the views of retained services trade union representatives through the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group.  </p>  <p>  That feedback in conjunction with consultation at appropriate stages with all key stakeholders during the review process, including Local Government, fire service management/staff, and the staffing interest groups will form the basis of the final review report. It is the expectation of the project team that the final review report will be submitted to the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management before the end of the year.  At that time, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management will make a determination on the publication of the report. </p>  <p>  Following the delivery of the Retained Fire services review report, any recommendations made to National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management&rsquo;s Board, to address the issues raised in relation to the recruitment and retention of Retained Firefighters, will need to be considered with stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  In regards to retained fire stations that were unable to deploy appliances or crews on foot of an emergency call due to manning levels. Detailed data on the interruption of service at individual stations, whether due to staffing, unavailability of appliances, crew engagement in training or for other reasons, is not collected by, and consequently is not available in, my Department. The relevant information may be available from individual local authorities. </p>  <p>  The Fire Service operate a pre-determined attendance model, enabling very high levels of resilience within the Fire Service. This enabled full service delivery throughout the Covid-19 public health emergency, with next nearest stations being deployed immediately in any situation where a station was unavailable. </p></reply>

FBR staff have since processed 7,000 FBR applications while also continuing to provide support to passport services due to the unprecedented levels of passport demand.</p>  <p>  The FBR Service provides an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has been scaling up resources to deal with anticipated demand for passports and FBRs since June of last year. A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway since 2021. In addition, the Passport Service has run its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs).  The Department has also been working with the HSE to provide opportunities to contact tracing staff to transfer to the Passport Service. As of 20 June, these staff have begun to be assigned to the Customer Service Hub, which will further increase the number of staff answering customer queries. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers at the Passport Service to over 900 which represents double the number of staff with the Passport Service in June of last year.</p>  <p>  The unprecedented level of staff currently working in the Passport Service will be maintained in the months ahead. This will allow for the reassignment of additional staff to the processing of FBR applications with the aim of significantly reducing turnaround times for these applications by the end of this year.</p></reply>

Ireland is actively engaged on Myanmar in our role as an elected member of the Security Council, including by calling on the military and all parties for an urgent end to violence, full respect for human rights and compliance with international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law. At a private meeting of the United Nations Security Council on 27 May, the 9th such meeting since the crisis began, Ireland reiterated our grave concern at the situation, particularly violence against civilians and the ongoing brutality of the Tatmadaw. Ireland will continue to call for regular discussions at the Security Council on Myanmar. We also support the role of regional partners including ASEAN, ASEAN&rsquo;s Special Envoy and the Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary General, and we urge the prompt implementation of ASEAN&rsquo;s five-point consensus</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s practice is to recognise states and not governments. We do not therefore recognise specific governments in Myanmar or elsewhere.</p>  <p>  Reflecting our core values, Ireland is committed to promoting a fair, just and more secure world. In contexts of conflict, we underline the importance of inclusion and engagement of key stakeholders in negotiating acceptable and sustainable solutions. Ireland acknowledges the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and the National Unity Government (NUG) as important stakeholders in Myanmar&rsquo;s future, and encourages their involvement in discussions and negotiations to resolve the current crisis. Ireland has engaged with the NUG at official level from Ireland, through our Embassies in Bangkok and London, and via the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York. </p>  <p>  Ireland stands with the people of Myanmar and will continue to work actively within the European Union, the United Nations, including through membership of the United Nations Security Council to support the people of Myanmar.  We reiterate that the democratic will of the people must be respected and call for the immediate restoration of legitimate, civilian government.</p></reply>

I am gravely concerned by the passing of death sentences on a number of those arrested for peaceful protest and support for democracy in Myanmar.  I understand that 114 people have been sentenced to death, primarily by military courts, without the possibility of appeal.  On 13 June, Ireland addressed this issue at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly with the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy for Myanmar, expressing our abhorrence at this action, and reiterating our call for the immediate release of all political prisoners and all those arbitrarily detained in Myanmar. The EU also spoke at that session, calling on the Myanmar <i>de facto</i>authorities to apply the moratorium on executions observed since 1988. In particular, the EU called on the<i>de facto</i>Myanmar authorities not to carry out the death sentences announced last week, to which the Deputy is referring. At a private meeting of the United Nations Security Council on 27 May, Ireland reiterated our grave concern at the deteriorating security, human rights and humanitarian situation in Myanmar, particularly violence against civilians and the ongoing brutality of the Tatmadaw. </p><p>As I have outlined in my previous statements on this matter, the election results of November 2020 and the sustained, large-scale popular opposition to the coup since 1 February demonstrate that the military have no mandate to govern Myanmar. The people of Myanmar have been resolute in rejecting the military coup. General Min Aung Hlaing&rsquo;s self-appointment as Prime Minister is a clear attempt to normalise his position and does not reflect the democratic will of the people of Myanmar. Ireland has had no engagement or bilateral meeting with the Myanmar military.</p><p>We will continue to work with our partners in the EU, in the region, and in the context of our United Nations Security Council membership to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis, to consider further actions to restore the democratic path in Myanmar, and to protect the people of Myanmar.</p></reply>

Over 623,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022. This is 105,000 more passports than were issued at this point of the year in 2019. In the past four weeks, the Passport Service has issued an average of 30,000 passports per week.</p><p>99% of all child and adult online renewal applications are issued within the standard turnaround time and almost half of all adults who renew their passports online will receive their new passport in the post within 2 working days.</p><p>Processing time for first time applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In the space of three months, processing time for first-time applications has been reduced by almost 40%.</p><p>My Department has been proactively planning for this significant increase in demand for many months and have made an unprecedented investment in the staffing and resources necessary to meet this demand.</p><p>A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway since 2021. In addition, the Passport Service has run its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs).  The Department has also been working with the HSE to provide opportunities to contact tracing staff to transfer to the Passport Service. As of 20 June, these staff have begun to be assigned to the Customer Service Hub, which will further increase the number of staff answering customer queries. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers at the Passport Service to over 900 which represents double the number of staff with the Passport Service in June of last year.</p><p>Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.</p><p>Over the past number of weeks the Passport Service has worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified.

In this context, we will need to have a mature debate about our broader approach to security and defence issues in Ireland, including opportunities for cooperation and collaboration at EU level.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has indicated that the issues involved could potentially be discussed through a Citizens' Assembly or a similar framework. A specific timeframe has not been considered, but the Taoiseach has noted that this could happen during the lifetime of the current Government.  For now, the Government's focus remains on tackling the impact of Russia's war on Ukraine, in particular in terms of assisting the Ukrainian people and holding Russia's leadership to account.  </p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality remains an important strand of our foreign policy and is coherent with our active approach to peace support operations, crisis management, conflict resolution, and peacebuilding.  The government has no plans to alter this policy or to apply for NATO membership. </p>  <p>  We do however recognise the importance of enhanced cooperation between the EU and NATO, particularly where it benefits international peace and security and is focussed on avoiding duplication of structures, systems and interoperability standards, and where it adds clear value in areas such as efforts to combat cyber or hybrid threats. </p></reply>

A Career Break is a period of unpaid special leave for not less than 1 school year. It may be extended on an annual basis provided the total period of the Career Break does not exceed 5 years at any one time, subject to an overall maximum of 10 years absence during a teacher&rsquo;s career.</p>  <p>  Under the Career Break Scheme, a teacher may not be employed in an approved teaching or special needs assistant post funded by monies provided by the Oireachtas.  However, in exceptional circumstances, an employer may appoint a qualified teacher on Career Break for substitute teaching purposes subject to a maximum of (a) 90 days in a school year at primary level and (b) 300 hours in a school year at post primary level.</p>  <p>  The aforementioned substitute teaching restrictions were suspended in the 2021/22 school year and previous school years in response to issues raised in relation to teacher supply. Information Note TC 0015/2021 titled &rsquo;Temporary changes to the Career Break Scheme for Registered Teachers employed in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools-2021/22  School Year&rsquo; published in June 2021, informed employers and teachers of the temporary change to the Career Break Scheme for the 2021/22 school year.  As stated in the Information Note, this is a temporary change and will cease at the end of the 2021/2022 school year.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0038/2022 titled &lsquo;Coronavirus (COVID-19): Updated Working Arrangements for Teachers and Special Needs Assistants employed in recognised Primary and Post Primary schools&rsquo; paragraph 6.1.1 (b) states the normal terms and conditions of the Career Break Scheme will apply for the 2022/23 school year as follows: </p>  <p>  (b) Career Break Scheme for teachers </p>  <p>  The temporary arrangement to the Career Break Scheme under Information Note TC 0015/2021, permitting a teacher on Career Break to carry out unlimited substitute work, will cease at the end of the 2021/22 school year. Therefore, the normal terms and conditions of the Career Break Scheme (paragraph 8) under Circular 54/2019 will apply for the 2022/23 school year where limited substitute work is permitted.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform determines the terms and conditions of the Career Break Scheme for public servants, which includes teachers.</p>  <p>  Under Section 24 of the Education Act 1998, the Minister for Education, with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is authorised to determine the terms and conditions of employment for teachers employed in approved teaching posts funded by monies provided by the Oireachtas. The Teachers Conciliation Council (TCC) forms part of the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers, the purpose of which is to provide a forum for claims and proposals relating to the salary, and other terms &amp;amp; conditions of service for teachers. The Council is comprised of representatives from the Teacher Unions, the School Management Bodies, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Education. The TCC is independently chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission. The terms and conditions of teachers employed in State funded teaching posts are formulated at TCC and are of general application to all teachers appointed to such posts. The Career Break Scheme exists by virtue of a collective agreement, concluded under the auspices of the TCC. </p>  <p>  My Department will keep the position under review in the 2022/23 school year, having regard to the recruitment of substitute teachers.</p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of teachers granted Career Break for the 2022/23 school year is currently not available in my Department.</p></reply>

The assisted living scheme is separate from these supports and does not fall under the remit of my Department.</p><p>Disability Allowance is the Department&rsquo;s main income support for people who have a disability. To be eligible, the disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the person must be aged between 16 and 66 years of age. The allowance is also subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency requirement.</p><p>People receiving Disability Allowance may also be eligible for secondary benefits such as free travel, fuel allowance, the household benefits package, the living alone allowance and the telephone support allowance.</p><p>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant are the main income supports provided by my Department to carers in the community. Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who require full-time care and attention. Carers may also, subject to certain conditions, qualify for the household benefits package and a free travel pass. </p><p>In acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society and the challenges faced by those with disabilities I introduced a number of measures as part of Budget 2022 in relation to supports provided by my Department. These include:</p><p>- &euro;5 increase in maximum rate of all core weekly payments - including disability and carers, which came into effect in January 2022,</p><p>- Increase to the general weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance to &euro;7.60,</p><p>- Increase to the upper earnings disregard limit for Disability Allowance from &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week, effective from June 2022,</p><p>- An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 from June 2022,</p><p>- An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner, also from June 2022</p><p>- Increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 to &euro;33 per week. (The weekly means threshold was also increased by &euro;20 from &euro;100 to &euro;120.)  Both measures took effect from Budget day. </p><p>For those in financial difficulty, the Supplementary Welfare Allowance is also available. This is a means-tested payment available through the Department's Intreo Centres.</p><p>The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.</p><p>I trust that the Deputy will find this information useful.</p></reply>

The Commission&rsquo;s Fifth Interim report, which was published in March 2019, covered burial arrangements in the institutions. The final report of the Commission was published in January 2021.</p>  <p>  The Commission concluded that it is likely that some of the children who died in Bessborough are buried in the grounds but was unable to find any physical or documentary evidence of this. The Commission carried out cartographic and landscape assessments of possible unrecorded burial arrangements and also followed up with people on responses to its appeal seeking information about burials in Bessborough. As no evidence of locations was found, the Commission did not consider it feasible to excavate the full available site, which amounts to 60 acres.  </p>  <p>  Given the uncertainties regarding burials at Bessborough it would be challenging to devise a Compulsory Purchase Order scheme. Direct state intervention on private property would be potentially disproportionate if based on speculative grounds and even unconstitutional as a result. </p>  <p>  I have engaged with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage with a view to supporting local authorities, including Cork City Council, in incorporating appropriate policies on protection of burial sites into their development plans. Cork City Council's recent decision to afford protection to an area in the grounds of Bessborough is worth highlighting in this context.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for relevant planning authorities, Cork City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in this instance, to make determinations regarding planned developments in the grounds of Bessborough. I consistently highlighted that it is important to have regard to any need for further investigations by appropriate experts in relation to works commencing on a site like Bessborough. I also emphasised that any development should give adequate consideration to requests from survivors and their families for appropriate access and respectful memorialisation. In 2021, I made submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork City Council as part of the normal planning process in respect of two planning applications made on the Bessborough lands, requesting that due consideration be given to the sensitivity of the site and the conclusions of the Commission. An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused permission to develop the area in question because it was not satisfied that the site was not previously used as a children&rsquo;s burial ground.</p>  <p>  I will continue to raise the importance of respectful treatment of sites linked to former Mother and Baby institutions and promote engagement with relatives of the deceased, former residents and other stakeholders for that purpose.</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months. My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. </p>  <p>  To date, more than 35,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 25,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation. </p>  <p>  Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues.</p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that the hotel named by the Deputy is contracted by my Department to provide accommodation in respect of Ukrainian Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection to a period later in the year. The Department continues to engage with accommodation providers to secure accommodation as the year progresses.</p>  <p>  My Department sits on the cross-sectoral and cross-departmental Humanitarian Crisis Housing Taskforce which is chaired by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and which is leading cross government consideration and development of medium and long-term accommodation solutions. Advancing these properties will involve further engagement with all relevant stakeholders.   </p>  <p>  Due to the scarcity of accommodation available, all options remain under consideration.</p></reply>

Every year, more than 100,000 children participate on the universal pre-school programme (ECCE) and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p>  <p>  Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas. </p>  <p>  Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed an expected lower demand for early learning and childcare. This gave rise to unprecedented vacancy rates &ndash; an overall vacancy rate of 21% and vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years of 20% and 10% respectively. </p>  <p>  In April of this year, City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) undertook a nationwide survey of capacity in early learning and childcare services. This survey was undertaken as part of the Action Plan put in place by my Department to respond to the early learning and childcare needs of Ukrainian children and their families. This survey was followed in May by the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Survey that is undertaken by Pobal. </p>  <p>  Preliminary analysis of the latest data captured by CCC and Pobal reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13% and the vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years 14% and 6% respectively.</p>  <p>  The network of 30 CCC across the country are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places.</p>  <p>  I am also taking a range of steps to address issues of under supply. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Under the National Action Plan for Childminding, I have committed to opening up access to the NCS to parents who use childminders following the extension of regulation to childminders, which is expected to happen within the first 2-3 years of the Plan. </p>  <p>  My Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, is in the process of updating the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. </p>  <p>  In addition, City/County Childcare Committees have been mobilised to engage proactively with services to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need.  </p>  <p>  Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

First time registrations and renewals for customers outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) through the Garda Station network. The allocation of appointments with GNIB is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, nine temporary extension of immigration and international protection permissions were provided to 31 May 2022. These extensions were available to all persons required to register and allowed them the opportunity to renew their registration, either online with my Department if residing in Dublin, or nationally with their local immigration office. </p>  <p>  Permissions were extended on the same terms and conditions as the permission already held. Any non-EEA national whose Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card had expired was allowed to rely on each of the published notices on my Department's website to prove their immigration permission was renewed in line with them.</p>  <p>  These extensions were made in the context of an uncertain health and international travel situation to provide assistance and assurance to people who use our immigration services.</p>  <p>  Now that those circumstances are returning to normal, it is important that we also return to a more normal way of doing business. This includes in relation to first-time registrations and renewals, and processes and procedures are in place to allow customers to do so.</p>  <p>  At present, there are no plans to introduce a helpline as suggested by the Deputy. However, there is already a Helpdesk system in place where Dublin based customers experiencing difficulties or who have urgent requirements can email my Department at immigrationsupport@justice.ie. This is staffed by the Registration Office customer service team,  who are available to support and process their requests. </p>  <p>  Customers residing elsewhere should contact their local Garda Immigration office for supports and advice.</p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a number of measures in order to support all applicants through the registration process with detailed guidance notes and videos, in several languages, available on my Department's immigration website (www.irishimmigration.ie).</p>  <p>  Since July 2020, Dublin based customers who are seeking to renew their permission and receive a new IRP card can do so fully online at: inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login. Since its introduction, more than 138,000 renewal applications have been completed.  Customers can now apply up to 12 weeks in advance of their current permission&rsquo;s expiration date and I have significantly increased staff capacity to process the applications on hand due to high demand. </p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the current unprecedented demand for first-time registration appointments, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (1800 741 741) was introduced for customers. The current operating hours are 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday and all appointments for Dublin based customers to register their immigration permission for the first time are now issued through this service. Operators offer one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group.</p>  <p>  To date the service has provided 27,428 appointments with a further 7,499 appointments booked to early August and applications are currently being processed on a seven days a week basis.</p>  <p>  My Department and in particular staff of our frontline immigration services are doing all that we can to continue to provide a quality service to our customers during this period of unprecedented demand.  The situation will continue to be monitored, in the weeks and months ahead in order to maintain and further improve on service delivery to our customers.</p></reply>

The Historical Investigation Coordination Unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to support this work. </p>  <p>  Operation Denton is a distinct strand in the work of Kenova, an analytical review rather than a criminal investigation and, in the circumstances, it was necessary to obtain the advices of the Office of the Attorney General with regard to the available legal measures to facilitate cooperation. The Deputy will appreciate that the necessary information-sharing framework must be in place to facilitate cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Operation Denton in order to protect any sensitive data being transferred. </p>  <p>  As I previously advised the Deputy, following receipt of advices from the Attorney General, work is nearing completion in my Department on an appropriate mechanism to facilitate this cooperation and Government approval was received on 21 June in this regard.  It is expected that the mechanism will be in place in the very near future. </p>  <p>  Officials of this Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs have been engaging with KENOVA and victims groups with regard to this matter.</p></reply>

Coroners are independent quasi-judicial office holders whose core function is to investigate sudden and unexplained deaths so that a death certificate can be issued. My Department does not have a role in directing the work of coroners or in individual death investigation cases.  The exercise of statutory powers by a Coroner during an inquest is entirely a matter for the relevant Coroner.</p>  <p>  The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019 clarified, strengthened and modernised coroner&rsquo;s powers in the reporting, investigation and inquest of deaths. The scope of enquiries at inquest was expanded beyond being limited to establishing the medical cause of death, to seeking to establish, to the extent the coroner considers necessary, the circumstances in which the death occurred. The Act also broadened the coroner&rsquo;s powers relating to mandatory reporting and inquest of maternal deaths, deaths in custody or childcare situations and significant new powers to compel witnesses and evidence at inquest.</p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019 amended section 17 of the Coroners Act 1962 to require a coroner to hold an inquest in cases where a death of a person is a maternal or late maternal death.  The definitions used regarding maternal death or late maternal death accord with those used by the World Health Organisation.  The Act further provides for mandatory reporting to a coroner of a stillbirth, death intrapartum, or infant death.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Section 24 of the Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019 amended section 38 of the Coroners Act 1962 to provide for increased powers for a coroner in relation to the taking of evidence at an inquest, including a power to direct any person to produce documents or things necessary for the proper conduct of the inquest, and to direct a witness to answer questions.

The Court stated that if the law in this area is to be changed, it would have to be done by way of legislation, rather than by an evolution in the case-law.  </p>  <p>  A personal injury action may be brought by an injured person, or a wrongful death action may be brought under section 48 of the Civil Liability Act 1961 by his or her dependents after his or her death, but it is not possible for both of these actions to be brought arising from the same wrongful act. </p>  <p>  These issues are under ongoing examination within my Department.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of December 2017 there were 8,027 patients waiting for a cataract procedure nationally compared to 5,781 in May 2022.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. Ophthalmology waiting lists are a particular area of focus of this plan</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the attached document, provided to my Department by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, outlines the number of persons with an address in County Kerry who are waiting for a cataract consultation which is provided as Outpatient (OPD) waiting list for Ophthalmology, and the number who are waiting for a cataract operation as Inpatient-Daycase (IPDC) for Cataract surgery at the end of May 2022.</p></reply>

If applicants who were educated as nurses and midwives outside the EU do not meet the theoretical and practice component required but do meet the minimum threshold to proceed to compensation measures, applicants have the option to complete either an adaptation programme, usually carried out in a hospital, or to sit examinations to have their competence verified.  It is essential that applicants meet the requirements in order to protect the public.</p>  <p>Qualifications obtained by applicants in jurisdictions outside the EU are assessed on a case-by-case basis.

The Department of Health, in conjunction with its partners, is committed to supporting and facilitating these wishes and preferences in the years ahead. A clear demonstration of this is in the investment of &euro;195 million, allocated in Budget 2022, to enable the continued delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme as well as the continuation of the &euro;150m allocation made in 2021, which is delivering an unprecedented expansion of home support provision. The Department of Health and the HSE also support a number of complementary Support-Coordination models which will help our older citizens to age in place and reduce the rate of older people transferring to long-term residential care.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is also committed to delivering the vision of the 2019 policy statement on 'Housing Options for Our Ageing Population', jointly published with the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage. The central aim of the policy statement is to increase the housing options available to older people and to facilitate the integration of supports in a more coherent way, particularly between the housing and health sectors, with a view to facilitating people to live at home with dignity and independence for longer.   </p>  <p>  &lsquo;Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland&rsquo; also commits to expanding the housing options available for older persons and sets out specific actions on housing for older people, including a commitment to implementing the 40 actions that were contained in the Housing Options for Our Ageing Population policy statement. A successful housing outcome for older people requires an effective blending of housing and health policy and the cooperation of a range of stakeholders in order to plan productively for the delivery of services to meet the needs of older people.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Housing has advised my Department that it provides housing supports for older people through capital funding provided directly to local authorities for the provision of older persons specific housing. In addition, by way of the Capital Assistance Scheme and the Capital Advance Leasing Facility, the Department of Housing has advised that it provides funding to Approved Housing Bodies who provide housing for older persons. In the case of the housing for older people provided directly by local authorities the rent paid is a &lsquo;differential rent&rsquo; based on the income of the older person.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Health, alongside the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is currently supporting a housing with supports &lsquo;demonstrator project&rsquo; in Inchicore in Dublin. Housing with support is defined as purpose-built, noninstitutional accommodation, where older people have their own front door and where support or care services are available. This is a collaborative, cross-sectoral, and cross-departmental project that recognises the need for a joined-up approach to addressing the critical issue of creating housing choice for our ageing population.  </p>  <p>  This project will deliver 52 homes and is intended to set a new standard for the future of housing provision for older people and to act as an exemplar for others to follow. The &lsquo;Housing with Support&rsquo; model brings together a range of services and supports &ndash; principally relating to housing, community, social and care needs. It will enable older persons to live full lives in their own homes within their own community with independence and reduces the need to move into long term residential care. The total CAS funding approved for the project is &euro;22m (subject to conditions) as well as a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the Department of Health towards additional communal facilities.  The HSE will provide revenue funding for the provision of supports for the tenants when they are in situ. The project has received Stage 4 approval recently and Dublin City Council expect that it will be commencing on site by mid-year year 2022 with a 2024 completion date.</p></reply>

This role includes setting the standards that health and social care professionals must meet to be eligible for registration and maintaining registers of persons who meet those standards. </p><p>There are two forms of application to CORU: applications for the recognition of qualifications received outside the State and applications for registration. Professional qualifications awarded outside the State are assessed through a process of &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; which involves expert assessment of a qualification&rsquo;s alignment with the standards of proficiency required in Ireland, and assessment of professional experience and lifelong learning where required.  Where a health and social care professional qualifies outside the State and applies to register in Ireland, they must apply for the recognition of their qualification. EU/EEA applicants have the right to have their qualifications assessed in accordance with the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and Directive 2005/36/EC on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications and the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2017 (SI No 8 of 2017). Once a completed application is been submitted to CORU, i.e., one containing all the required documentation, a decision must issue within four months.  </p><p>CORU has provided the following data on the average processing time for recognition applications: <table>    <tr>       <th>Therapeutic Professions </th>       <th>Average days to Decision </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dietitians </td>       <td>69 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Occupational Therapist </td>       <td>74 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Physiotherapist </td>       <td>86 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Speech and Language Therapist </td>       <td>84 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Overall (all professions) </td>       <td>85 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>(please note this data refers to the period January 2022 to date)</p><p>It is not possible, at this time, to provide the current average processing timeframe for registration applications across the specified professions. However, the average processing time for registration applications across all professions is currently 8.9 weeks.  </p><p>I met with the Chairperson and CEO of CORU last year and raised the issue of timeframes for the recognition of qualifications and registration applications. Following our discussion, several measures have been initiated by CORU aimed at further reducing timeframes. </p><p>Until last year applicants were required to complete the recognition process before initiating the registration process unless they had confirmed job offers. All applicants are now invited to initiate an application for registration as soon as they have submitted a complete application file to the recognition department. This will have the effect of reducing the period of time required to both complete the recognition and registration process. </p><p>This is part of a suite of innovations that have been initiated following my discussions with CORU. Further steps underway include:</p><p>- Full transfer to an online application system</p><p>- Increased frequency of regulatory decision-making (Registration Board meetings)</p><p>- Assignment of additional temporary staff resources</p><p>- Recruitment of additional expert assessors in &lsquo;under pressure&rsquo; professions</p><p>- Development of a Voice over IP (VoIP) solution to improve communications with applicants</p><p>My Department will continue to support CORU in achieving its strategic vision and improving timeframes for all applicants in the future. </p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. All chronic long-term illnesses, including those not covered by the LTI scheme, require regular clinical reassessment by a medical professional.</p>  <p>  While there are no plans currently to extend the list of illnesses covered by the LTI scheme, the scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. </p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: </p><p>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p><p>Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5. Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p><p>6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p><p>The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

The plan proposes ambitious additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end.</p>  <p>  This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address the issues facing these children. Both current and capital funding has been provided in 2022 to support this initiative.</p>  <p>  Both current and capital funding totalling &euro;17.43 million has been approved for this initiative. The plan will result in an additional 67 spinal fusions and 28 spinal other procedures for children with Scoliosis, as well as an additional 141 procedures for children with Spina Bifida. The plan also allocates substantial paediatric orthopaedic procedures at Cappagh orthopaedic hospital, with 720 additional procedures planned for the year.</p>  <p>  By using the capacity provided by Cappagh for less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites. The impact of the plan has already been recorded with increased activity year to date. Year to date by the end of May 2022, 197 scoliosis procedures had been carried out, compared to 156 for the same period in 2019. The number of patients waiting longer than 6 months for a scoliosis procedure has also reduced to 79 by the end of May 2022, compared to 103 in August 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Minister, I have asked the HSE to provide you with a direct response. </p></reply>

This is now known as Opioid Agonist Treatment (OATs) . The HSE is leading in this action, and it includes examining potential mechanisms to increase access to OATs such as the expansion of GP prescribing, nurse led prescribing  and the provision of OATs in community-based settings and homeless services. </p>  <p>  Over the last two years, arising from and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant progress has been made in this action, notably -  a substantial group of 1000 additional people were inducted into the OAT programme. This was achieved through an allocation of additional funding of &euro;4.2m from my Department in 2021 and significant support from community based addiction services, homeless services and GPs. Further resources of &euro;10 million were provided to meet the health needs of people experiencing homelessness and addiction during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  This work is continuing and in Budgets 2021 and 2022, I secured significant additional funding of &euro;17 million to support the implementation of the health actions in the national drugs strategy. </p>  <p>  Six strategic implementation groups with independent chairs have been established to drive the strategic priorities identified in the midterm review of the national drugs strategy which concluded in 2021.</p>  <p>  One of the groups has specific responsibility for the third strategic priority which aims to develop integrated care pathways and harm reduction responses for high-risk drug users so as to achieve better health outcomes for people who are homeless, offenders, stimulant users and injecting drug-users.</p>  <p>  High-risk drug users have complex health and social care needs that make them vulnerable to drug overdose and premature death. Integrated care pathways are required to deliver the best outcomes for this cohort, that connect care settings between GPs, primary/community care providers, community specialist teams and hospital-based specialists.</p>  <p>  The issue of improving the availability of OAT under strategic action 2.1.14 can be examined as part of this process.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting people with substance misuse issues on their journey to recovery.</p></reply>

A total of 22,828 contacts were made with the 11,788 households that were selected across the country.  Most contacts were in-person visits, which were subsequently halted due to Covid-19.  The total sample achieved was 5,762, which is 87.8% of the initial target of 6,560.   The fee paid to the third party was &euro;706,850 (including VAT).

It shows significant progress in implementing the action plan for the period 2017 to 2020, with only a small number of the 50 actions outstanding. The Mid-term review also examined the effectiveness of government expenditure on the national drugs strategy, based on key indicators.  It estimated the significant costs for society of drug use for the criminal justice system and the economy.</p>  <p>  While the national drugs strategy covers the period 2017-2025, it included the flexibility to introduce new measures to address emerging issues and outstanding actions in the period 2021-2025. Based on the learning from the mid-term review, six strategic priorities for the national drugs strategy for 2021-2025 were identified. These priorities strengthen the health-led approach, reflect commitments in the Programme for Government and align with the EU drugs strategy and action plan 2021-2025.</p>  <p>  The oversight structures have been revised to drive the implementation of the 6 new strategic priorities for 2021-2025.  These new structures will strengthen the partnership approach and give a stronger voice to civil society in developing national policy. </p>  <p>  The outstanding actions from the National Drugs Strategy will be incorporated into the work plans of the six Strategic Implementation Groups - to be progressed over the period 2022-2025. The requirement for additional resources to support the work of the strategic implementation groups will be considered by the Department of Health and other relevant government departments as part of the annual Estimates process. </p></reply>

The NSAC has commissioned HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) looking at the addition of other SCID types to the NBS programme. This HTA is underway and I am looking forward to receiving a recommendation from the Committee on this condition after the HTA process is finalised later this year.</p>  <p>  The NSAC is now well established and recently published its second annual report which detailed significant progress in 2021. The Committee's first Annual Call for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received a significant response with a total of 53 submissions received, including on newborn screening. Submissions were received from various sources and are now undergoing consideration by the committee. The NSAC will publish its full work programme once it has completed consideration of all submissions.</p>  <p>  Given that this is a complex area careful consideration must be given to the expansion of the NBS programme and these things can take time, however, it is important that decisions are made based on internationally accepted criteria and scientific rigour.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of how difficult it is for parents whose children have received a diagnosis of a rare disease, and how challenging daily life can be for them, their families and their children. It can be an overwhelming situation and can be very isolating for many families because of the significant work that is involved when a rare disease is diagnosed.

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE;</p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

The independent expert has engaged with the organisation whose details are supplied.  Having full information on available peat stocks and the location of sub-30 hectare sites is very important and it is incumbent on those who have this information to fully engage with this work. The work on this action is nearing completion and a final report is expected in a matter of weeks.</p>  <p>  My Department has also commissioned experts to provide focused guidance to those wishing to achieve regulatory compliance for extraction of horticultural peat on sub-30 hectare bogs for supply to the domestic horticulture industry. A draft of this report has been received by my Department and will be finalised shortly.  It is essential that there is full engagement with the regulatory processes in order to ensure peat supply for the domestic horticulture industry.</p>  <p>  My Department, in looking towards the future, continues to support and facilitate research in the development of alternatives to peat for horticulture.  </p></reply>

The Felling and Reforestation Policy document (www.gov.ie/en/publication/19b8d-tree-felling-licences) aims to provide a consolidated source of information on the legal and regulatory framework relating to tree felling.</p>  <p>  Environmental legislation, such as the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive, has led to strengthened controls on forestry operations, ensuring that important environmental considerations are fully taken into account by the Department during the assessment of individual felling licence applications. This has included a greater focus on consultation with relevant bodies, the application of various protocols and procedures (including the Forest Service Appropriate Assessment Procedure), and the requirement for applicants on occasion to provide further information (e.g. a Natura Impact Statement).</p>  <p>  The Habitats and Birds Directives are transposed into Irish law by (inter alia) the European Communities (Birds &amp;amp; Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477 of 2011). As required under the Habitats Directive and as set out under S.I.477 of 2011, on receipt of an  application for a felling licence, the Department must undertake screening to assess whether or not the project is likely to have a significant effect on a Special Area of Conservation or Special Protection Area, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects, in view of both the conservation objectives of that European site (available at www.npws.ie/protectedsites/) and best scientific knowledge.</p>  <p>  If a significant effect is likely, or where uncertainty exists, the Department must either seek a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) from the applicant or carry out an Appropriate Assessment Report itself. Subsequently, the Department will undertake an Appropriate Assessment Determination, primarily to gauge the nature of the impact and the effectiveness of any avoidance or mitigation measures proposed, in order to avoid adverse effects on the integrity of a European site.</p>  <p>  Screening for appropriate assessment, and the appropriate assessment itself, must both be carried out in accordance with Regulation 42 of the European Communities (Birds &amp;amp; Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011. When carrying out the appropriate assessment (if required), the Department must include a determination under Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive as to whether the project would adversely affect the integrity of the Natura site. The assessment carried out under Article 6(3) cannot have any deficiencies or data/information gaps, and must contain complete, precise and definitive findings and conclusions capable of removing all reasonable scientific doubt as to the effects of a project on the European site.The Department can approve the application only after it has ascertained &ndash; either at screening or at appropriate assessment &ndash; that the project will not significantly affect the integrity of the Natura site. </p>  <p>  The Department recognises its responsibilities regarding the conservation of rare birds such as the Hen Harrier, and is fully engaged in the development of the Threat Response Plan, led by the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service, Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage. We are supplied with geographical location information on High Likelihood of Nesting Areas (HLNAs) from the NPWS, in order to underpin the application of its procedures, which have been developed to avoid disruption to breeding Hen Harrier within designated SPAs arising from certain forestry operations. The HLNA information layer is fully integrated into iFORIS and the QGIS system used by Ecologists involved in assessing applications.</p>  <p>On a case-by-case basis, where the Department becomes aware of the presence of a roost site "through referral responses from NPWS, submissions from third parties or other means" - the Department attaches appropriate conditions to the licence and / or grant approval, if issued.  </p></reply>

The Scheme is administered through local authorities, who work closely with local communities and businesses to develop proposals that can make a lasting impact in revitalising rural towns and villages across the country. Since the launch of the Scheme in 2016, almost &euro;113 million has been allocated to more than 1,400 projects across Ireland. </p>  <p>  I can confirm an application for funding was submitted to my Department by the organisation referred to by the Deputy under the 2020 Town &amp;amp; Village Renewal Scheme. Funding through the Scheme is awarded on a competitive basis. The successful projects were announced on 8th January 2021 following assessment of the applications by my Department and unfortunately the application in question  was unsuccessful. </p>  <p>It should be noted that the 2022 TVRS is now open for applications, with a closing date for the submission of applications of 22nd July 2022.  The community group in question may wish to explore the possibility of submitting an application through their local authority for this year's Scheme.  It is expected that successful application under the 2022 scheme will be announced towards the end of the year.</p></reply>

The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated national network of 400 remote working hubs by 2025.</p>  <p>  In furtherance of this commitment, my Department&rsquo;s focus to date has been on strategically developing a national hubs network, and adding capacity to Ireland's existing remote working infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  Over &euro;100m has been invested in the development of remote working facilities through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Successful projects are developed in collaboration with Local Authorities and Communities with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs.</p>  <p>  In May 2021, I launched our National Hubs Network - Connected Hubs.  Connected Hubs is a shared online booking and payments platform for member hubs and their users.  There are currently 249 remote and co-working facilities across the State on Connected Hubs. This number is growing all the time meaning we are well on track to meet our target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025. The network includes a diverse range of hubs, services and facilities, thus facilitating companies of different sizes. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that following the launch of Our Rural Future in 2021, the immediate priority over the past year has been on establishing the national hubs network, putting the necessary infrastructure in place and achieving an initial critical mass. </p>  <p>  Following strong progress on the establishment phase of the project with hubs now in place across every county, our focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. This will include working with our enterprise agencies as well as the private and public sector to raise awareness of the Connected Hubs network and its benefits for both workers and employers. To this end, I recently launched a new Voucher Scheme which will allow users who register on ConnectedHubs.ie to avail of three free days working from a Hub between now and the end of August.</p></reply>
