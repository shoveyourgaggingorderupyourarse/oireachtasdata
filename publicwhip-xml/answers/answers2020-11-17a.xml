There is no universal approach. There are a number of countries, which do not allow for the formation of representative associations in their armed forces and others which allow full Union membership. </p>  <p>  However, there is a common theme in that restrictions on the right to strike are generally accepted and this has been confirmed by the European Committee of Social Rights. In 2017, the European Committee of Social Rights, in a non-binding ruling, found that Ireland was not in violation of the European Social Charter in respect of the prohibition of the right of military personnel to strike. However it found that Ireland was in violation of the Charter in respect of the right to organise, that is to affiliate to certain organisations, and the right to negotiate collective agreements.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the basis for the complaint pre-dates a number of significant change in how the Permanent Defence Force representative associations engage in collective bargaining. In the past, contemporaneous negotiations, referred to as a parallel process, were conducted with non-ICTU affiliated members, including the Permanent Defence Force representative associations. In a change to previous practice, in the course of the negotiations which led to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Permanent Defence Force representative associations were represented alongside the other public service unions and associations at the negotiations, which were held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  With regard to the right to organise, that is to affiliate to certain organisations, the European Committee of Social Rights, in arriving at its decision, took into an account a statement made in the complaint which claimed that ICTU had stated that &ldquo;PDFORRA could be affiliated to ICTU with whatever conditions the Government deemed necessary&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  This was considered as part of an independent review of the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force which was completed in 2018.  One of the recommendations from that review was that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with ICTU to explore the practicalities of a Permanent Defence Force representative association forming association/affiliation with ICTU, while giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service.</p>  <p>  Defence management (civil and military) have engaged in discussions with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and ICTU regarding the practicalities of a Defence Forces representative association forming association/affiliation with ICTU. These discussions explored matters of concern to all parties and were constructive. However, PDFORRA initiated legal proceedings on this matter on 26 June 2020.</p>  <p>  As this matter is now subject to litigation, it would not be appropriate to comment further.</p></reply>

The actual drawdown of funding will be dependent on the number and scale of CSDP missions going forward, the elements of agreed common funding and agreement on the various assistance measures for partner funding.</p>  <p>  Discussions continue in Brussels on the scope of the measure and the exact provisions and it would seem that that will be agreed before member States turn to consider the annual budget.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s role in the European Peace Facility does not have any impact on our neutrality. Decisions in relation to EU military operations overseas and generally in the area of CSDP require unanimity at Council.  As such, Ireland continues along with all other member States to retain a veto in this regard.</p></reply>

Opportunities to fill vacancies in a speedier fashion have been explored and the in the past few years the scope for Direct Entry has expanded, and continues to expand, as a means of filling specialist posts.</p>  <p>  The interest that exists in applying for a career in the Permanent Defence Force through Direct Entry streams is demonstrated by the number of applications that were received for 8 Direct Entry competitions held in 2020.  These 8 Naval Service competitions were in respect of Chefs, Engine Room Artificers, Hull Artificers, Electrical Artificer, Radio/Radar Technician, Operations Branch Officer, Electrical Engineering Officer, and Marine Engineering Officer.</p>  <p>  I am of course aware that there is competition in the private sector for many of the skills on demand in the Permanent Defence Force. It is for this reason that I have recently secured the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to allow for flexibility, with regard to starting point on scales, in the recruitment of certain specialists.</p>  <p>  In addition, a review of recruitment practices and processes in the Permanent Defence Force, mandated under the High Level Implementation Plan Arising from Public Service Pay Commission report, examined atypical recruitment including Direct Entry as part of its work. This report will shortly be finalised.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to returning the strength of the Permanent Defence Force to full establishment strength, mindful of the challenges that exist and that I have previously acknowledged.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-17a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111700064#WRB01300"><p>The Government has acknowledged that there are retention difficulties in the Defence Forces. This is a feature of the highly competitive jobs market that has existed and the demand for personnel, particularly those with specialist skills sets. This is not confined to Ireland and also impacted other military forces internationally.</p>  <p>  A range of factors influence an individual&rsquo;s decision to stay in the Defence Forces. These include career progression opportunities, pay, personal development opportunities, work&ndash;life balance, job stimulation, work environment and external job opportunities. Accordingly a broad range of measures are being progressed to encourage members of the PDF to continue to serve in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The report of the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) on retention and recruitment in the Permanent Defence Force, which was accepted by Government last year, contains a wide range of recommendations to address recruitment and retention difficulties. This included both non-pay and pay related measures. Whilst certain of the pay measures were introduced immediately, others will be progressed as part of the next pay agreement. I have also outlined previously additional measure that I have taken to deal with particular issues in the Naval Service.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the increases under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, have also been paid to members of the Defence Forces. By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the pay-scales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p>  <p>  The introduction of schemes to allow for the re-commissioning of former Officers and the re-enlistment of former enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force have assisted in addressing certain skills gaps, and the return of these personnel, including pilots, is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  Work in also continuing on a range of non-pay projects as part of the High Level Implementation Plan arising from the PSPC Report, enhanced workforce planning; enhanced professional military education; bespoke leadership training; development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy; a review of barriers to extended participation in the PDF; the development of further non-pay retention measures; and consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas. All of these measures will assist in making the Defence forces a better place to work, better support those that wish to stay and ultimately assist with retention.</p>  <p>  There is no quick fix to the challenges facing the Defence Forces today. However, there have been successes in regenerating capacity. I am fully committed, as are the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff, to restoring the capacity of the Defence Forces and to implementing the full range of actions to ensure that this happens as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The White Paper on Defence &ndash; Update 2019, which was published in December 2019 following Government approval, is the first in a new fixed cycle of defence reviews which the Government decided to introduce when it approved the White Paper in 2015.  The Update follows the approach set out in the White Paper.  It provides that these reviews are to consider progress made since 2015 and any revisions required.  Further, these reviews are to encompass a fully updated assessment of the security environment with a fresh consideration of implications for overall policy requirements, associated tasks, capability development and resourcing.</p>  <p>  Implementation of all actions and projects is being carried out by civil-military teams on a phased basis over a ten-year period out to 2025 and is receiving continuous joint civil/military oversight of progress. All of the actions or projects are being implemented in addition to the substantial body of work conducted by the civil and military elements of the Department of Defence on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  As part of this, the Update includes a comprehensive review of overall progress with White Paper implementation.  Since publication of the White Paper, a total of 95 separate projects have been identified for completion over a ten-year period.  Included in the Update is a full breakdown of the current status of all projects and actions as well as a full report, on a chapter by chapter basis, of the outcome of the review of implementation.  (The Update is available to download on my Department&rsquo;s website.)</p>  <p>  To provide flexibility, projects may be sub-divided or merged, changing the top-line number.  Currently,  the number to be implemented stands at 95, with this number subject to further change as the process evolves.  42 of these projects have been initiated with 20 closed and a number of others due to close shortly. Following on from the White Paper Update and the Government&rsquo;s High Level Plan to implement the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission senior civil and military management are concluding a review of the projects which will result in reprioritisation of certain projects.  This takes account of work that is progressing across the organisation which has been contributing to implementation of the White Paper.</p>  <p>  Implementation on a phased basis is necessary in order to reflect Programme for a Partnership Government and Strategy Statement commitments, the related nature of some projects and resourcing implications.</p>  <p>  While it is currently intended to have all projects initiated or completed by the end of the ten year implementation programme, work in certain areas will continue beyond 2025 in order to ensure that changes, improvements and actions envisaged in the White Paper are sustained and that the positive outcomes endure and are embedded in the day to day business of the Defence Organisation.</p></reply>

The current shortfall is especially marked in specialist areas, where small numbers are more vulnerable to gaps.   Without giving rise to any compromise on safety, the impact of these shortfalls has resulted in greater pressure on individual members and units. There has also been an impact on the operational availability of the Naval Service, and an impact on the overall number of operational ships, which is a situation that has to be managed carefully. </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that no Naval Service vessel proceeds to sea unless they have sufficient personnel. There is a minimum manning level for all classes of ships currently in the Naval Service. This minimum manning level covers overall numbers required to sail and also numbers of technicians/specialists that are required on board. Defence Force's authorities have assured me that no Naval Service vessel proceeds to sea unless they have sufficient personnel as per the minimum manning. </p>  <p>  I can also assure the Deputy and the House that there is no political pressure from within Government to send a ship to sea if it is not safe to do so.  The focus for me as Minister for Defence is returning the Naval Service to full capacity. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding current challenges being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations.</p></reply>

This represents an overall gross increase of over &euro;32 million on 2020 and follows on from previous increases that have seen the Defence Vote Group funding envelope increase by over 13% since 2018. This significant level of funding ensures that adequate resources are available to the Defence Organisation to carry out all its assigned roles and deliver on White Paper commitments.  </p>  <p>  The Defence Vote provides for pay and non-pay current expenditure of some &euro;679 million in the Defence Vote. The pay allocation provides for the pay and allowances of up to 9,500 PDF personnel, 550 civilians (technicians, trades, etc.) and 355 civil servants as well as paid training for members of the Reserve Defence Force. This allocation includes all outstanding commitments arising from the Public Sector Stability Agreement 2018-2020 along with the restoration of the 5% cut in Permanent Defence Force allowances imposed under FEMPI. The non-pay allocation provides for expenditure on essential and ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs including utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training. </p>  <p>  The capital allocation of &euro;131 million will facilitate an ongoing programme of equipment replacement and infrastructural development, as set out in the Defence Equipment Development Plan and Infrastructure Development Plan. </p>  <p>  Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society also receive funding from the Defence Vote.</p>  <p>  The 2021 allocation for Vote 35 (Army Pensions) is &euro;262.6 million, an increase of &euro;3.5 million on 2020. This allocation ensures that sufficient funding is available to meet the retirement benefits of some 12,750 former members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.</p>  <p>  I am very pleased with the outcome of Budget 2021 and the significant funding envelope of over one billion euro provided to the Defence Sector. This funding will enable the Defence Organisation to continue implementing the organisational priorities into 2021 and beyond, as outlined in the White Paper on Defence and reinforced by White Paper Update 2019.</p></reply>

An interim report was presented to the joint civil/military Steering Group established to oversee the project in November 2018. The Steering Group accepted the findings of the Phase 1 report on the basis that they merited a more in-depth analysis of the proposal.</p>  <p>  The second phase of the feasibility study is examining the proposal with specific reference to potential academic linkages, staffing, governance, funding, infrastructure, and risks and constraints. A draft Phase 2 report has been submitted and is currently under consideration by the Steering Group. </p>  <p>  The final report, once completed, will inform the next steps to be taken.</p></reply>

By way of an example, overall Officer numbers are just seventeen off the full establishment figure as at 30th September 2020. Whilst I appreciate that experience levels have declined at some ranks, and that there remain gaps in certain areas, the continued attraction of Officer Cadets in what was a competitive jobs market is indicative of the continued attractiveness of such a career. </p><p>Further initiatives such as re-commissioning of former Air Corps pilots has also assisted in boosting much needed specialists and I understand that further specialist Officers will be re-commissioned. The re-enlistment of former enlisted personnel is another initiative that is to be welcomed. Whilst the numbers being inducted are lower than initially anticipated, all will play an important role in restoring capacity.</p><p>The recent introduction of a sea-going service commitment scheme for Naval Service personnel is an example of a measure aimed at retaining experienced personnel and follows the reintroduction of a successful service commitment scheme for Flying Officers in the Air Corps. </p><p>The fact is that the restoration of capacity in the Defence Forces will take time. The Programme for Government provides that a Commission on the Defence Forces will be tasked with examining a range of issues. This will provide an opportunity to chart the future direction of the Defence Forces. There is also a commitment to establish a pay review body for the Defence Forces when the Commission has completed its work.  </p><p>Working closely with the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff, and a range of key stakeholders, I am confident that the current challenges facing the Defence Forces can be overcome.</p></reply>

As an employer, I wish to state categorically that I do not condone in any way any such behaviour within the Defence Forces. I urge anyone who has any complaint which they think constitutes a criminal offence to report their concerns to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. A serving member of the Defence Forces could report such matters via the chain of command or the military police.</p>  <p>  From time to time matters pertaining to allegations of sex abuse are brought to my attention and I confirm that I have received correspondence containing allegations of inappropriate conduct in the workplace of an historical nature. The manner in which I receive this type of information and particularly if it is historical in nature, has a bearing on how I can deal with it. It may be received via a third party, it may be disclosed under condition of a person&rsquo;s identity being protected or it may be received under privilege. Whenever I receive such information, I treat the matter with the utmost importance from the point of view of both the complainant and of those accused of wrongdoing who must have their right to fair procedures protected. This, in my opinion, is best achieved by those who may have suffered serious wrong reporting their complaints of a criminal nature to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have the lawful authority to investigate and to prosecute. This process, while not an easy road for anyone to travel, is designed to bring about a result in accordance with law and to provide suitable penalties against those who are convicted of crimes. The Garda&iacute; have the expertise and skills to treat all of those in this process with dignity and respect and especially those who come forward with traumatic detail. </p>  <p>  All members of the Defence Forces, Permanent and Reserve, have a right to be treated with respect, equality and dignity and to carry out their duties free from any form of sexual harassment, harassment or bullying. These unacceptable forms of behaviour are not tolerated in the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The 2015 White Paper on Defence confirms this arrangement, stating the Defence Forces will make available resources and expertise, including advice and information, to Enterprise Ireland supported companies and research institutes.  In return the Defence Forces are exposed to new technologies and research that could inform the direction and development of their military capabilities. </p>  <p>  The Defence Enterprise Committee oversees this arrangement and comprises of personnel from the Department of Defence, Enterprise Ireland and the Defence Forces.  Projects proposed by institutes and companies, where they are seeking to partner with, or involve Defence Forces participation are submitted to the Defence Enterprise Committee for consideration. All capabilities to be researched are vetted and agreed at the highest level of civil and military management in the Defence Organisation having regard to the appropriateness, viability and benefits of the proposal. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces assistance to industry and research institutions is by way of providing evaluation of technology, research and innovation, provision of information on military requirements and the Defence Forces considered views on trends in specific capability areas. Capabilities which have been and are being researched by the Defence Forces in cooperation with research companies and institutions include Maritime Surveillance; Energy Conservation; Counter Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) research, including CBRN Protection; overseas deployment training; and Improvised Explosives Devices (IED) detection and destruction.  Such capabilities may be used at home and also abroad on crisis management missions and operations including humanitarian and peace-keeping missions. </p>  <p>  There has been a number of successful projects and collaborations since the Defence Enterprise Committee was formed, included in these are three Horizon 2020 projects.  These projects comprise of a range of different entities, all three of which have links to Irish academia, industry or research institutes.  The Defence Forces provided end user perspective to these research projects and contributed to the findings. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces jointly produced a policy on intellectual property rights as well as a Defence Enterprise strategy which supports the work of the Committee.  </p>  <p>   My Department, with the support of Enterprise Ireland and through the Defence Enterprise Committee, will continue look at ways in which the Defence Organisation can continue to support and work with industry, academia and research institutes.</p></reply>

The White Paper also sets out a blueprint for the development of the RDF and confirms that its primary role is to support the PDF in crisis situations and to contribute to State ceremonial events. In non-crisis situations the main focus is on training for this role. </p>  <p>  The White Paper states that the types of tasks that the RDF could be required to undertake in crisis situations is varied. It acknowledges that there may be professional skills that on occasion may not be readily available in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) and outlines an intention to harness specialist skills that members of the Reserve may have to better support the PDF. </p>  <p>  A range of actions and supports, including legislative provisions, are required to develop this concept. In this context, a Skills Survey of the RDF has been undertaken which provides an overview of the range of skills available within the Reserve. A Workforce Planning project is underway which will identify skills sets in the PDF and identify appropriate measures to address any such gaps. The skills survey undertaken of the RDF will assist in identifying possible options to address gaps.  Options to underpin the engagement of Reservists will be identified as the various stages of this work unfold. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 2020 contains a commitment to establish an Independent Commission on the Defence Forces. The work of the Commission will also encompass the role and contribution of the RDF, including its legislation; the regulations governing the RDF, the development of the First Line Reserve (FLR) and whether specialists from the RDF should be able to serve overseas.</p></reply>

Consequently, the response to cyber threats is a whole-of-Government challenge, with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications taking the lead role and with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, is the primary authority responsible for cyber security in the State, including incident response, cyber resilience and information provision. While the primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to Cyber Security relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. This is being done in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognizing the potential and important role of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s current National Cyber Security Strategy was published in December 2019 and follows on from the country's first Strategy which was issued in 2015. It is a broader and more comprehensive document than the last one, and takes advantage of the operational experience gained by the National Cyber Security Centre from 2015 to 2019, and from ongoing national and international engagements in the area.  Department of Defence officials and the Defence Forces inputted to the drawing up of this Strategy.</p>  <p>  Department officials and members of the Defence Forces are actively involved in the implementation of the new Strategy which, in conjunction with the White Paper on Defence 2015, will continue to inform our engagement in this critical area. This includes work to develop an updated, detailed risk assessment of the current vulnerability of all Critical National Infrastructure and services to cyber-attacks and the provision of a member of the Defence Forces for secondment to the Cyber Security Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia. My Officials also actively participate on the Inter-Departmental Committee overseeing implementation of the Strategy which is chaired by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have a Memorandum of Understanding and a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to provide support in the area of national cyber security.  The overall aim is to improve the cyber security of the State through various types of assistance and support while also ensuring the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are prioritised, including the ongoing sharing of information and analyses of risks. </p>  <p>  While it would also be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific cyber activities and the resourcing of same by the Defence Forces, for both security and operational reasons, I can inform the Deputy that the priority for the Defence Forces Communications and Information Services Corps is the protection of the Defence Forces Communications Network. Other activities undertaken by the CIS Corps include the monitoring and handling of cyber incidents, the enhancement of Defence Forces cyber situational awareness and the provision of cyber awareness training.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding some mechanical and staffing issues being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations.</p></reply>

Reflecting the two different EU classifications of the development status of different regions in Ireland, there will be two ERDF Operational Programmes (OP):</p>  <p>  1. An OP for the area designated as &lsquo;Region in Transition&rsquo;, (as its GDP is 75%-100% of the EU27 average), is to be managed by the Northern Western Regional Assembly (NWRA).</p>  <p>  2. An OP for the Southern Regional Area, and for the Eastern and Midlands Regional Authority Area, both designated as "Developed", (as GDP is more than 100% of the EU27 average), is to be managed by the Southern Regional Authority, with significant input from the Eastern and Midlands Regional Assembly. </p>  <p>  In 2019, following a competitive tender, the Department undertook a review of Structures for the Management of ERDF in advance of the next programming round. ERDF funding will reduce further, to an expected &euro;350m, over this 7 year period. The level of co-financing required to draw down these funds is expected to increase for all but the Northern Western region and activities eligible for support are likely to be concentrated further. Against this background, it was decided to undertake a review to streamline and simplify the structures in place for the administration of these funds. The Crowe Review, which will be published shortly, put forward a number of options for future structures and for administrative improvements.  </p>  <p>   The ERDF Operational Programmes are developed under an EU Partnership model, with extensive consultation involving the Regional Assemblies, social partners and voluntary groups on how the ERDF funding allocation will be spent and implemented for the 2021-27 period. Alongside my Department,  the Managing Authorities will assist in the drafting the ERDF Operational Programmes. The Managing Authorities will monitor implementation on the ground as well as managing projects' compliance with EU Regulations and submitting claims for reimbursement to the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of ERDF has in the past, and will continue in the future, to support projects in all parts of Ireland.</p></reply>

Gross voted expenditure on Social Protection, inclusive of expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund, amounts to 9.7%, 15.6% and 12.1% for 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. Finally, gross voted expenditure on Education over the three year period amounts to 5.1%, 5.9% and 5.8% respectively. In order to provide a like-for-like comparison over the three years, expenditure on the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for 2020 and 2021 has been included alongside that by the Department of Education to arrive at these figures. </p>  <p>  Taken together, expenditure on these three areas amount to 23% of GNI* for 2019, 31.5% in 2020 and 28.5% in 2021. </p>  <p>In addition, as outlined in the Expenditure Report 2021, there are unallocated amounts in respect of a Covid-19 Contingency Reserve of &euro;2.1 billion and a Recovery Fund of &euro;3.4 billion.  The allocation of additional resources to these sectors from these unallocated amounts would impact on the ratios for 2021.</p></reply>

Capital expenditure has been increased by a further &euro;1,706 million in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing the overall capital investment to &euro;9,872 million.</p>  <p>  Of this major investment, Budget 2021 provides just over &euro;1bn in investment in the health sector. This is an increase of &euro;156m or 18% over the Revised Estimates 2020 allocation. The capital funding for health in 2021 will allow for the continuing delivery of modern health facilities and equipment to improve and expand service provision and capacity across the country.  This will support key aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare and of Project Ireland 2040 as well as providing the capital assets necessary in the context of the COVID-19 response and the resumption of non-COVID services. This funding will allow progress on key developments including: </p>  <p>  - Progress on key projects to expand and upgrade bed capacity across the system in line with the Health Service Capacity Review and in response to the Covid 19 emergency. Beds have been delivered across the system at an accelerated pace in 2020 including: community beds, intermediate care beds, acute beds and ICU/HDU beds. Work in increasing bed capacity will continue in 2021 across the system on a range of projects - some scheduled for completion in 2021 and others with works commencing and progressing in 2021, for delivery after 2021.</p>  <p>  - 2021 will see the continued development of our Primary Care infrastructure in line with Sl&aacute;intecare and further investment in long-term residential accommodation for the elderly and for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  - The Mental Health Capital Programme will continue to focus on upgrading existing facilities and expansion of services in 2021, following the completion of construction on the National Forensic Mental Hospital in 2020.  Other Mental Health projects across the Acute and Community settings will be progressing or commencing in 2021.</p>  <p>  - An extensive programme of investment in equipment, including diagnostic equipment such as CT and MRI Scanners, has taken place in 2020. This will continue in 2021 as part of the National Equipment Replacement Programme. Investment will continue in our national ambulance fleet as well as investment in ambulance bases.</p>  <p>  - New priorities and learnings from the pandemic, which will enable the implementation of the Service Continuity Programme, will continue to be funded such as projects to reconfigure facilities which will address infection control and staff safety issues.</p>  <p>  I also would remind the Deputy that on the 3rd November last I launched the "Review to Renew" - that is, the review of the National Development Plan.  The revised NDP will be published by summer 2021. It will set out the overall capital investment envelope for the decade to 2030 and will include five year rolling departmental capital ceilings and priorities. The revised NDP will be the blueprint for the development of our infrastructure for the next ten years.</p>  <p>  Pending this review it is not my intention to adjust the capital funding beyond the major commitments already set out for next year in Budget 2021. Ceilings for 2022 to 2026 will be finalised as part of the review of the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

What is clear is that remote working arrangements for civil servants is very likely into the future. The Commissioners are actively involved in a cross departmental working group assisting in developing a policy around remote working. The publication, and subsequent implementation of this policy, will influence future demands for property.</p>  <p>  Government Departments and Agencies will in due course need to undertake detailed workforce planning exercises that identify roles that may be suited to remote working, and roles that may be location specific.  The Commissioners will work closely with Departments to identify accommodation solutions that will facilitate the implementation of Government policy in this regard.</p>  <p>  It would be anticipated that if remote working practices become widely used within the civil service that this would, in the medium to longer term, have a downward pressure on property demands.  In such circumstances the Commissioners would make all necessary adjustments to the size of the portfolio.</p></reply>

There are important measures in place at all times to ensure that our budgetary targets are being met. These measures continue to be in place for all public expenditure, including core expenditure as well as additional expenditure allocated as part of the response to Covid-19. As is usual, my Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that all expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels. </p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-October 2020 was &euro;65,547 million. This is &euro;8,604 million, or 15.1% ahead of profile. It should be noted however, that expenditure profiles for the year were published in February and are based on the expenditure allocations set out in the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume. This means that the impact of additional resources allocated in respect of Covid-19 are not reflected in these profiles. As such, spending can be expected to run significantly ahead of profile for the remainder of the year. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;60,000 million, is &euro;8,662 million, or 16.9% above profile. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;5,547 million, is &euro;58 million, or 1% below profile and up &euro;886 million, or 19% on October 2019.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of identified overruns in 2020 to date relate to expenditure allocated in response to Covid-19. Current expenditure in the Department of Health is ahead of profile by &euro;1.36 billion at end October 2020. This is due to the drawdown of funds to the HSE, to support maximising capacity within the system and to allow for the purchase of necessary equipment such as PPE. The Department of Social Protection is ahead of profile by almost &euro;6.9 billion at this point in the year. This is due to payments introduced in respect of Covid-19 to support employees and businesses. There is a Covid-19 related impact on the Department of Transport, for which current expenditure is &euro;307 million ahead of profile at end October. This is due to the drop in passenger numbers and associated revenue as a result of public health measures. </p>  <p>  Looking at capital expenditure, the impact of Covid-19 can also be seen. Capital expenditure in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is ahead of profile for end-October by &euro;587 million. This relates to the additional funding which was allocated in light of the impact of Covid-19 on businesses. The Department of Education is ahead of profile on capital expenditure by &euro;91 million. The main driver of this is the issuing of additional minor works grants in light of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Government has allocated significant additional resources to Departments in response to Covid-19. Expenditure Report 2021 set out total gross voted expenditure of &euro;87.1 billion for 2020, with additional expenditure of &euro;16.7 billion primarily driven by Covid-19. These allocations are being made in the usual way, with Estimates agreed by Government and voted on by the D&aacute;il. A number of Revised Estimates and Further Revised Estimates have been approved by the D&aacute;il in recent weeks and months to give effect to these increased allocations for 2020. A number of Supplementary Estimates have also been presented to the D&aacute;il in the last number of weeks and work is currently ongoing to finalise the last number of Supplementary Estimates for 2020.</p></reply>

The CFRAM Programme studied 80% of properties at risk from the primary causes of flooding in Ireland, in communities that house almost two thirds of the national population.</p>  <p>  The key output of the CFRAM Programme was the Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP&rsquo;s). Informed by costs, benefits and environmental factors, the FRMPs proposed a flood relief scheme for Carlingford and Greenore. The proposed scheme would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) and two pumping stations, protecting 409 properties.</p>  <p>  The progression of this proposed scheme to detail design is supported by &euro;1bn planned investment under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project Ireland 2040. The final design of a feasible scheme, informed through further public consultation, may change from that proposed by the FRMPs and will also include adaptation measures against the risk from climate change.</p>  <p>  The FRMPs and the planned &euro;1bn investment support five additional proposed schemes for County Louth, at Dundalk / Blackrock South, Drogheda, Carlingford / Greenore, Baltray and Ardee. Louth County Council, working with the Office of Public Works, has agreed to be the Lead Authority in the delivery of these flood relief schemes. The Council chairs the Project Steering Group, that has agreed to prioritise the progression of these schemes.</p>  <p>  The tender for Engineering Consultancy Services has recently been awarded for Dundalk/Blackrock South and Ardee that are being progressed simultaneously. The tender brief for Drogheda and Baltray, also being progressed simultaneously, is being finalised and it is expected to be advertised in the coming weeks. Immediately thereafter the tender brief for the Carlingford and Greenore scheme will be developed.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has established an Engineering Consultancy Framework Agreements, which Louth County Council are using to procure services to progress the design, development and planning of each project as quickly as possible to construction. In addition, the Council has been provided with additional staffing resources by the OPW to assist in the implementation of these schemes.</p></reply>

The two programmes have a combined value of &euro;553m and support peace and reconciliation and economic and social cohesion across the eligible region.  The programmes are 85% funded by the EU.  The programmes are managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), which is jointly sponsored by my Department and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Both programmes are now fully committed to a total of 130 cross-border projects.  The &euro;270 PEACE IV programme is supporting 96 projects across the eligible region in the areas of Shared Education, Children and Young People, Shared Spaces and Services, and Building Positive Relations.  INTERREG VA has a total value of &euro;283m and supports 34 cross border projects under the themes Research and Innovation, Environment, Sustainable Transport and Health.  </p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement ratified by the EU and the UK in January 2020 provides for the full completion of PEACE IV and INTERREG VA post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  As part of its May 2018 proposals for the Multi-Annual Financial Framework and EU Cohesion Policy for the 2021-27 period, the European Commission proposed a special new cross-border programme, PEACE PLUS, to continue and build on the work of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes. PEACE PLUS will effectively combine the existing PEACE and INTERREG activity strands into one cohesive new programme which will support peace, prosperity and cooperation across Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland. Provision for the new programme is included in the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK, as well as in the Political Declaration.  </p>  <p>  Programme development for PEACE PLUS is now well advanced. This process is being led by the SEUPB, in close cooperation with my Department and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland, and supported by a Programme Development Steering Group consisting of representatives of major stakeholders for the new programme. </p>  <p>  The quantum of funding for the PEACE PLUS programme will be determined as part of the EU UK future relationship negotiations.  The EU has already committed to a special allocation of &euro;120m ERDF for PEACE PLUS, which, in addition to the ERDF funding which will be provided through the Ireland's European Territorial Cooperation allocation, will help build a fund for a bold and ambitious programme.</p></reply>

The policy rationale  is to avoid a situation where individuals benefit from both a valuable public service pension and also a public service salary. In that context, pension abatement represents a suitable and measured response to legitimate public concerns.</p>  <p>  Section 52(1) to section 52(5) of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 (the Act) provides for pension abatement across the public service. In particular, section 52(1) provides for a reduction in the pension that has been awarded to a public service pensioner who has returned to employment in the public service so that the person concerned will not receive more in combined pension and salary payments than they would have received had they remained working.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there is discretion under Section 52(4) of the  Act, to grant a waiver of abatement.

Fingal County Council has advised that due to the ecological sensitivity of the site and the complexity of the issues involved, it is likely that the assessment of this plan, which will include extensive public consultation, environmental assessment and the relevant consent processes, will take over a year to complete.</p>  <p>  The OPW continues to co-operate and assist Fingal County Council in every way and if a viable option is identified, the Council may submit a further application for funding to the Office of Public Works or other Government Departments as appropriate.  A meeting last took place on 12th June 2020 between the Office of Public Works and Fingal County Council where the public consultation process which is in preparation was discussed. This consultation process ended on the 16th October 2020 and full details are available on www.fingal.ie</p>  <p>  I understand Fingal County Council is set to carry out emergency works in Portrane including protection works at Quay Road and the relocation of Seabees at Burrow beach. The works are required following serious coastal erosion caused by storm force winds and strong tidal surges during the summer and the recent removal and relocation of the seabees.</p>  <p>  Engineering experts have recommended an extension of the existing rock armour defence by approximately 50 metres along Quay Road to protect the area through the winter of 2020/21.</p>  <p>  An examination of services and ground conditions around the toilets will be carried out as soon as the rock armour works are completed to establish if any additional protective works are required in that location. Following the completion of rock armour, the demolition and removal of the existing toilets is planned. Temporary public toilets are expected to be installed during November.</p>  <p>  In addition, Fingal County Council plans to relocate 100 seabees which were recently moved without authorisation causing damage to the dune system at Beach Lane. Following review by expert engineers the Council intends to replace these Seabees to their optimal position in the sea defence system to continue to reduce and delay coastal erosion. </p>  <p>  The remedial works outlined above are to be undertaken under provisions of the Roads Act and will take approximately three weeks.</p></reply>

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works' &euro;1 billion flood relief investment programme, and on completion will protect 236 properties in the town.</p>  <p>  The Scheme requires formal Confirmation to proceed from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER). This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts, which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme. This involves, inter alia, a formal review by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR), along with a Natura Impact Statement, as part of the formal Confirmation process. </p>  <p>  The statutory public consultation period required in relation to this process ran from July 28th to August 28th. The initial phase of the EIAR and NIS reviews were carried out by consultants engaged for this purpose by DPER, during September and early October. On foot of submissions from the public consultation and the EIAR and NIS reviews, DPER have issued a Request for Further Information to the OPW for reply, pursuant to ADA regulations 2019, to ensure that the design of the scheme complies with relevant environmental directives and regulations.  </p>  <p>  The OPW, Wexford County Council, and Mott Mc Donald consultants are currently reviewing the material received from DPER and will formally respond to the points raised by the review of the scheme by DPER and their consultants. As the review of the material has not yet been completed it is not possible to provide an accurate timeline for response. Completion of the above tasks and the progression of the flood relief scheme is a priority for all parties.</p></reply>

This was in light of the budgetary and staffing constraints affecting the public service at that time. Up to that date, about a third of the target numbers, over 3,400 posts were decentralised. </p><p>Over 50% of civil servants are now working in offices located outside of Dublin.  </p><p>A further programme for decentralisation is not being considered by the Government at this present time. </p><p>You will be aware that the Civil Service Mobility scheme was recently developed under Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan and is now in the final stages of roll out. This is a very welcomed development for so many civil servants who wish to either relocate, or to move within their location to a new organisation. </p><p>The scheme, which is being implemented on a phased basis, went live over 2018 and 2019 for the general civil service grades of Clerical Officer and Executive Officer to apply for a move between and within 46 location zones through an open and transparent automated system.</p><p>Current figures show that over 5,000 staff have applied (25% of participating grades) with over 550 moves complete. 1,240 Dublin-based staff (14% of participating grades) have applied for Mobility to organisations located outside of Dublin with 104 moves complete. 973 Dublin-based staff (8% of participating grades) have applied to remain in Dublin and move to a different organisation.</p><p>This month the scheme extended to the grade of Assistant Principal, and plans are on target for the scheme to incorporate the grades of Higher Executive Officer and Administrative Officer in the first half of 2021. When this phase is complete Mobility will be in place for all general civil service grades from Clerical Officer up to Assistant Secretary.</p><p>Further information on the Mobility scheme and the interactive map which shows details of all civil service buildings can be found at </p><p>You may also be aware that work is underway on the next renewal plan, Civil Service Renewal 2030. This strategy will outline an ambitious programme of reform for the Irish Civil Service over a 10 year period. Changes in how we work and where we work as a result of the pandemic will inform this plan.  </p><p>The public health requirements brought about by the pandemic have led to the transformation of work arrangements across all sectors and businesses. It has highlighted the potential for the Civil Service to work from locations beyond the 'traditional office'. Like many other organisations the Civil Service has shown that much of the work previously carried out in offices can be done remotely. </p><p>Our experience over the last six months has shown that we must now consider new and alternative work practices that can achieve positive outcomes for our Civil Service. Different working models are possible, one of which is the concept of regional Government office &ldquo;hubs&rdquo;.</p><p>Similar to many Government buildings in provincial towns, establishing well located departmental office hubs is certainly one option for consideration.  Hub spaces facilitate remote working for those where home based work is not a real alternative beyond COVID. They also have the potential to address staff commuting issues and the cost issues associated with a concentration in Dublin and the Central Business District.  </p><p>Any decision to set up regional hubs requires: careful analysis of the most suitable locations; must meet the operational needs of Government departments; and must be consistent with the National Planning Framework.  As part the analysis on regional hubs over 18,500 Civil Servants nationwide to-date have shared their views on this issue through the Civil Service Employee Engagement Survey.</p></reply>

In this context I have taken the opportunity to meet with the relevant parties involved in these schemes to hear at first hand their issues of concern. </p>  <p>  The particular matter raised by the Deputy is a complex one that raises significant policy, legal and exchequer cost issues. The Deputy may be aware that the State is not the employer of the workers concerned. A detailed scoping exercise was carried out  in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications, in both cost and precedent terms, of the issues involved. The outcome to the scoping exercise was that the matter has potentially very significant implications for the exchequer, particularly if consequential demands were to be made by all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors. </p>  <p>  This is a factor which must be borne in mind in our approach to this issue.

A core goal of this Department is to continue to deliver improved, cost-effective public services across a range of themes such as governance, accountability, procurement, shared services, organisational reform and property management. </p>  <p>  The current framework for public service reform and innovation, Our Public Service 2020 (OPS2020), builds on earlier reforms while expanding their scope in order to accelerate the digital delivery of public services, deliver better outcomes for citizens, drive innovation and develop our people and organisations. </p>  <p>  Notable examples of reform initiatives that have being delivered include:</p>  <p>  - Transforming and driving Digital Delivery of Services, such as, for example, An Garda Siochana&rsquo;s Active Mobility Service; Passport on-line; Library Service&rsquo;s My Open Library initiative; Revenue Commissioners PAYE Modernisation programme;</p>  <p>  - Driving the take-up of Robotic Process Automation through the dedicated Procurement Framework, which enables swift and easy draw down of licenses, supports and expertise to create efficiencies in back-office functions;</p>  <p>  - Innovation: A &euro;1m Innovation Fund has been established to support Public Service innovation projects; the establishment of a central Innovation Support Team; creation of a Public-Service wide Innovation Network and a Public-Service wide Innovation Week (held most recently on 19-23 October 2020); and the publication of a National Innovation Strategy, launched just last week, which focuses on making our public services more efficient and effective for the citizen. </p>  <p>  - A significant strategic workforce planning initiative commenced in selected public service organisations; </p>  <p>  - An initiative to support greater diversity and inclusion in our  Public Service;</p>  <p>  - Creation of a Public Service Leadership Board (PSLB) - at Secretary General equivalent level- supported by the Public Service Management Group (PSMG) to oversee the governance of reform efforts.</p>  <p>  Reforms are also underway outside of the OPS2020 framework in organisations across the civil and public services. For example, the  programme of reforms set out in the 2014 Civil Service Renewal Plan to support a higher performing organisation continues to be embedded within the Civil Service. A number of budgetary reforms have also been introduced in recent years to guide Minster&rsquo;s decisions on overall fiscal policy, including fiscal rules, new spending code, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews. </p>  <p>  My Department has now begun consultations on developing a successor framework to OPS2020 and similar work is well-advanced in framing a further renewal plan for the Civil Service to 2030.  The vision and strategy underpinning this will focus on large-scale ambitious transformation to support greater cost-effectiveness through enhanced digital service delivery; developing our data infrastructure, and; building the workforce and workplace of the future following the extraordinary changes that are occurring as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

The position remains as I set out in that response.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau is a multi-agency statutory body established under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996. The Criminal Assets Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2016, all funds collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are forwarded to the Central Exchequer Fund. It is this Central Fund from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment, including the provision of drug prevention programmes. The Constitution requires, and Government accounting principles provide, that public moneys be spent only as voted or approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, unless otherwise provided by statute.</p>  <p>  While there have been calls from time to time for moneys confiscated by the Criminal Assets Bureau to be ring fenced, a policy of ring-fencing moneys obtained by the Exchequer, and the reallocation of same for a specific purpose, runs contrary to the normal Estimates process. While allowing for a small number of very specific targeted exceptions, it is a general principle of public financial management that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would tend to constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.</p>  <p>  I understand that there would also be practical difficulties owing to the variable and uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau in any given year. In addition, the potential delays caused by legal challenges to court disposal orders would also be problematic in terms of continuity of provision of funding to specific programmes or projects, whether drug related or otherwise. Therefore, because of the variable value and nature of assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau in any given year, such a revenue source would not be reliable for facilitating the proper planning of drug prevention programmes and the delivery of such services.  Accordingly, there are no proposals to change the existing arrangements.</p></reply>

While the overall cost of the European Peace Facility was referenced by the paper as a likely source of increased spending in an international defence context, analysis of the cost was not included in the paper's Terms of Reference.</p>  <p>  The aim of the European Peace Facility is to provide the European Union with a single off-Budget fund for the period 2021-2027, to run alongside the next Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF). It will finance all Common Foreign and Security Policy actions having military or defence implications. In this regard, it replaces the current African Peace Facility and the Athena mechanism.</p>  <p>  As stated in the Spending Review, the &euro;5 billion ceiling agreed for the European Peace Facility represents a significant increase on previous Common Foreign and Security Policy spending. As with other EU contributions, the scale of Ireland's contribution to the European Peace Facility will be assessed based on a Gross National Income distribution key. However, the key used to calculate Ireland's level of contribution has not yet been decided. In addition, no final agreement has yet been reached at EU level on the funding mechanism, and as yet there has been no Government decision on participation. As such, the question of analysis of the cost is an ongoing matter.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that any additional cost implications to the Exchequer due to the European Peace Facility will arise in the normal course as a result of EU membership and participation in EU Common Security and Defence Policy, rather than as a result of participation in any overseas peacekeeping operations.</p></reply>

The majority of capital projects are delivered on budget and on time and there is a high level of professionalism across the sectors.  Following last year&rsquo;s update of the Public Spending Code and in line with the principle of proportionality, the process for smaller projects in the Public Spending Code has been streamlined and the process for larger projects supports a better consideration of options, risks, costs and deliverability. </p>  <p>  However, the update of the Public Spending Code last year combined with lessons learned from domestic projects and international best practice highlighted the need for more structured scrutiny of major public investment projects, particularly in the areas of planned delivery, costing, and risk.  Major public investment projects are considered to be those with an estimated project cost in excess of &euro;100 million. There are over 40 projects in this category in the Exchequer funded element of the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  All the evidence shows that the greatest impact on improving project outcomes comes from careful project preparation and that external reviews from an independent party can be instrumental to enable good project and investment governance. </p>  <p>  The new process is being informed by international practice and consultation with public sector stakeholders. It will involve an independent peer review of major two key stages in the project life-cycle, specifically when the preferred delivery option is chosen and before approval is given to go to tender. The reviews will be conducted by experts in infrastructure delivery and will draw on international expertise where relevant. </p>  <p>  The reviews will consider key issues including:</p>  <p>  - Robustness of planned delivery; </p>  <p>  - Accuracy of cost forecasts; </p>  <p>  - Consideration of risk; and</p>  <p>  - Appropriateness of procurement strategies.</p>  <p>   External reviews of major projects will mean that Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks, and benefits.

As such there are no separate reduced pay scales for civil and public servants.</p><p>Under the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) 2018 &ndash; 2020, it was agreed to examine the remaining salary scale issues, associated with the addition of the extra points, for those recruited to entry grades after January 2011. The report, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in March 2018, estimates the point in time cost of advancing new entrants to the public service two points along their incremental scales. The report estimated a cost of &euro;199.8m in respect of 60,513 new entrants, an average cost of &euro;3,300 per FTE.</p><p>Following this report, lengthy and intensive negotiations with the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions took place over 2018 resulting in an agreement on new entrant salary scales being reached in September 2018. </p><p>The main components of the agreement are:</p><p>- where two additional scale points were applied to pay scales under the Haddington Road Agreement, it was agreed that there will be two separate interventions in the pay scales as they apply to new entrant public servants recruited since January 2011. </p><p>- the two separate interventions will take place at point 4 and point 8 of the pay scales. The practical effect of this is that for new entrants the relevant points on the scale will be bypassed, thereby reducing the time spent on the scale for progression to the maximum point.</p><p>- in situations where only one point was added to the existing pay scale under Haddington Road, then the first point (i.e Point 4) is bypassed by eligible new entrants. </p><p>- this measure was applied from 1 March 2019 and will be applied to each new entrant as they reach the relevant scale points (point 4 and point 8) on their current increment date. </p><p>This is an agreement of considerable scale and complexity, each element of which was the product of negotiation with ICTU. </p><p>New entrant teachers, recruited after January 2011, are covered by the agreement.</p></reply>

Over 800 people participated online, comprising a broad range of civil society, community, sectoral, and political representatives, across the island of Ireland and in Britain.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government announced the Shared Island Fund, with a planned &euro;500m to be made available out to 2025. The Shared Island Fund provides significant new, multiannual capital funding for investment on a strategic basis in collaborative North/South projects that will support the commitments and objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  A Shared Island unit has been established in my Department and its work is proceeding to examine the considerations for a shared future in which all traditions are mutually respected, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. Operationally, the unit is focusing its work in three areas: commissioning research, fostering dialogue, and building a Shared Island agenda, including delivery of the commitments in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Strengthening social, economic and political links on the island and the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South are key objectives for this work.</p>  <p>  As I said in Dublin Castle on 22 October, the role of civil society is central to the Shared Island initiative. Reflecting that, I launched the Shared Island Dialogue series to foster constructive and inclusive civic dialogue on all aspects of a shared future on the island. </p>  <p>  The Dialogue series will start later this month and focus on important issues for people on the island in the years ahead, such as the environment, health, education and economy, and on key civic concerns that are addressed in the Good Friday Agreement, including identity and equality.</p>  <p>  The Shared Island Dialogues will actively seek as broad a range of perspective and experience from civil society on the island as possible and ensure the inclusion of voices that have been under-represented in the Peace Process, including women, young people and new communities on the island.</p>  <p>  The Dialogue series is complimentary to the range of discussions and engagement that already happen in community and civic settings, which has always been an important part of the Peace Process founded on the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Philanthropic support for civic and community engagement has also been a long-standing and welcome feature of the Peace Process. I am fully supportive of that continuing, as a valuable complement to Government support, including through our Reconciliation Fund, contributions to the International Fund for Ireland, and cooperation with the European Union and the UK to deliver the EU PEACE PLUS programme over 2021-27.</p></reply>

The approach to the Plan will be based on a number of key themes - Building Resilience Across Enterprise and Sectors, An Inclusive and Balanced Recovery, and Future Proofing our Economy and Society - and will be supported by two core principles, maintaining sustainable and credible public finances and supporting strategic investment to boost jobs and growth.

I also took the opportunity to invite the President-elect to visit Ireland after he takes office, and as soon as circumstances allow. I have sent letters of congratulations reiterating this message.</p>  <p>  Any programme for a visit will only be developed once planning for such a visit is underway and will be for agreement between the two sides. However, consideration will certainly be given to an invitation to President-elect Biden to speak to a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

The Restart Plus scheme was launched on 10 August with an additional budget of &euro;300m from the Government&rsquo;s July Jobs Stimulus as a result of the increasing demand for the scheme.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the scheme was to help with the cost of reopening or adapting business premises so that normal business can resume. Grant payments are administered by the Local Authorities via the commercial rates system and disbursements are made through Enterprise Ireland to the Local Authorities, based on estimated schedules per county. In total, over 106,000 applications have been managed under both Restart schemes, with over 90,000 of these approved for payment. The amounts paid are published every week on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the Restart Plus scheme, several top-up payments were approved by Government to deal with additional financial pressures caused by necessary COVID-19 restrictions. These included top-ups in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, a top-up for &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs, top-ups in Dublin and Donegal, and most recently, a top-up of 30% for all eligible businesses nationally.</p>  <p>  In view of the additional costs to the scheme arising from these top-ups, my Department has worked with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and Local Authorities on the remaining funding requirements over recent weeks and disbursement is now underway. In this context, my Department has engaged with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to introduce the Restart Grant Plus for B&amp;Bs as notified under the July Stimulus. Disbursement for this scheme is now underway.</p>  <p>  The Restart Plus scheme closed as of 31 October and has effectively been replaced by the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

The Commission has informed Amazon of its preliminary view that it has breached EU antitrust rules by distorting competition in online retail markets.</p><p>It is important to state at this juncture that Amazon has not been found to hold a dominant position in the relevant retail market. The Commission in the first instance must prove dominance and only then can it investigate any alleged exclusionary behaviour and abuse of this dominance. </p><p>These cases form part of the Commission&rsquo;s wide-ranging competition agenda which is intended to ensure that there is fair competition in all EU markets.  This agenda also includes a forthcoming legislative proposal which aims to both ensure a fair-trading environment in the EU platform economy by tackling the market power of certain platforms and increasing the innovation potential and capacity of the EU online platform economy. This proposal, termed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), will seek to ensure that certain large platforms behave fairly and can be challenged by new entrants and existing competitors, so that consumers have the widest choice and the Single Market remains competitive and open to innovations. I understand that the Commission's proposals will cover online marketplaces and are due to be published next month.</p><p>In relation to a proposal to establish a new platform for retailers here, I think there is broad consensus concerning the benefits for retailers brought about by online platforms. These platforms can lower the costs of starting and especially scaling a business and can facilitate cross-border trading and access to new markets. The importance of these platforms has become even more apparent during the global Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>I want to flag an important piece of legislation aimed at the users of online platforms including online intermediaries. The EU Platform to Business (P2B) Regulation came into effect on 12 July 2020 and aims to promote fairness and transparency for business users of online platforms. Under the Regulation, platforms are required to make their standard terms and conditions more transparent, and easily available to business users. The Regulation also provides effective and quick means to resolve disputes between businesses and online platform intermediaries via:</p><p>- platforms establishing internal complaints handling systems; </p><p>- commitments by platforms to engage mediation in good faith; and </p><p>- allowing businesses to be represented by associations or organizations in cases against platforms to stop or prohibit any non-compliance with the requirements of the Regulation. </p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission have been designated the national public body designated with enforcing the Regulation under - European Union (Promoting Fairness and Transparency for Business Users of Online Intermediation Services) Regulations 2020.</p><p>The Retail Forum was established in 2014 to provide a platform for engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers and the public sector on key concerns for the retail sector. The Forum,  which is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for Business, Employment and Retail, enables key issues affecting the retail sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government, or by industry itself, to support sustainable jobs growth in the sector.</p><p>The work of the Forum has led to the introduction of the very successful Online Retail Scheme which supports retailers in growing their sales through online channels domestically and internationally. The Forum continues to focus on a range of policy issues including digital transformation. This important support combined with the continuing emphasis on digitalisation ensure Irish retailers are well placed to avail of the benefits online intermediaries and marketplaces present to them. </p></reply>

Both are underpinned by the Credit Guarantee Act 2012. These are important loan schemes which remove the requirement of collateral for businesses in loans which can be used for liquidity and investment purposes.</p>  <p>  The CGS has operated since 2012 with variations in the level of contingent liability. Its current annual contingent liability is set out in S.I. 70 of 2017, Section 4(2). Here, the maximum annual lending amount is &euro;150 million with a risk share of 80 percent. It further indicates that the aggregate amount liable to be paid by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is set at 13 percent. This results in a maximum annual contingent liability for the Department of &euro;15.6 million. One claim of &euro;89,000 was received in 2020 so far under the 2015 CGS Scheme. In 2020, no other claims have been received.  </p>  <p>  The CCGS was passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas in July of this year as a scheme to establish stability to the lending market as a result of the COVID-19 health emergency. Since its launch on the 7th of September 1,817 applications for over &euro;104 million have been received by the three participating banks. More lenders are being evaluated and will be coming online over the next weeks. In order to give  businesses certainty, &euro;2 billion was agreed by government as the size of the Scheme. With no portfolio cap and a risk share of 80 percent, the contingent liability is a maximum of &euro;1.6 billion. My Department assumes the liability for all but primary producers for whom liability will be with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  Forecasting was conducted within my Department with input included from the expertise of the credit departments of the participating finance providers. &euro;25 million was set aside in Budget 2021 for the contingent liability for those businesses covered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Since the Budget, the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework, which underpins the legal parameters of the CCGS has been extended from the end of 2020 to the 30th of June 2021. This should allow more Irish businesses to access finance at reduced interest rates through the Scheme but may have implications for increased demand on the contingent liability levels. As a result, my officials are reviewing the level of liability set for 2021.   </p></reply>

I am aware that these closures can have secondary effects impacting landlords and I recognise that many landlords have debt repayment obligations as well as other ongoing costs.    </p>  <p>  The issue of commercial rents is primarily a contractual matter for the parties involved. However, the Government has urged landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. Landlords should be willing to do what they can to help their tenants to continue to operate rather than facing the risk of a vacant premises and inability to obtain new tenants.  Equally, tenants should pay what they can and speak with their landlord when difficulties arise.   </p>  <p>  On 1st October, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents, which has been agreed with landlords and business representatives for commercial renters. The aim of the Code is to facilitate these discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. The voluntary Code of Conduct has been developed based on examples from other jurisdictions and with input from other Departments, State agencies and key stakeholders.    </p>  <p>  However, this Code should not be seen in isolation. To date, over &euro;24 billion had been made available in support measures for businesses, including a package of over &euro;7 billion worth of measures as part of the July Jobs Stimulus, and a total budgetary package of over &euro;17 billion announced in Budget 2021 to help those impacted by COVID-19 and related public health restrictions. This further demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the country through this crisis.   </p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) announced as part of Budget 2021 will allow the Government to provide targeted support for those sectors and businesses that have been significantly impacted by the public health restrictions. It will help businesses to meet ongoing costs such as commercial rents, utilities or insurance.

However, there are complex issues at play in this area, which are understandable given the sensitive nature of the medical data in question. These efforts will continue, focussing, in particular, on pricing trends.  </p>  <p>  Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging was not introduced. A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017 to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  In September, I launched a new national waste policy for the period 2020-2025, A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy. This plan contains a range of measures to empower households through enhanced consumer protection requirements. It also envisages an enhanced monitoring of the market to ensure no changes occur in the relative price stability.</p></reply>

Indigenous production from the Corrib and Kinsale gas fields supplied an estimated 47% of this demand with the remaining 53% imported via two interconnector pipelines from Moffat in Scotland.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's National Energy and Climate Plan, published in August, sets out projections for natural gas production and use in Ireland. Based on these projections, it is expected that natural gas demand will increase by circa 10% to 15% by the middle of the decade before dropping back to current levels by 2030. The increased demand in the near term is primarily driven by the growth in electricity demand along with natural gas replacing coal, peat and oil in electricity generation. The reduction in the second half of the decade is expected as a result of increased levels of renewable electricity displacing generation from natural gas. </p>  <p>  The National Energy and Climate Plan projections indicate that by 2025 circa 80%, and by 2030 over 90%, of the natural gas consumed in Ireland will be imported via the two pipelines from Scotland. The expected reduction in domestic production is a result of the closure of the Kinsale gas field earlier this year, the forecast decline in production from the Corrib gas field and the Programme for Government commitment to end the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of natural gas.</p>  <p>  The National Energy and Climate Plan set a target of 1.6 TWh of natural gas use (equivalent to 3% of total use) to be replaced by biomethane produced from agriculture and food waste and injected into the gas grid by 2030. My Department is currently considering a number of policy options to support the production of biomethane. </p>  <p>  It should be noted the National Energy and Climate Plan is based on the commitments set out in the Climate Action Plan published in 2019. The implementation of the commitments set out in the Programme for Government may result in reductions in the level of natural gas use over the coming years and thereby lowering the level of import dependency. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems which is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050. The review will include a detailed technical analysis and a public consultation. A request for tender for the technical analysis was published earlier this month and I expect that the review to be completed by the end of 2021.    </p></reply>

A key aspect of delivering on this ambition will be enacting the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which will be reinforced by credible on-going policy.   </p>  <p>  The Bill will establish a 2050 climate neutrality objective in law and place all relevant climate plans and strategies on a statutory footing. The Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets and related sectoral targets will be set, with every sector contributing, ensuring we continue to work to achieve a broad political and societal consensus on the transition to a climate neutral economy and society. Putting these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action.</p>  <p>  The Bill also provides appropriate oversight by Government, a strengthened Climate Change Advisory Council and a significantly strengthened accountability and oversight role by the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  Each year, relevant Ministers will be required to give account annually to an Oireachtas Committee on their performance in adhering to their sector&rsquo;s carbon budget. Where Ministers are not in compliance with the targets, they will need to outline what consequential measures are envisaged and respond to any recommendations made by the Committee within three months. This &lsquo;comply or explain&rsquo; approach will ensure greater oversight to drive delivery.</p>  <p>  The annual revision to the Climate Action Plan acts as a further review mechanism and opportunity to re-adjust or refocus actions, if required, to ensure targets are achieved. </p>  <p>  The existing governance mechanisms established on an administrative basis by the 2019 Climate Action Plan will also continue, with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Climate Action Delivery Board overseeing implementation of actions under the Climate Action Plan and publishing quarterly progress reports.   </p></reply>

I am meeting with the IPU in the coming weeks to discuss the matters raised.</p>  <p>  While it is long-standing Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise, as part of our commitment to a sustainable nationwide post office network. </p>  <p>  An Post put in place a Strategic Plan, covering the period 2017 &ndash; 2021, in response to the structural challenges faced by the postal sector. </p>  <p>  In order to implement the Plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of &euro;150m, the Minister for Finance provided a loan of &euro;30m to the company in December 2017 to support the renewal of the post office network (&euro;15m) and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service (&euro;15m). </p>  <p>  As part of the delivery of the plan the company was split into two distinct business units, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail.</p>  <p>  An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is about getting communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. With an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services.  We will work closely with An Post to see if there is scope to channel additional services through the network. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network. </p></reply>

The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. As of 9 November, almost 126,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed by NBI, which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. </p><p>This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area.</p><p>My Department is working with NBI to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans, following on from survey and design work already undertaken. </p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are expected next month in Carrigaline, Co Cork and they will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from the end of January retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.</p><p>Surveying has taken place in Skerries, Balbriggan and North County Dublin and further details are available on specific areas within Dublin through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website . Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 30 October, some 187 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. In addition, school BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband, for educational use only, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Education and Skills. To date, 6 schools have been connected with high speed broadband for educational access only.</p><p>In Dublin, Glenasmole Community Centre, Man of War GAA and Fingal Ravens GAA Club have now been connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband, with more locations planned over the coming months. Balscadden National School has also been connected for educational access only as part of this initiative. Further details can be found at .</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. The aim of the scheme is to deliver efficiency measures in a way which represents the best use of Exchequer funding.  Budget 2021 provided &euro;221.5 million in capital funding for residential and community retrofit programmes next year to be funded by my Department through the SEAI. This represents an additional &euro;100 million, or 82% increase, on the 2020 allocation and is the largest ever budget for the schemes.  Of this allocation, &euro;109 million (&euro;100 million for the Warmer Homes Scheme) is provided to support lower income households to retrofit their homes. This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. </p><p>SEAI originally estimated that works would be completed in approximately 3,500 homes under the scheme this year. Delivery has however been negatively impacted by Covid, particularly between March and June when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.

I recognise how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, including remote working, studying and staying in touch with family members during the Covid-19 crisis. In April of this year, all major telecommunications providers in Ireland committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, a number of operators have implemented further supports for consumers, such as for students in education, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many existing packages and by the introduction of new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. As a result, the market for mobile packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive, which is a positive development for consumers.</p></reply>

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.  </p><p>  I am advised by NBI that, as of 9 November 2020, over 126,000 premises across every county in Ireland have been surveyed, which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area.  The first fibre to the home connections are expected next month in Carrigaline, Co Cork and they will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from the end of January retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.</p><p>  In County Westmeath, I can advise that surveys have commenced in the areas of Mullingar, Sonna, Stonehall, Taghmon, Jamestown, Hopestown and Athlone. Surveys are due to start in areas around Devlin in early 2021. I am advised that build works are scheduled to begin in the summer 2021 in the Mullingar area. Further details are available on specific areas within Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website . Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. </p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 6 November, some 190 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. Further details can be found at . In County Westmeath, BCPs have been installed at Streete Parish Park and Community Hall, Whitehall Community Centre, Milltown Emper Community Centre and Ballycomoyle GAA Club. </p><p>  Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhride has been connected to high speed broadband, for educational access only, as part of the BCP initiative, with Scoil Naomh Michael to be connected in the coming months. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP. </p></reply>

All other passengers must continue to restrict their movements for 14 days unless they are exempted essential workers. The Government also aligned with the updated list of exempted categories of traveller with essential function or need within the EU recommendation.</p><p>The requirement for those arriving from EU orange regions to restrict their movements can be waived, if they have a negative COVID-19 test result from a test taken up to three days before arrival. </p><p>From  midnight 29th November, arrivals from an EU red/grey region and third countries will not be expected to restrict movements following receipt of a negative/not-detected result from a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test taken a minimum of five days after arrival in Ireland. This provision will also be available to arrivals from orange regions who may not have availed of a pre-departure test. </p><p>There are a number of COVID-19 testing technologies currently available or emerging on the commercial market. However, subject to the ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test is the only test result that means the passenger is not expected to follow advice to restrict movements. Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review. </p><p>Testing provision under Ireland&rsquo;s framework for international travel will not be provided through the public health system, but rather will be met by the private commercial sector testing supply on a user pays basis.  As the availability of testing cannot be guaranteed intending passengers wishing to avail of a test should seek an early appointment for a test in advance of travel.</p><p>The Passenger Locator Form, administered by the Department of Health, remains in place for all persons arriving into the State regardless of the &quot;colour&quot; of the location they are arriving from.  Essential transport workers continue to be exempt from completing the form.  The introduction of an online form supports an enhanced system of engagements with arriving passengers. The main purpose of the form is for the targeting of key public health messages to arriving passengers through SMS and email.</p><p>Passengers arriving into Ireland from Denmark are advised of the need to take additional precautions aimed at limiting the spread of the newly discovered virus variant in Denmark of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</p><p>Anyone arriving to Ireland from Denmark should ensure that they follow the existing guidance to restrict movement for a period of 14 days following their arrival into Ireland. This requirement does not apply to international transport workers in the aviation, maritime and road haulage sectors. </p><p>In addition, should any traveller from Denmark develop any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 they should phone their GP immediately and alert them of their recent visit to Denmark.

The recommendations broadly ranged from measures to improve the safety of air travel, to rebuilding regional and international connectivity to making financial support measures available to the sector. The Task force&rsquo;s final report can be viewed at .</p><p>At this point, the majority of the Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendations have been implemented.  With the adoption of the EU&rsquo;s traffic light system for international travel, together with the finalisation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Protocol for Safe Air Travel, there is now a comprehensive set of rules for international air travel based on clear public health advice.  This has been complimented by the HSE&rsquo;s national test, track and trace system, and the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; TravelWise app, which is currently being updated to reflect the adoption of the EU traffic-light system.  </p><p>A number of financial supports have been made available to the aviation industry, including meeting the Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendations for the extension of the wage subsidy scheme and the provision of liquidity supports.  The wage subsidy scheme has now been extended to April of next year, as has the extension on the waiver of commercial rates; while a substantial &euro;2bn in liquidity supports has been made available to all sectors, including the aviation sector, through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund.</p><p>On rebuilding regional and international connectivity, recently a further package of targeted funding for the sector was also announced, amounting to a total of &euro;80m in further funding. This funding will be made available to Cork and Shannon airports, as well as to the smaller regional airports of Knock, Kerry and Donegal, and consists of both capital and operational funding.  In addition to this, and subject to EU state aid approval, an airport charges rebate scheme will be rolled out across all of Ireland&rsquo;s airports and will cover the period from January to March to help ensure continued connectivity on core routes throughout the Winter season.</p></reply>

The extension was granted to extend the validity of driving licences that would have expired at a time when it was not possible to renew such licences, and to assist the NDLS resumption while adhering to the return to work protocols. </p>  <p>  Through the NDLS, the RSA has expanded the current online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit applications to enable accessibility online rather than by calling to an office. A Public Services Card and a verified MyGovID account will be required to access the online system.</p>  <p>  To attend in person, an applicant must make an appointment through the NDLS. All appointments must be booked in advance as it is not possible to facilitate any walk-ins due to the social distancing requirements and in the interest of protecting the staff and customers. The RSA has worked with their providers to create the additional capacity through a combination of additional staff, extended and additional operating hours (i.e. Sundays where needed), and the provision of overtime. The introduction of these steps, and the availability of the extended online service will help ease the pressure on the NDLS, free up appointment slots and make it easier to find those slots at local centres.</p>  <p>  In addition,  those 70 years of age and over will be contacted directly by the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) and invited to renew their licence or permit by post. Previously only those aged 70 and over who renew their licence on a yearly basis are invited to renew it by post. As a temporary measure, given the situation with Covid-19, the RSA, through its licensing service the NDLS, will expand the postal renewal option, to those over 70 who renew their licence every three years.</p></reply>

This will include availability for:</p>  <p>  - testing post-arrival (from day 5) for passengers who have arrived from a location that is not on the green list and who wish to avail of a test as a means of reducing the period of restricted movement from 14 days; and</p>  <p>  - testing for departing passengers who need or wish to complete a pre-departure test requirement before travelling to another country.</p>  <p>  Subject to the ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, a Covid-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is currently the only test that is accepted for the purposes of allowing the advice relating to restricted movement to be waived.

Since the publication of the report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to the Continent under close review, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The IMDO recently reviewed the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 GB Landbridge Study and in particular the issue of direct maritime connectivity and capacity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period.  The IMDO analysis shows that there is more than sufficient capacity on existing direct services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for all of the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum.  The shipping industry serving Ireland have shown that they are resilient, responsive and capable, without State intervention, of adjusting to and satisfying market demand.</p>  <p>  My Department has had very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about this issue since January 2019.  We have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to Continental Europe, they will respond.  Additional shipping links were added on direct routes to Continental Europe even during the Covid-19 pandemic in Summer 2020, with further improvements and increases in capacity announced to take place starting from January 2021.  Indeed in the last week, we have seen moves from Irish Ferries and Stena Line to change and increase their direct sailings to Cherbourg from January 2021 so that between them there will be a daily service available from Ireland to France.  This will further increase capacity on that direct Continental Europe route.</p>  <p>  The Government considers that direct State intervention to establish State shipping links in the context of Brexit would likely undermine a market response resulting in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place. Such an intervention would be likely to result in legal challenges from incumbent shipping providers, would result in breaches of EU state aid rules and consequent requirements for repayment of the state aids with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any companies receiving such aid.  It could also create difficulties for the State in extricating itself from the shipping market.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s updated Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published on 9th September 2020, businesses are being asked to consider moving, in advance of the end of the transition period, to direct route options for the movement of goods from Ireland to the Continent, to avoid potential delays and the new procedures that will be introduced associated with using the UK landbridge.  Shipping companies should also continue to assess expected future demand requirements and remain ready to respond to increased capacity demands, and all the indications are that this is happening.</p>  <p>  A communications campaign is currently underway, "ACT now and Prepare to switch", which encourages importers and exporters to focus on the direct route option now. This campaign encourages stakeholders to Assess their current routes to market, Communicate their future needs clearly to shipping companies, and Trial alternative services so that disruption to the GB Landbridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor and keep under review the evolving situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports and will remain in close consultation with the maritime sector and other relevant stakeholders, including importer/exporter/freight logistics associations and companies, as we all prepare for 1 January 2021.</p></reply>

This grant provided up to &euro;3,800 towards the purchase of a new passenger EV for businesses and public entities. Provision of the grant for M1 vehicles ceased in October 2019; however, grant support is still available for new N1 (vans and light trucks) commercial EVs.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, the Minister for Finance announced that fully electric commercial vehicles would be eligible for a 0% Benefit-in-Kind rate, up to &euro;50,000, without mileage conditions until the end of 2022. This announcement represented a significant financial incentive to many operating business vehicles. The Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme also represents a substantial financial benefit to businesses, allowing the cost of commercial EVs and their related infrastructure to be written down in the year of purchase instead of over the traditional eight years. In addition, commercial EVs can avail of toll reductions up to a maximum of &euro;1,000 per annum, as well as lower annual motor tax.  </p>  <p>  The Minister recently approved the introduction of a grant for electric vehicle (EV) demonstration cars in recognition of the important role that such cars play in familiarising consumers with EVs. An EV Purchase Grant of &euro;3,800 is provided in respect of Category M1 demonstration cars registered by EV dealerships approved by the SEAI. The SEAI have notified EV dealerships of the terms and conditions of the grant and the means by which dealerships may apply for and receive the grant.</p>  <p>  An EV Spending Review published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, found that Irelands current range of EV financial incentives are among the most generous in the world. As the Deputy is aware, care must be taken to ensure that a balance is struck between improving EV sales and not placing unsustainable costs on the Exchequer. Priority must remain on the most cost-effective measures that aid in Ireland's transition to a low carbon economy. Under the existing incentive regime we have seen the highest ever EVs sales in the last two months, despite the challenging times we are facing with COVID-19. </p>  <p>  I am committed, in my role as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport to continue to review the EV support schemes on an on-going basis as it is critical that we set Ireland on course to achieving the EV targets outlined in the Climate Action Plan. To this end, an Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Working Group was established to consider the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies available to Government to significantly accelerate EV sales. I am given to understand that the Working Group gave consideration to the role of the commercial sector in helping to hasten this transition. I plan to publish the Recommendations of the Working Group when I have received and considered them.</p></reply>

In line with this mandate, the Central Bank introduced macro-prudential measures for residential mortgage lending by such institutions in February 2015. The objective of these macro prudential measures is to mitigate systemic risk and promote financial stability, to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households to the property market and to reduce the risk of credit spirals from developing in the future. These macro-prudential measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. In general, the maximum mortgage limits are 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income and, for first-time buyers, 90% of the value of the residential property. For second and subsequent buyers the maximum mortgage are 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income and 80% of the value of the residential property. </p>  <p>  However, under the mortgage lending rules framework, banks and other mortgage lenders have a certain flexibility to provide a mortgage loan in excess of the specified LTV and LTI regulatory limits.  For example, the rules allow lenders to provide up to 20 per cent of their mortgage lending to second and subsequent buyers in excess of the 80 per cent LTV threshold.  In addition, borrowers who are currently in negative equity and want to move home by purchasing another property are exempt from the LTV limits.</p>  <p>  These, however, are discretionary exemptions and it is a commercial matter for each individual lender to decide, having regard to its own lending policies and loan underwriting criteria, whether or not it wishes to avail of those various discretions.  Ultimately, subject to the requirement to comply with the provisions of the macro-prudential mortgage lending rules, the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code and other regulatory requirements, it is a matter for each lender to decide whether or not to provide a loan in any particular case, or how much mortgage credit to provide in any particular case. I as Minister for Finance, do not have a role in the commercial decision making processes of credit institutions . This is a commercial matter for each individual credit institution having regard to the relevant legal and regulatory requirements which apply.</p>  <p>  The lending rules were last reviewed in November 2019 with the Central Bank Commission concluding that the mortgage measures as calibrated at that time continued to be effective and no change to the mortgage lending regulations was made. It is expected that the Central Bank&rsquo;s 2020 review of the macro prudential mortgage lending measures will be concluded before the end of the year.   </p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection framework also includes a number of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage and seeks to ensure that lenders are transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle. The Consumer Protection Code 2012 requires regulated entities to carry out affordability and suitability assessment, prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a credit product to a personal consumer. Separately, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 require that creditors assess the creditworthiness of the consumer before concluding a credit agreement. </p>  <p>  However, subject to the requirement to comply with the relevant legal and regulatory requirements which govern the provision of residential mortgage credit to consumers, as indicated it is ultimately a commercial matter for an individual lender to decide whether to offer particular products or whether to provide a new mortgage loan or decide on how much credit to provide in any particular case.</p></reply>

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The CRSS was announced on Budget day and the operational details are being worked though as quickly as possible.  The scheme will be implemented by the Revenue Commissioners who have shown as an organisation that they are very effective in operating schemes to support businesses in this crisis. </p><p>The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.</p><p>Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme.  Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.</p><p>Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. </p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as an outside caterer or an events company, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) or a business in the tourism sector carrying on a trade consisting of, for example, the operation of a gallery or other cultural attraction, located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.</p><p>The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.</p><p>It is not sufficient that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity. </p><p>I would also point out that the CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions.<b></b>Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the and the and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that the Finance Bill is at Committee Stage of the legislative process this week but I have no plans to extend the scheme in the ways suggested.</p><p>There are two steps required to make a claim under the CRSS. The qualifying person must first register for CRSS on Revenue Online Service&rsquo; (ROS) and then complete a claim in respect of a claim period or claim periods. Revenue has been accepting registrations for the scheme since 1 November, and claims will be accepted from today with payments made shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  </p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC.</p>  <p>  A Supreme Court decision of 18 June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgment found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p>  <p>  On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  In order to allow for the PMC assessments to recommence I am bringing forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation. When the Bill is enacted, this will allow for assessments to recommence in circumstances where the legal basis for such assessments is clarified.  </p>  <p>  I consider this to be an interim solution only. While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme. With this in mind I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

Revenue has advised me that over 70% of these checks are fully completed at this time, and have, for the most part, confirmed high levels of compliance by employers with the conditions of the scheme.</p>  <p>  As part of the compliance checks, Revenue requested employers to confirm eligibility for the TWSS by reference to the decline in their turnover in Quarter 2 of 2020 due to COVID-19 related restrictions, and to provide sample payslips confirming payment of the subsidy to their eligible employees. This level of detail should have been readily available to employers as they formed part of the core eligibility criteria for the TWSS. Revenue has confirmed that it did not request employers to submit audited accounts as part of the compliance checks as this was not an eligibility requirement for the scheme. Revenue has also advised me that approximately 1,000 employers were subjected to a more detailed review following the initial compliance checks. Of these, almost 500 are completed at this point with enquiries continuing in respect of the remainder. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s question on TWSS recipient employers availing of &lsquo;other COVID-19 State aided schemes&rsquo;, Revenue has confirmed that, at end September 2020 (the latest date for which the analysis has been completed), approximately 20,000 (30%) of the total number of former TWSS recipient employers were in receipt of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which replaced the TWSS from 1 September 2020. This figure is expected to rise when October data is fully analysed. Revenue has also advised that, as registration for the COVID-19 Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) has only recently commenced, it is not yet possible to provide the number of former TWSS recipient employers now availing of that scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue is not involved in the administration of commercial rates or &lsquo;other specific sector supports&rsquo; outside of the TWSS, EWSS, CRSS subsidy schemes and the Debt Warehousing scheme, which currently contains &euro;2.2 billion of &lsquo;parked&rsquo; tax debt owed by businesses impacted by COVID-19 related restrictions. The Deputy's query on the rates waiver is a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></reply>

As indicated, lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, set out as follows, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a formal loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Where employers avail of this facility, they are not required to advise Revenue and therefore the number of employees reimbursed in this manner is not available. Where employers choose to pay more than &euro;3.20, the excess is subject to deduction of PAYE, PRSI and USC.</p><p>Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.</p><p>Revenue also advise that there has been no recent change in policy in relation to this payment.  This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 was, and still is, at the discretion of the employer.</p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, I am advised that employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use. </p><p>As I announced on Budget day, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home. </p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.  Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website. I am advised by Revenue that where a deduction in respect of expenses in relation to working from home is claimed in a tax return, the amounts are included in a general &lsquo;Expenses&rsquo; field. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the number or value of specific claims in relation to these expenses.</p><p>I am advised that Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM e-Working and Tax.  </p><p>Finally, the 2020 Programme for Government: Our Shared Future contains several commitments related to working from home, including an examination of the &ldquo;feasibility and merits of changing tax arrangements to encourage more people to work remotely&rdquo;, the responsibility for which falls to my Department.  There is also a commitment to the development of a &rdquo;national remote working strategy&rdquo; and to that end, a Remote Working Strategy Inter-Departmental Group has been established.  Officials from my Department are included in this group which is chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  I would say however that any suggestions that banks in Ireland or anywhere in the Eurozone for that matter, can offer customer lending rates at zero or close to that level which is where the ECB main lending rate is, are misplaced. Banks fund themselves from a range of sources with ECB borrowing being only a small fraction of their total balance sheet for sustainability reasons. Banks also need to cover their operating costs (staff, IT etc) and the cost of holding capital raised from the debt markets as well as shareholders.</p>  <p>  I would obviously like to see borrowing rates that are as low as possible for Irish customers particularly in the current difficult environment.</p></reply>

As indicated, lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a formal loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Switch Your Bank public awareness campaign is to raise awareness and promote customer switching of financial products. AIB and Permanent TSB provide the funding for the campaign as part of a range of competition measures agreed with the European Commission under their respective EU restructuring plans.  Two phases have been successfully delivered to date, on time and to budget, with advertisements running on TV, radio and online supported by a dedicated website, www.switchyourbank.ie.</p><p>The final phase of the campaign, which will commence in the new year, moves away from promoting awareness on the benefits of switching and focuses on identifying and developing trial tools which will better enable consumers to complete their switches. My Department is currently undertaking a tender competition, using the services of the Office of Government Procurement, to engage a firm to complete this research. </p><p>The Central Bank has advised me that while financial education is within the remit of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), the Central Bank is committed to raising awareness of the savings that consumers can make by switching their mortgage, as is evidenced by the recent publication of  the Economic Letter entitled .  </p><p>The Letter estimates the potential for savings available to mortgage holders and highlights some of the potential barriers to mortgage switching in Ireland. The research undertaken by the Central Bank demonstrates that a large number of mortgage holders could see significant reductions in repayment costs by switching. The Letter also highlights that behavioural characteristics may pose a barrier to customer engagement, and that those with lower levels of financial literacy and education are more likely to exhibit a high degree of inhibition to switching. </p><p>The Central Bank has also published an to raise consumer awareness and understanding of mortgage switching rules.</p><p>The Economic Letter and associated activity is building on work undertaken in previous years to promote mortgage switching.</p><p>The Central Bank has made amendments to the consumer protection framework to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. </p><p>Following a public consultation in 2017, the Central Bank introduced changes to the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) by means of the Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (June 2018). The new and enhanced requirements took effect on 1 January 2019. The changes made to the Code are as follows:</p><p>- For consumers with fixed rate mortgages, regulated entities are required to inform their consumers at least 60 days in advance that they are about to come off their fixed rate and provide details of the new rate applicable from the expiry date. The regulated entity should provide information on other possible options that may be available to the consumer.</p><p>- For consumers on variable rate mortgages (other than on a tracker rate), regulated entities are required to notify consumers every year as to whether they can, or cannot, move to a cheaper interest rate as a result of a move in their Loan to Value interest rate band, subject to the provision of an up-to-date valuation and any other requirements that may apply.</p><p>-In relation to potential switching savings, regulated entities must provide, on request, an indicative comparison of the total interest payable on the consumer&rsquo;s existing mortgage and the interest payable on the new mortgage or alternative interest rate on offer by that regulated entity. Where the regulated entity provides this information, it must also provide a link to the relevant section of the CCPC&rsquo;s website to allow consumers to compare potential mortgage switching savings available from other lenders.</p><p>- The changes impose a time-bound mortgage application process on regulated entities, including  requirements to acknowledge receipt of a completed mortgage application  within three business days and make a decision within 10 business days following receipt of all required information for assessment of a mortgage application.</p><p>- In relation to incentives, the existing provision 6.12 in the Code has been extended to apply the same protections to all mortgage holders i.e. for new, existing and switching mortgage holders. This is to ensure that consumers have sufficient clarity about the precise nature and scale of the benefit of an incentive to them, including the potential impact of an associated incentive on the cost of their mortgage. </p><p>The Central Bank has also introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, and became effective in February 2017, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p></reply>

The tax credit is worth a maximum of &euro;125, or &euro;250 for a jointly assessed couple. The purpose of the scheme is to provide targeted support to businesses within the hospitality sector whose operations are likely to be most affected by continued restrictions.</p><p>To be eligible for the relief, claimants must upload their receipts on the Revenue Receipts Tracker App for all qualifying expenditure. Qualifying expenditure refers to expenditure of more than &euro;25 on holiday accommodation, and food and drink consumed on premises (excluding alcohol), provided by registered service providers.</p><p>The purpose of the Stay and Spend scheme is to provide targeted support to businesses within the hospitality sector whose operations are likely to be most affected by continued restrictions.  Food and drink service providers that operate on a take-away basis are not expected to be as heavily affected by the current restrictions as service providers offering &lsquo;dine-in&rsquo; food and drink services and so would not fall within the particular objectives of the scheme.</p><p>As I indicated when the scheme was launched, it was in the anticipation that the economy would be on the way to being fully open, and there would be mobility across our country. We know that this is not the case now.  As I have also indicated previously, I will continue to monitor the scheme to see how it works and to assess if there are any changes that we may need to make.</p><p>As the Deputies may be aware, the legislation governing the scheme affords me the flexibility to extend the operation of the scheme beyond its current planned end date of 30 April 2021.  Relevant issues in this regard may be considered in due course.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-17a.612.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111700074#WRM03300"><p>In relation to Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs), prior to Finance Act 1999, individuals with Defined Contribution (DC) pension savings had no option but to purchase a pension income or annuity with their savings after taking the allowable tax-free retirement lump sum.  Finance Act 1999 introduced flexibility and choice for certain individuals in relation to their pension savings and those flexible options at retirement have since been extended to all benefits from DC retirement benefit schemes and other DC pension savings. These arrangements are therefore of long-standing. </p><p>Choices which are now available to individuals in relation to their pension savings (after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum) include the option to purchase an annuity, if they so wish, to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to marginal rate tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions.</p><p>Under the regime, the options to invest in an ARF or receive the balance of the pension fund in cash are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed minimum level of pension income (&ldquo;specified income&rdquo;) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unrestricted access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement. The specified income requirement is &euro;12,700 per annum and this income requirement can be satisfied, in part at least, by the amount of the State pension in payment to an individual in his or her own right (for example, excluding any payment being received on behalf of a dependent). </p><p>Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount must be invested. The maximum amount of the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; is &euro;63,500 or the remaining pension fund amount, if lower, after taking the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum. The funds in an AMRF can be used at any point, in full or in part, to purchase an annuity, including an annuity sufficient to meet the minimum specified income requirement. </p><p>The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension &lsquo;safety-net&rsquo; to provide for the latter years of his/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, until recently, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate.  </p><p>My predecessor changed the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF-owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year until it becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.</p><p>Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at a maximum of &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy.  </p><p>The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime. </p><p>An AMRF will automatically become an ARF when an individual either becomes entitled to the required level of specified income at any time after exercising the ARF option, or when they reach the age of 75 years.</p><p>I have no plans to change these arrangements at present. </p><p>However, the Report of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform &amp;amp; Taxation Group was recently published on my Department&rsquo;s website which contains a discussion about AMRFs .</p><p>I am aware of the severe difficulties that individuals are facing during this unprecedented crisis and in response to that a very comprehensive package of measures has been put in place by the Government to assist those who have suffered a loss of income. This includes the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Re-Start Grants, Credit Guarantee Scheme, Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9%.</p></reply>

While this was a welcome initiative and it allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers, each individual&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others. </p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I met the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks and the Banking Payments Federation Ireland on 28 September and indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank that the vast majority of COVID-19 mortgage payment breaks have expired and that the lenders are engaging with borrowers who require additional support.  In that context the Central Bank has indicated that, as at the end of October, approximately 7,000 borrowers have been already been provided with additional financial support/forbearance or are completing an Standard Financial Statement (SFS)  to determine the most appropriate type of continued forbearance. This is based on an individual or case-by-case assessment by lenders of those borrowers&rsquo; financial circumstances following a request by the borrower. </p>  <p>  The Bank also advises that the number of borrowers in receipt of additional payment relief is set to increase as regulated firms continue to engage with borrowers and complete the SFS process with them. This is reflected in firms&rsquo; forecasts and operational planning and resourcing, as well as in their ongoing &lsquo;outreach&rsquo; activity designed to support as early borrower engagement as possible.   </p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why a request for additional mortgage payment relief does not proceed. These include:</p>  <p>  - the borrower does not wish to proceed once the impact on the overall/total cost is explained;</p>  <p>  - the SFS assessment concludes that it is in the borrowers best interests to now resume full repayments.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has said that the numbers of rejected requests are not reported as significant at this early stage but that it is an area of ongoing focus of supervisory engagement. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support due to the economic impact of COVID-19.</p></reply>

It was introduced as an emergency income support for employees of vulnerable firms (where turnover had reduced by at least 25% during Q2 while the strictest public health measures were in place) and was paid via the employer so as to maintain employment links between the employee and employer insofar as was possible.</p>  <p>  Since 1 September the EWSS has completely replaced the TWSS. The EWSS is an employer subsidy to help support viable firms and encourage employment. The level of subsidy given to the employer is based on the number of paid workers on the payroll per week, applying prospectively so that claims may be made for new hires and seasonal workers. Subject to the other relevant qualifying criteria being met, there is no restriction on persons who are over 70 in the application of the EWSS. The primary qualifying criteria for the EWSS is the &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; and has been specifically designed to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 by requiring a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations. The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  The employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.</p></reply>

I welcome this agreement and think this is a fair and balanced outcome and demonstrates that Europe can work collectively to deal with this once-in-a-generation crisis. </p>  <p>  That agreement included the introduction of a plastics-based own resource in 2021, along with the expectation that the Commission will put forward proposals on a digital levy and a carbon border adjustment in 2021 and on an amended Emissions Trading System, and that the Union would work towards other new own resources, possibly including a financial transactions tax.</p>  <p>  The agreement was then subject to discussions with the European Parliament with a view to securing its consent. The German Presidency of the Council of the EU on 10 November reached a political agreement with the European Parliament&rsquo;s negotiators in those talks. The deal will now be submitted to Member States for endorsement.</p>  <p>  Part of that agreement includes an indicative roadmap on the introduction of new own resources over the 2021 to 2027 period. This sets out that a plastics-based own resource will be introduced in 2021, and Commission proposals are expected in the coming years on own resources based on the Emissions Trading System, a carbon border adjustment mechanism, a digital levy, and possibly a financial transactions tax and/or a financial contribution linked to the corporate sector/new common corporate tax base.</p>  <p>  If and when such proposals are received, Ireland will consider them on their merits and engage in constructive negotiations in Council following the applicable procedures under the Treaties.</p></reply>

Work has begun to implement these.  In this regard, a Sub-Group of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment was established by Government to oversee insurance reform implementation, and held its first meeting on 30 September.  This is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and also includes as standing members, Ministers McGrath, McEntee, O&rsquo;Gorman and myself, together with Ministers of State Troy and Fleming.  I strongly believe this cross-departmental approach provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance and will build and expand upon previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which published its Eleventh and Final Progress Update report on 30 October. </p>  <p>  By way of update, a new insurance reform Action Plan is being developed which will outline a range of deliverables, including potential legislation where required in a number of Government Department policy areas, and will be published before the end of the year.  Work is already underway in relation to a number of areas, including: </p>  <p>  - increasing market transparency following the publication of the second private motor report of the National Claims Information Database (NCID), and the planned expansion of the scope of the NCID to include employer and public liability insurance; </p>  <p>  - reviewing duty of care legislation; </p>  <p>  - providing for the Judicial Council&rsquo;s accelerated adoption by 31 July 2021 of new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum; </p>  <p>  - consideration by the Department of Justice of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Capping Damages in Personal Injuries Actions, with a view to presenting options for progressing this by the end of the year; </p>  <p>  - looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; and,</p>  <p>  - making proposals on increasing competition in the Irish insurance market.  </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Sub-Group should be able to report on progress in relation to these before the end of this year.  In addition to this work, there has been a fresh round of intensive engagement with key stakeholders. In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has held meetings with the Alliance for Insurance Reform; the State Claims Agency; Insurance Ireland; Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance; the Central Bank of Ireland; and Brokers Ireland.  More recently, he has concluded a series of meetings with the main insurers in the Irish market.  It is also his intention to meet shortly with the Law Society of Ireland, the Bar Council of Ireland and MIBI.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of motor insurance premiums more specifically, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to data from the recently published second NCID Private Motor Insurance Report from the Central Bank. This shows that, after peaking in Q2 2018, the earned premium for private motor insurance decreased by 9 per cent up to the end of 2019.  I would reasonably expect that the next year&rsquo;s report will show further reductions in the average earned premiums for private motor insurance into 2020.  Separately, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in last week&rsquo;s October Consumer Price Index, the private motor insurance component shows that premiums have reduced by about 30 per cent from their July 2016 peak.  While for methodological reasons, these datasets are not directly comparable, both have indicated the same downward trend for some time. This reflects the positive work done by the CIWG, and it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to build on this success.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key priority issue for this Government.  Minister of State Fleming and my Department will continue to play a lead role in this policy area.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the Programme for Government which identifies a range of issues that need to be tackled on a Whole-of-Government basis, including inter alia: continued reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB); review of duty of care; the need to reduce award levels for general damages; and tackling fraud. I also look forward to the Judicial Council&rsquo;s Personal Injuries Guidelines being adopted and implemented by mid-2021. </p>  <p>  This ambitious reform agenda is being led by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment&rsquo;s sub-Group on Insurance Reform.  It is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and includes Minister Donohoe, Minister McGrath, Minister McEntee, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister of State Troy and myself as standing members.   I strongly believe this cross-departmental approach provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance and will build and expand upon previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which was established in July 2016 and produced two primary reports, the first on the cost of motor insurance and the second on the cost of employer and public liability insurance.  </p>  <p>  My Department published the CIWG&rsquo;s Eleventh and Final Progress Update Report on 30 October.  This showed that the vast majority of recommendations had been completed.  It was also noted that taking account of the new Whole-of-Government approach, that the outstanding CIWG recommendations will now be implemented through the Cabinet Committees Sub-Group on Insurance Reform.  In that context, the four outstanding recommendations from the CIWG&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, including the reason for their delay, are as follows:</p>  <p>  - Recommendation 16 &ndash; Ascertain and set out the measures necessary to implement Pre-Action Protocols (PAPs) for personal injury cases:  The Department of Justice has advised that draft regulations on PAPs for medical negligence actions remain under discussion with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC).  It has advised that they intend to move this work forward as a matter of urgency.  The finalisation of these Regulations will then inform the work on the PAPs for personal injuries actions.</p>  <p>  - Recommendation 22 &ndash; Examine the impact of legal and other fees on personal injury awards:  The implementation of this recommendation was contingent on the establishment of the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators (OLCA), as provided for under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. The OLCA came into operation with effect from 7 October 2019.  The Department of Justice has outlined that a period of at least one to two years from the time this new body became operational will be required before they will have an appropriate data baseline to commence a meaningful review.</p>  <p>  -Recommendation 24 &ndash; Examine the setting of the discount rate (in personal injury lump sum awards), without prejudice to the outcome of relevant proceedings, and to be reviewed at regular intervals:  The Department of Justice recently ran a public consultation and will provide a report once its review of the discount rate has concluded in the context of the new reform agenda.</p>  <p>  - Recommendation 25 &ndash; Establish a fully functioning integrated insurance fraud database for industry to detect patterns of fraud:  This recommendation has been delayed as a result of a number of data protection issues.  These are currently being examined by the Department of Justice and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these outstanding recommendations, the Deputy will be aware that many positive reforms have been introduced to address the cost and availability of insurance through the CIWG.  These include legislation to: strengthen the role of PIAB; to clarify and widen the role of the Insurance Compensation Fund; to provide access to information regarding claims; to provide more information to consumers at renewal; and to make it easier for businesses to challenge fraudulent claims.  The cumulative impact of these changes has undoubtedly been a factor in helping to reduce motor premiums over the last number of years. The most recent CSO data indicates that the cost of motor insurance is now almost a third lower than it was at its peak in July 2016.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, the CIWG&rsquo;s remaining recommendations will be part of the Cabinet Sub-group&rsquo;s work.  The Deputy can rest assured that seeking to secure sustainable competition through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland is a key priority issue for the new Government and that Minister of State Fleming and I will play a lead role to ensure that progress is made in this policy area.</p></reply>

If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked about civil servants who retired at the maximum of the Assistant Principal (AP) grade. In the response, it is necessary to distinguish between those who retired before 1 March 2012 and those who retired after that date.</p>  <p>  Generally, individuals who retired pre-March 2012 will have retired either before imposition of the first FEMPI pay reduction in 2010 or were protected by the first 'grace period' so their pension does not reflect this reduction. APs in this cohort who retired on the maximum point of the scale are not eligible for pension increases arising from PSSA increases to serving staff as the salary on which their pension is based is still higher than the salary of serving staff on the same grade/scale point. </p>  <p>  Individuals who retired from 1 March 2012 onwards retired either before the second round of FEMPI reductions were imposed in July 2013, were not affected by this second round of reductions as it only applied to salaries above &euro;65,000, or the salary on which their pension is based does not reflect these reductions as a result of the second 'grace period'. However, given that the salary on which their pension is based encompasses the first FEMPI reduction in 2010, this cohort of retirees are generally eligible for pension increases arising from PSSA pay increases as their pensionable salary will be lower than the salary of serving staff, following each of those pay increases.</p>  <p>  The National Shared Services Offices, which administers the civil service pension schemes, has confirmed that the majority of individuals who retired at AP grade from the civil service, and who were eligible for a pension increase on 1 October 2020 have had this increase passed on to them, with a very small number of more complex outstanding cases currently being reviewed.</p></reply>

The Circular highlights the potential for Departments to support wider social and environmental aims through public procurement. The Circular provides a clear signal of the direction of travel towards greener public procurement. The Circular also requires Departments to incorporate relevant green procurement measures into their planning and reporting cycles, with reporting arrangements due to commence this year. An Annual Report template is due to be published by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment this year and each Department is required to report annually on progress in relation to Green Public Procurement starting with the 2020 Annual Report.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Office of Government Procurement published an Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement in December 2018 and chairs a cross-departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group to bring together officials from policy Departments with procurement practitioners to share best practice and to facilitate the process of incorporating social and environmental considerations into public procurement.</p></reply>

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works &euro;1 billion flood relief investment programme, and on completion will protect 236 properties in the town.</p>  <p>  The Scheme requires formal Confirmation from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER) to proceed. This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts, which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme. This involves, inter alia, a formal review by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR), along with a Natura Impact Statement, as part of the formal Confirmation process.</p>  <p>  The statutory public consultation period required in relation to this process ran from July 28th to August 28th. The initial phase of the EIAR and NIS reviews were carried out by consultants engaged for this purpose by DPER, during September and early October. On foot of submissions from the public consultation and the EIAR and NIS reviews, DPER have issued a Request for Further Information to the OPW for reply, pursuant to ADA regulations 2019, to ensure that the design of the scheme complies with relevant environmental directives and regulations.  The OPW, Wexford County Council, and Mott Mc Donald consultants are currently reviewing the material received from DPER and will formally respond to the points raised by the review of the scheme by DPER and their consultants. As the review of the material has not yet been completed it is not possible to provide an accurate timeline for response. Completion of the above tasks and the progression of the flood relief scheme is a priority for all parties.</p></reply>

The scheme was originally part of the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme.  As it became clear, however, that a solution could be advanced for Blackpool ahead of the Lower Lee, a separate scheme was developed for Blackpool. Following extensive engineering and environmental analysis, public consultation, and a formal Public Exhibition, the proposed scheme was submitted to the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform for Ministerial Confirmation. </p>  <p>The Scheme and the associated environmental assessments are currently being reviewed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as part of the Confirmation process under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  Further information was requested by the Minister as part of the environmental impact assessment he is required to carry out on the scheme.  This information was provided to the Minister on the 2nd November 2020 and it is anticipated, pending a review of the further information supplied, that a grant of Ministerial Confirmation for the scheme will be received in early 2021. Once the scheme is Confirmed, the detailed design will be completed and a tender competition held to appoint a works contractor.  It is currently anticipated that construction of the scheme will commence by mid 2021.</p>  <p>  In terms of the &lsquo;flood attenuation lake&rsquo; as referred to by the Deputy, which is understood to relate to the Blackpool Retail and Amenity Park, this has not been included as part of the proposed Blackpool Flood Relief Scheme. This is believed to relate to the granting of planning permission for the Blackpool Retail and Amenity Park, which is outside the remit of the Office of Public Works. The relevant planning authority should be contacted regarding any further information on same in that case.</p></reply>

These measures continue to be in place for all public expenditure, including core expenditure as well as additional expenditure allocated as part of the response to Covid-19. As is usual, my Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that all expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels. </p>  <p>  In terms of other EU jurisdictions, in the five years prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, Irish General Government expenditure as a proportion of GNI* had moved to be broadly in line with the EU average figures for General Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP. In terms of capital expenditure, the overall public capital allocation set out in the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume was &euro;8.2 billion. At this level, core gross voted capital investment in 2020 was projected to reach c. 4 percent of national income (GNI*) compared to an EU average in recent years of 2.9 percent (GDP). While these indicators have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, they give an indication of Ireland&rsquo;s position relative to other EU countries in terms of core expenditure. </p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-October 2020 was &euro;65,547 million. This is &euro;8,604 million, or 15.1% ahead of profile. It should be noted however, that expenditure profiles for the year were published in February and are based on the expenditure allocations set out in the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume. This means that the impact of additional resources allocated in respect of Covid-19 are not reflected in these profiles. As such, spending can be expected to run significantly ahead of profile for the remainder of the year. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;60,000 million, is &euro;8,662 million, or 16.9% above profile. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;5,547 million, is &euro;58 million, or 1% below profile and up &euro;886 million, or 19% on October 2019.  </p>  <p>  The vast majority of identified overruns in 2020 to date relate to expenditure allocated in response to Covid-19. Current expenditure in the Department of Health is ahead of profile by &euro;1.36 billion at end October 2020. This is due to the drawdown of funds to the HSE, to support maximising capacity within the system and to allow for the purchase of necessary equipment such as PPE. The Department of Social Protection is ahead of profile by almost &euro;6.9 billion at this point in the year. This is due to payments introduced in respect of Covid-19 to support employees and businesses. There is a Covid-19 related impact on the Department of Transport, for which current expenditure is &euro;307 million ahead of profile at end October. This is due to the drop in passenger numbers and associated revenue as a result of public health measures. </p>  <p>  Gross voted current expenditure in Education is ahead of profile by &euro;83 million. This relates to higher than anticipated drawdown in relation to teacher salaries and pensions, as well as payment of &euro;66 million in Covid-19 grants to primary and post-primary schools in August. In terms of core current spending, expenditure on Asylum Seekers Accommodation is over profile by approximately &euro;74 million at end-October due to underlying financial pressures, linked to the numbers to be accommodated.  Expenditure has also been impacted by the Covid-19 emergency, with additional measures being implemented including the provision of self-isolation facilities.</p>  <p>  Looking at capital expenditure, the impact of Covid-19 can also be seen. Of the 16 vote groups which have capital allocations, 12 are below profile for capital expenditure at this point in the year. Capital expenditure in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is ahead of profile for end-October by &euro;587 million. This relates to the additional funding which was allocated in light of the impact of Covid-19 on businesses. The Department of Education is ahead of profile on capital expenditure by &euro;91 million. The main driver of this is the issuing of additional minor works grants in light of Covid-19, as well as bringing these grants forward to July and August for primary and post-primary schools. &euro;10 million has also been provided for Student Devices.</p>  <p>  The Government has allocated significant additional resources to Departments in response to Covid-19. Expenditure Report 2021 set out total gross voted expenditure of &euro;87.1 billion for 2020, with additional expenditure of &euro;16.7 billion primarily driven by Covid-19. These allocations are being made in the usual way, with Estimates agreed by Government and voted on by the D&aacute;il. A number of Revised Estimates and Further Revised Estimates have been approved by the D&aacute;il in recent weeks and months to give effect to these increased allocations for 2020. A number of Supplementary Estimates have also been presented to the D&aacute;il in the last number of weeks and work is currently ongoing to agree the last number of Supplementary Estimates for 2020.  </p></reply>

A core goal of this Department is to continue to deliver improved, cost-effective public services across a range of areas in the Public Service, including governance, accountability, procurement, shared services, organisational redesign and property management. </p>  <p>  The current framework for public service reform and innovation, Our Public Service 2020 (OPS2020), builds on earlier reforms while expanding their scope in order to accelerate the digital delivery of public services, deliver better outcomes for citizens, drive innovation and develop our people and organisations. </p>  <p>  Notable examples of initiatives that have being delivered include:</p>  <p>  - Transforming and driving Digital Delivery of Services, such as, for example, An Garda Siochana&rsquo;s Active Mobility Service; Passport on-line; Library Service&rsquo;s My Open Library initiative; Revenue Commissioners PAYE Modernisation programme;</p>  <p>  - The Civil Service Renewal Programme; </p>  <p>  - Innovation: A &euro;1m Innovation Fund has been established to support Public Service innovation projects; the establishment of a central Innovation Support Team; creation of a Public-Service wide Innovation Network and a Public-Service wide Innovation Week (held most recently on 19-23 October 2020); and the publication of a National Innovation Strategy, launched just last week, which focuses on making our public services more efficient and effective for the citizen. </p>  <p>  - Driving the take-up of Robotic Process Automation through the dedicated Procurement Framework, which enables swift and easy draw down of licences, supports and expertise to create efficiencies in back-office functions;</p>  <p>  - A significant strategic workforce planning initiative commenced in selected public service organisations; </p>  <p>  - An initiative to support greater diversity and inclusion in our Public Service;</p>  <p>  - Creation of a Public Service Leadership Board (PSLB) - at Secretary General equivalent level- supported by the Public Service Management Group (PSMG) to oversee the governance of reform efforts.</p>  <p>  Innovations and reforms are also underway outside of the OPS2020 framework in organisations across the civil and public services. For example, the  programme of reforms set out in the 2014 Civil Service Renewal Plan to support a higher performing organisation continues to be embedded within the Civil Service. A number of budgetary reforms have also been introduced in recent years to guide Minster&rsquo;s decisions on overall fiscal policy, including fiscal rules, new spending code, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews. </p>  <p>  My Department has now begun consultations on developing a successor framework to OPS2020 and similar work is well-advanced in framing a further renewal plan for the Civil Service and an examination of the organisational structure and design of our Civil Service to 2030.  The vision and strategy underpinning these reform priorities will focus on large-scale ambitious transformation to support greater cost-effectiveness through enhanced digital service delivery; developing our data infrastructure, and; building the workforce and workplace of the future following the extraordinary changes that are occurring as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease.

These include income supports, loans, grants, vouchers and schemes, rates waiver and tax measures as well as skills and training supports. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has a Business Support Call Centre for information on the supports available to businesses and enterprises affected by COVID-19 at +353 1 631 2002 or infobusinesssupport@dbei.gov.ie.</p><p>Businesses, including circuses, may qualify for the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the government, at Level 3 or higher, under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  It is designed to assist those businesses whose trade has been significantly impacted or temporarily closed as a result of the restrictions as set out in the government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan.  The scheme applies to businesses where government restrictions prohibit or reduce access by customers to their business premises.  Other features of the scheme are as follows: </p><p>- qualifying businesses can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a cash payment in respect of an advance credit for trading expenses for the period of the restrictions;</p><p>- to  qualify under the scheme, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the COVID-19 restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim  is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made;</p><p>- the scheme will operate from 13 October 2020 to 31 March 2021 and there is provision for the Minister for Finance to vary aspects of the scheme by Ministerial Order; and</p><p>- the Revenue Commissioners have published an overview of the scheme with some detailed examples, together with guidance on the operation of the scheme on www.Revenue.ie.</p><p>In Budget 2021, the Government announced the provision of support of &euro;50m for the live entertainment sector.  This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country.  The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders.It will also be informed by a pilot Live Performance Support Scheme now rolled out, to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances to provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. </p><p>Earlier in the autumn, a project called the Music Industry Stimulus Package was managed on behalf of my Department by First Music Contact.  The Package was targeted at professional musicians and their teams to support song-writing camps, recording and album releases.

The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.</p>  <p>   While I am pleased to note that COVID-19 data indicates improvements across a range of indicators, which gives us hope that the epidemiological situation is once again coming under control, it is too early at this point to consider the easing of restrictions, including those currently applying to swimming pools. </p></reply>

The purpose of this funding is to support performers, technical staff, crew other support staff who have been severely impacted by the current public health crisis.

In addition, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is available to all employees and the self-employed who have lost their job due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  There are also a range of loans, grants, vouchers and schemes available including the  COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme which offers loans  from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1 million, for terms of up to five and a half years, and COVID-19 Business Loans of up to &euro;25,000 which are available through Microfinance Ireland with zero repayments and zero interest for the first 6 months and the equivalent of an additional 6 months interest-free subject to certain terms and conditions.

COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. The risk of infection spread is greater in certain environments than others e.g. uncontrolled environments, crowded and noisy places, indoor environments, poorly ventilated spaces.</p>  <p>  Given the current epidemiological situation with high incidence of disease, widespread community transmission, and high numbers of both hospitalisations and deaths, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of the disease and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including indoor sports training and exercise.</p>  <p>  Currently, in Level 5 sporting competition is not permitted except for defined exempted athletes and teams, as set out in the public health regulations. In addition to this, non-contact outdoor sports training, including athletics, is permitted for school aged children in pods of up to 15. It is not currently permitted to open gyms, swimming pools or leisure centres.</p>  <p>  I recognise that there is great disappointment among those who wish to engage in sport indoors around the current restrictions. While I am pleased to note that COVID-19 data indicates improvements across a range of indicators, which gives us hope that the epidemiological situation is once again coming under control, it is too early at this point to consider the easing of restrictions. </p></reply>

The public health risk at level 5 means that we are all asked to stay at home, with limited exceptions.  Information on the public health measures currently in place in relation to the different Levels can be found at www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/</p>  <p>  The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A-Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.8) Regulations 2020 give effect to Level 5 restrictions under the Plan.  The Regulations list essential retail and essential services which may operate under Level 5 restrictions.  This list does not include private or commercial dance classes.  Under Part 2 of the schedule to the Regulations, essential education encompasses primary and post-primary schools, and higher and further education where remote learning is not possible. Where a service provider considers that they fall into the essential education category e.g. as part of the national curriculum or as part of a specific, state-sponsored course of study, they should refer to the Department of Education&rsquo;s guidance in relation to the operation of education services under Level 5 restrictions. </p>  <p>  Similarly, The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.7) Regulations, which applied when the country was under Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, did not allow any exercise or dance classes, regardless of the form e.g. Irish, ballet, jazz etc.  The only exceptions to this are for individual training or for classes to take place outdoors with a maximum of 15 people attending.  It should also be noted that the regulations specifically prohibit the opening of dance studios, other than insofar as they provide gymnasium facilities for use by persons taking exercise on an individual basis. Gyms were also allowed to provide for individual training only under the No. 7 Regulations, they were not allowed to run exercise or dance classes.</p>  <p>  At present the Government has made no decision regarding which level or particular restrictions will apply after 1 December as that will depend on the epidemiological situation at the time.  The impact of any and all restrictions for every sector, including dance, will be considered carefully as the Government seeks to balance the public health risk posed by COVID with economic, social and wellbeing considerations.</p></reply>

This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including sporting activity.</p>  <p>  Currently, in Level 5 sporting competition is not permitted except for defined exempted athletes and teams, as set out in the public health regulations. In addition to this, non-contact outdoor sports training, including athletics, is permitted for school aged children in pods of up to 15. Other members of the community are asked to exercise alone or with members of their household, within 5km of their homes.</p>  <p>  While I am pleased to note that COVID-19 data indicates improvements across a range of indicators, which gives us hope that the epidemiological situation is once again coming under control, it is too early at this point to consider the easing of restrictions. </p>  <p>  While the Government fully understands the benefits that sport brings to peoples overall health and well-being, the measures in place to suppress the disease transmission are intended to minimise the risks to public health while striking the right balance in prioritising and protecting some activities over others. Such activities include health and social care services, education and other essential needs, work and economic activity, and other key societal interests (in so far as possible) such as sporting activity and family gatherings.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The reason for the limited number of exclusions is to recognise that there is a small number of ratepayers whose businesses have not been affected by the pandemic, these ratepayers will not be eligible for the automatic waiver.  However, in acknowledgement that some ratepayers in the excluded categories may have closed during the period of the public health restrictions or been otherwise adversely affected, funding is being provided for ratepayers in these categories who can demonstrate that the pandemic has had a significant negative impact on their business.  Any ratepayers negatively impacted as such, have been invited to engage with their own local authorities in relation to their commercial rates on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

This was to ensure that local authority members, in line with their statutory responsibilities, could make informed decisions on LPT variation by the end of September deadline.  Taking account of those local variation decisions, local authorities were notified last month of their LPT allocations for 2021, amounting to &euro;530m.

Separate town councils are not provided for under the Act. Municipal districts are a key decision-making component, with specified reserved powers, of plenary councils and each municipal district can include several towns and their hinterlands.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to ensuring a strong voice for towns at the heart of local authority decision making. It also commits to considering the review by the Institute of Public Administration regarding the role and operation of municipal districts with a view to strengthening local democracy and to identifying local needs and initiatives needed to strengthen and grow our communities, villages and towns in a sustainable manner. </p><p>This review, which was published on 25 June 2020, is available on the Institute's website at .</p><p>Prior to the 2014 Reform Act, qualified electors of a town, having a population of at least 7,500, could petition their County Council and the Local Government Commission to recommend that the Minister establish a new Town Council under the criteria set out in the Local Government Act, 2001. However, these provisions are no longer in force and the strategic focus is to achieve a stronger, more effective and more responsive local government system. The municipal district model is a key element of this, as an innovative system of sub-county governance designed to strengthen local government, through more effective local community-focused decision making and democratic accountability and representation. Subsidiarity is thereby enhanced while, at the same time, achieving the benefits of greater integration, such as the removal of duplication, the reduction of corporate overhead, a more integrated administration and more effective local government generally. </p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. </p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. </p>  <p>  Once a dwelling is included in the Scheme, the cost of testing, damage verification, professional services and remediation works are borne by the Scheme. A scheme participant may recoup the vouched cost of the Building Condition Assessment, subject to a maximum limit of &euro;500 (including VAT). This may be recouped from the Housing Agency once the dwelling is approved for inclusion in the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The vouched cost of the alternative accommodation, required for the dwelling occupants during the remediation works, can be recouped by the scheme participant. Recoupment of the vouched cost is subject to a monthly maximum limit of &euro;1,500 (including VAT) and an overall limit of &euro;4,500 (including VAT) per dwelling.</p>  <p>  The vouched costs in relation to the removal, storage and return of the furniture in the dwelling, equipment and effects can be recouped by the scheme participant, subject to a maximum limit of &euro;2,500 (including VAT) per dwelling.</p>  <p>  Where the scheme participant satisfies the Housing Agency in advance that suitable rental accommodation cannot be obtained for &euro;4,500 or less, the alternative accommodation and the removal and storage expenses may be combined, but are subject to an overall limit of &euro;7,000 (including VAT).</p>  <p>  The average all-in cost of remediation in 2019 was &euro;65,000 per dwelling. There can be significant variation in costs, with one-off houses generally having larger ground floor areas being the most expensive.</p></reply>

From this sum, &euro;110 million was ring-fenced for a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme and a new<b></b>Cost Rental Equity Loan facility<b></b>to help deliver Cost Rental homes. Both of these programmes will begin in 2021. </p><p>&euro;75 million will be allocated to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme. I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage. </p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme. </p><p>In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) facility to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver approximately 350 Cost Rental homes at scale from next year.  Added to the 50 Cost Rental homes that will be delivered in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside in Q3 2021, it will accelerate delivery in this new sector in advance of the Land Development Agency's planned future output and the work of local authorities. This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units. </p><p>The CREL scheme will see financing made available to AHBs on favourable terms to cover 30% of the costs for Cost Rental homes. CREL funding will be provided on similar terms to the existing Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) model which is extensively used by AHBs for social housing. In terms of the remaining 70% of capital costs, subject to appropriate conditions, it is anticipated that long term competitive financing will be made available to the AHBs by the Housing Finance Agency. This will allow cost-covering rents to be set at a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants. Further details on the scheme will be announced in due course. </p><p>I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill which will be brought to Government in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Where the household is deemed qualified for support it is placed on the housing authority&rsquo;s waiting list, and offers of suitable accommodation are made in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme as they arise.</p>  <p>  The allocation scheme is made by the elected members under section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and in compliance with Social Housing Allocation Regulations made thereunder, and specifies, among other things, the manner of, and the order of priority for, the allocation of dwellings to households on the housing and transfer lists. Under section 22, an allocation scheme shall apply to dwellings owned or under the control of a local authority, as well as dwellings provided by approved housing bodies (AHBs) with Exchequer funding.</p>  <p>  Where a vacancy arises in a dwelling owned by an AHB, the relevant local authority may nominate suitable households from its housing or transfer list to that body, having regard to the order of priority set out in its allocation scheme.  </p>  <p>  Such nomination rights are linked to the provision of funding by my Department under its capital and current funding schemes for social housing. The rules in this regard are set down in my Department's memorandum on Capital Funding Schemes for the Provision of Rental Accommodation by Approved Housing Bodies (Voluntary and Co - Operative Rental Housing) of May 2002, and related circulars, and the relevant Payment and Availability Agreements in force.  AHBs may also, in consultation with the relevant local authority, make their own nominations for a proportion of tenancies in accordance with the relevant funding rules for tenancies in a housing project funded under a capital scheme.</p>  <p>  AHBs are independent, not for profit organisations. Those AHBs that are signed up to the Voluntary Regulation Code (which includes all the large and growth AHBs ) must abide by the Code and associated standards. One such standard is the Performance Standard which sets out that AHBs are expected to have tenant service policies and management procedures establishing the roles and responsibilities of both the tenant and the landlord throughout the life of the tenancy agreement, from commencement to termination.</p>  <p>  If an AHB is in receipt of funding under a relevant Exchequer funding scheme, they must comply with the terms and conditions of that scheme. Under such funding schemes (made available through local authorities), the AHB is required to make the property available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the governing board of an individual AHB to determine how property, which is solely owned by the AHB without any mortgage or debt funding in place, is allocated to tenants in accordance with their constitution. All AHB tenancies are registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and therefore this channel should be the primary recourse in terms of procedures in any tenant/landlord matters.</p></reply>

The emergency measures aimed to assist in restricting the movement of people to suppress the spread of Covid-19 and applied to all tenants, irrespective of their financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 came into effect from 1 August 2020 to provide enhanced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears due to Covid-19 and, as a result, are at risk of losing their tenancy.</p>  <p>  If a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020.  Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords.</p>  <p>  This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears.  The Guidance document is available on the Department's website - www.housing.gov.ie - and on the RTB's website - www.rtb.ie.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies  Act 2020  was enacted and came into operation on 24 October 2020 to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on tenants and to support the efforts of Government in restricting the movement of people in order to suppress the spread of Covid 19. The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence.</p>  <p>  Guidance and Frequently Asked Questions documents - Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants is available on the RTB&rsquo;s website - www.rtb.ie.</p>  <p>  No part of the duration of:</p>  <p>  (i) the emergency period from 27 March to 1 August 2020 under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020;</p>  <p>  (ii) the emergency period from 1 August 2020 to 10 January 2021 for tenants in rent arrears who make the necessary declaration under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020; or</p>  <p>  (iii) any emergency period under the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 (the current emergency period commenced on 22 October 2020 and is expected to expire on 1 December 2020) shall count for the purposes of a tenancy termination notice period given by a landlord in accordance with Table 1 of section 66 of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020. The Residential Tenancies Act 2020 also provides a grace period of 10 days further notice at the end of any emergency period under that Act which similarly, does not count towards the original notice period given by the landlord.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan 2018-2027 provides for significant investment in public water and wastewater infrastructure over the course of the plan to ensure the continued operation, repair and upgrading of Ireland&rsquo;s water and waste water infrastructure to support social and economic development across the State and continued care of the water environment.  Investment in waste water infrastructure is prioritised in the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan and it is estimated that &euro;1.9bn will be invested in waste water projects from 2019 to 2024.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.</p>  <p>  The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for homeless services is in place nationally, and is designed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided.</p>  <p>  Monitoring and inspection of services is an important element of the Framework. The Framework is consistent with Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) standards and seeks to ensure levels of quality in the provision of temporary accommodation and related services for homeless persons. The standards give service providers a framework for continuous quality improvement in their services.  Local authorities undertake monitoring and review activities to assure that services are operating effectively. It is matter for the local authorities to ensure compliance with the standards, including through the contractual arrangements and service level agreements in place with partner organisations.</p>  <p>  Local authorities carry out inspections on facilities that are not covered under the Framework, as they determine to be appropriate. The Standards and Facilities Teams in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) oversee all emergency accommodation and seek to ensure that all relevant guidelines, policies and procedures are complied with in order to deliver a safe and comfortable place to stay for service users. The DRHE has an inspection regime in place to deal with complaints and to ensure accommodation is appropriate and safe. This includes engaging with homeless families and individuals on issues arising in their accommodation.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I understand that since January 2020, the DRHE has carried out 126 unannounced night inspections of privately operated emergency accommodation facilities.  This monitoring work is ongoing to ensure the health and safety of the clients who are using the facilities.</p>  <p>  Guidelines for Service Users in Emergency Accommodation were recently reviewed by the DRHE and issued to clients in private emergency accommodation. The DRHE has assured me that it has a thorough complaints procedure in place, and that each complaint is fully investigated and addressed in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Separate to the service standards expected of providers via service level agreements, all homeless service providers must meet the requirements of statutory codes, in particular the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Fire Services Acts.</p></reply>

The report makes a number of recommendations regarding the recruitment of staff to the EU&rsquo;s Institutions. Recruitment to the EU institutions is carried out centrally by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO). EPSO regularly runs open competitions to recruit generalist and specialist EU civil servants.</p>  <p>  It has become clear in recent years that there will soon be a significant reduction in the number of Irish officials in senior roles in the EU Institutions, as many high-ranking Irish officials will soon retire. At the current rates of recruitment of permanent staff, we are far below the replacement rate. This poses a serious challenge.</p>  <p>  Significant work has been carried out by my Department to increase Ireland&rsquo;s representation in the staffing of the EU&rsquo;s Institutions, though it is clear that more needs to be done in this area. The Programme for Government commits to the development of a new strategy to increase the presence of Irish people in the senior ranks of the EU Institutions. We will also aim to increase the number of young Irish people applying for traineeships in the EU&rsquo;s Institutions.</p>  <p>  The new strategy will take into account any future changes to the EU&rsquo;s recruitment processes, and the actions taken to promote EU careers and assist Irish candidates for EU jobs will also adapt to any changes that occur.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the new EU Jobs strategy was launched by Minister for European Affairs Thomas Byrne T.D. in October and closed on 5 November.  I would like to thank all who contributed to this consultation.  Work on the development of the strategy has begun and I expect the new strategy to be published in early 2021.</p></reply>

In 2019, approximately 76%, that is &euro;295 million, of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral allocable aid contributed to gender equality.  Of this, over &euro;15 million was invested in actions to mitigate or prevent gender-based violence, or in support of those who have suffered from GBV.</p>  <p>  One of the many impacts COVID-19 pandemic has been an increased incidence of GBV worldwide, including in places where Irish Aid is working.  Irish Embassies in partner countries have used Irish Aid funding to ensure continuity of essential services to victims of domestic violence.  For example, in Zambia, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, Irish Aid is supporting partners to expand emergency shelter services and one-stop centres, and to establish rapid referral systems.  Irish Aid&rsquo;s work at community level also focuses on prevention, and safe spaces for adolescent girls who are out of school.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides annual funding to the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women, supporting efforts to address GBV at grassroots level in over 80 countries. My officials have been working closely with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to ensure that GBV is adequately addressed within the UN&rsquo;s Global COVID-19 Humanitarian Response Plan.</p>  <p>  Recognising that GBV is often a feature of emergencies, we have worked to reflect this in Irish Aid&rsquo;s response to humanitarian crises.  This includes ongoing work with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to deliver life-saving services for survivors of GBV internally displaced in Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Cameroon.</p></reply>

Research and dialogue will be at the centre of the Shared Island initiative.  The Government will seek a broad base of contributions from across society on this island, and work to ensure that people who have been proportionally under-represented in the Peace Process, such as women and new communities on the island, are fully represented.</p>  <p>  In October, the Shared Island Dialogue Series was launched to promote constructive and inclusive dialogue around the future of the island. The Dialogue series will start later this month and will focus on key sectoral issues including environment, economy, health and education. It will also engage on an inclusive basis on overarching concerns for the Good Friday Agreement, including around issues like identity rights and the equality agenda.</p>  <p>  The Shared Island initiative involves a renewed focus on harnessing the potential of the Agreement to deliver tangible improvements and to deepen reconciliation. The work programme to be delivered by the Shared Island Unit will operate alongside the work of my Department, importantly including the work of my Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund.</p>  <p>  The Reconciliation Fund awards funding to non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community groups, and voluntary organisations to support reconciliation and to create better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain. The projects supported seek to reach a broad range of communities and geographical locations in Northern Ireland, while also supporting the building and strengthening of links between North and South. Projects involving the border counties and the needs of minority communities in border areas are given high priority. A key aim of the Fund is to support initiatives that can increase understanding, respect and tolerance between people from different communities and traditions across the island. Many of the projects that we fund facilitate dialogue, not only in relation to past experiences of conflict but also looking ahead to explore perspectives on the future of the island. The objectives of the Reconciliation Fund are therefore fully complementary to those of the Shared Island initiative.</p></reply>

Though the recent hostilities have now ended, they had a devastating impact on local civilian populations. The destruction of essential services during the conflict, including hospitals and utility networks poses a serious, protracted risk to those in the region. Ensuring access for humanitarian organisations must be a top priority to avoid further catastrophe, particularly as we head into  winter. Ireland and the EU will do all we can to help bring about a sustainable and lasting peace and we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance. In that regard, we note the key role that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will continue to play.</p>  <p>  Currently the ICRC is the only international humanitarian organisation effectively present across the region with a physical presence in Nagorno Karabakh. Their role in this crisis is critical: they are providing assistance to displaced persons, engaging in dialogues with relevant authorities on international humanitarian law and protection issues and acting as a neutral intermediary for the recovery of human remains and prisoner exchanges.

Armed men in military-style attire fired towards a group of protesters in the Lekki area of Lagos, using live ammunition. The number of casualties remains unclear, but reports have claimed that at least 12 people were killed.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with the European Union, believes that it is essential that the events of 20 October are thoroughly investigated and that those responsible are held to account.  This echoes the calls by UN Secretary General and the African Union for a speedy investigation and for an end to reported police brutality and abuses.</p>  <p>  The protests, which took place in a number of cities including Abuja and Lagos, were in reaction to allegations of excessive use of force and abuses committed by a unit of the Nigerian police, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police unit.  While the protests were largely peaceful, they came against a background of unrest.</p>  <p>  Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced on 12 October that the SARS police unit would be disbanded, one of the main requests made by protesters. However, it was perceived that the unit would continue under another name and the protests persisted, with wider calls for reform and an end to police violence and corruption. The Nigerian army has denied opening fire on civilians on 20 October.</p>  <p>  President Buhari gave an Address to the Nation on 22 October, setting set out a number of steps his Government intends to take, including: the establishment of judicial panels of inquiry; the establishment of human rights complaint mechanisms; and the establishment of a fund for the compensation of victims. I look forward to the timely implementation of these potentially significant measures, which have helped calm the situation.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Abuja continues to monitor developments actively on the ground and, working closely with our EU partners, to engage with the Nigerian authorities.</p></reply>

The White Paper on Defence &ndash; Update 2019, which was published in December 2019 following Government approval, is the first in a new fixed cycle of defence reviews which the Government decided to introduce when it approved the White Paper in 2015.  The Update follows the approach set out in the White Paper.  It provides that these reviews are to consider progress made since 2015 and any revisions required.  Further, these reviews are to encompass a fully updated assessment of the security environment with a fresh consideration of implications for overall policy requirements, associated tasks, capability development and resourcing.</p><p>Implementation of all actions and projects is being carried out by civil-military teams on a phased basis over a ten-year period out to 2025 and is receiving continuous joint civil/military oversight of progress. All of the actions or projects are being implemented in addition to the substantial body of work conducted by the civil and military elements of the Department of Defence on a daily basis. </p><p>As part of this, the Update includes a comprehensive review of overall progress with White Paper implementation. Since publication of the White Paper, a total of 95 separate projects have been identified for completion over a ten-year period.  Included in the Update is a full breakdown of the current status of all projects and actions as well as a full report, on a chapter by chapter basis, of the outcome of the review of implementation.  (The Update is available to download on my Department&rsquo;s website.)  </p><p>To provide flexibility, projects may be sub-divided or merged, changing the top-line number. Currently, the total number of projects stands at 95, with this number subject to further change as the process evolves.  42 of these projects have been initiated with 20 closed and a number of others due to close shortly.  Following on from the White Paper Update and the Government&rsquo;s High Level Plan to implement the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission senior civil and military management are concluding a review of the projects which will result in reprioritisation of certain projects.  This takes account of work that is progressing across the organisation which has been contributing to implementation of the White Paper.</p><p>Implementation on a phased basis is necessary in order to reflect Programme for a Partnership Government and Strategy Statement commitments, the related nature of some projects and resourcing implications. The Table below reflects the current situation: <table>    <tr>       <th>No. of Projects Underway</th>       <th>No. of Projects not yet Commenced</th>       <th>No. of Projects Completed</th>       <th>No. of Projects Paused</th>       <th>Timeframe for Completion</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>42</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2025*</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The 42 White Paper projects initiated comprehend a huge body of work.  Taken with the extensive actions in the HR area, very significant progress has been made across all defence priorities.  I will be working to advance this even further.  While it is currently intended to have all projects initiated or completed by the end of the ten year implementation programme, work in certain areas will continue beyond 2025 in order to ensure that changes, improvements and actions envisaged in the White Paper are sustained and that the positive outcomes endure and are embedded in the day to day business of the Defence Organisation.</p></reply>

This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. The equipment planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology, including communications equipment and technology and this is an ongoing process. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the military authorities that General Routine Order 05/2015 &lsquo;Health and Safety Management in the Defence Forces&rsquo; sets out the Defence Forces health and safety risk management system, which is designed to control risk and continually improve health and safety risk performance through proactive and effective health and safety risk management. The arrangements, systems and risk controls are based on legislative requirements and the risks identified within the Defence Forces. The health and safety risk management system includes a policy on work equipment.</p>  <p>  This policy on health and safety of work equipment describes the Defence Forces methodology for the assessment of risk arising from work equipment. It provides guidance for military personnel, civilian employees and other relevant persons on the risk assessment process and control measures to be implemented to reduce the risk of injury from work equipment to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Defence Forces have the necessary policies and procedures in place in line with best international practice in order to ensure the highest standards of health and safety in respect of the use of equipment to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government, and that such policies and procedures are kept under review.</p></reply>

Leadership Training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations. Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills. Career Training, and education, provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements. A long-term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons set out to 2021. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms of the organisation against best military and academic practice. Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners. Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces deliver military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards and engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retain currency with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to ensuring that all personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be trained to appropriate standards.</p></reply>

As of 30 September 2020, the combined strength of the AR and NSR is 1,624 personnel and the FLR had a strength of 281 personnel. </p><p>The primary function of training and education in both the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) and the RDF is to develop and maintain capabilities necessary to fulfil the roles laid down by Government. The White Paper on Defence sets out a developmental path for the Reserve and confirms that the primary role of the Reserve is to augment the PDF in crisis situations. As such, the RDF undertakes training in preparation to assist the PDF when required.</p><p>Members of the AR and NSR are volunteers who undertake training in their spare time. In order to facilitate the voluntary nature of Reserve Service and to maximise attendance of Reserve personnel, training continues to be organised both in and out of normal working hours, at weekends and during academic and traditional holiday periods.</p><p>In the AR, recruits undergo varied training in areas such as combat first aid, military law and tactical training. A major part of Recruit training is training in the use of the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle. RDF personnel are additionally trained in the operation of basic radio communications, map reading, Nuclear, Biological &amp;amp; Chemical warfare defence and the Light Machine Gun. Each Corps also carries out specialist training in its particular field. </p><p>In the NSR, the two main courses undertaken as a recruit are Sea Survival and Damage Control &amp;amp; Fire Fighting. NSR personnel also undergo training in the operation of various crafts operated by the Naval Service, such as Motor Training Launches and Rigid Inflatable Boat as well as training in VHF Radios and the operation of VHF systems at sea.  Courses are additionally run for personnel on the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System. </p><p>For the current year, Subhead A.5 provides for a budget of &euro;2.15 million of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated for Paid Training Mandays for members of the Reserve. This allocation will provide seven days annual paid training for each effective member of the AR and NSR. The budget also provides for fourteen days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the AR and NSR in 2020, along with career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities. </p><p>The utilisation of the training budget allocated to the RDF from 2015 to date is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>RDF Training Budget Allocation</th>       <th>Spend</th>       <th>Number of AR and NSR members who availed of paid training days</th>       <th>Total number of paid training days used</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>&euro;2.068m</td>       <td>&euro;1.736m</td>       <td>1,475</td>       <td>22,548</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;2.068m</td>       <td>&euro;1.568m</td>       <td>1,298</td>       <td>19,710</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;2.068m</td>       <td>&euro;1.38m</td>       <td>1,133</td>       <td>17,488</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;2.068m</td>       <td>&euro;1.538m</td>       <td>1,091</td>       <td>19,351</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;2.068m</td>       <td>&euro;1.554m</td>       <td>956</td>       <td>15,191</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020*</td>       <td>&euro;2.068m</td>       <td>&euro;0.809m</td>       <td>637</td>       <td>9,905</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*as of 30 Sept 2020</p><p>I am satisfied that members of the AR and NSR are afforded the opportunity to avail of training and update their skills on an ongoing basis and that the extensive and professional training provided to the Reserve is a major motivating factor in encouraging people to join it as well as encouraging retention of existing members.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020 provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of 80 General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles is well underway.   This programme is on-going and continues to command significant resources and commitment of effort.  The vehicle, which is the backbone of Defence Forces armoured capability, has been well proven in all its roles since the first vehicles were introduced in 2001.  By end-2020, it is anticipated some 52 vehicles will have been upgraded including modernisation of protection systems and weapons. The overall programme is due to be completed by 2022. In addition, an order for 28 Armoured Utility Vehicles AUVs was recently placed with Centigon, a French company, and these will provide a level of  protected mobility between the levels of soft-skinned light transport and heavier armoured vehicles.</p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2019 a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3/4 tonne 4 X4 vehicles, the first of which entered service in early 2020. In March of this year a tender process was completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4 X 4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with the award of a contract to Westward Scania, based in Strokestown, Co. Roscommon. The first vehicles are scheduled for delivery in 2020 with delivery of all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023. Funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  A step change in military air-based capability is being achieved through the acquisition of Pilatus PC-12 aircraft.  While nominally a replacement for the Cessna, the new aircraft move capabilities considerably ahead of the present level.  The original order of three aircraft which were delivered in September 2020 was augmented on an urgent basis by an additional aircraft delivered in April 2020 to enhance fixed wing capacity to meet demands arising from Covid-19.  The PC-12 has proven itself an effective and versatile asset.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence also sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service  including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class vessels, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh, as well as, in due course, the replacement of L&Eacute; Eithne.  The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well underway.  The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the next scheduled component of the White Paper fleet investment programme.  Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding and the Equipment Development Plan (EDP) process.  The EDP outlines that the MRV project is in the planning ongoing stage with an indicative timeframe for progression from the current year through to 2024.</p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment. In July of this year a tender competition was commenced  for the supply of Software Defined Radios to the Defence Forces and the competition is currently underway. The scope of the project consists of two main requirements; Personal Soldier Radios and Multi-Band Handheld, Manpack, Vehicular and Airborne radios. Given the complexity of the requirements the procurement process is expected to be comprehensive in nature with the first radios not expected to enter service before 2023. </p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022.   Budget 2021 provides for a further increased gross allocation to &pound;131m in the defence capital budget in respect of equipment and barracks infrastructure.  This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

These written examinations will be based on the normal question paper format, content and structure, and duration as in previous years. </p>  <p>  These postponed examinations are being provided to students who are unhappy with the outcome of the calculated grades process, as well as to the small number of students who may not be awarded a calculated grade in the absence of credible teacher data to generate an estimated mark.</p>  <p>  Candidates taking the November examinations will be graded on the basis of their written papers. It would not be feasible or practical at this stage to conduct examinations in oral or practical components, or to try to complete unfinished coursework.  </p>  <p>  The earlier arrangement communicated in March, that full marks would be awarded in respect of oral language and music performance tests for Leaving Certificate, no longer applies.  The March announcement was intended to support the running of all other examination components in the normal fashion as part of a response to the emergency situation relating to Covid-19 at the time.  Candidates were not automatically awarded full marks in respect of any examination component in the Calculated Grades system. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate or fair to now award full marks for some examination components in the interest of inter-candidate equity between those sitting a later examination and those receiving a calculated grade.</p>  <p>  Following the closure of schools in March 2020, my Department published a range of guidance to assist schools and teachers in ensuring continuity of teaching and learning for students, as well as supporting their wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  This guidance aimed to ensure regular engagement of students in lessons, tasks and learning experiences across the range of curriculum subjects, provision of regular assignments and regular, practical, supportive and customised feedback on work submitted.  Schools engaged with their students in various ways, in accordance with the technology and broadband resources available in school and at home.</p>  <p>  The aim of the remote learning approaches adopted by schools, the guidance that was issued to all schools, and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of the school closures and to enable students to complete the curriculum before tuition for 6th year students ceased on 11 May.</p>  <p>  Candidates who elect to sit postponed examinations are no longer students in schools. The school which they attended have a new cohort of 6th year students who will be preparing for examinations in 2021, as well as full cohorts of students in every other year. On a practical level, schools will have had no capacity (infrastructural or staffing) to offer additional tuition to candidates for the autumn examinations.</p>  <p>  In addition, offering additional supports to students opting to sit the postponed examinations would not be equitable to those who did decide not to so opt. As students may combine their examination results with Calculated Grades results, offering supports to those taking the examinations could result in them having an advantage in attaining grades that would not be offered to students who decide not to opt to sit the postponed examinations. It should also be borne in mind that students choosing to sit postponed examinations will have had additional time to prepare for examination and, if they choose, may opt to sit less than the full suite of examinations. </p></reply>

There are no current plans to revise school planning areas.</p>  <p>  The new post primary school to which the Deputy refers was announced in 2018 following nationwide demographic analysis which identified an emerging demand at post primary level in the Booterstown_Blackrock and Dunlaoghaire SPAs.  For that reason, the school is being established in 2021 as a regional solution to serve those school planning areas.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, Honey Park is located in the Sallynoggin_Killiney_DLR school planning area, which is adjacent to the Dunlaoghaire SPA. As the Deputy may be aware, a new 8 classroom primary school is to be established in 2021 to serve the Sallynoggin_Killiney_DLR/North school planning area and a patronage process for that school has just commenced, with school patron bodies/prospective school patron bodies invited to apply for the patronage of the new primary school.  It is anticipated that the Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) for this school will open for parental preferences soon after the patron application process is completed.</p>  <p>  The OPPS for the new post-primary school for the Booterstown_Blackrock and D&uacute;n Laoghaire school planning areas, along with three other post-primary schools to be established in 2021, is currently ongoing. </p>  <p>  All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise the enrolment of children from within the designated school planning areas which the school is being established to serve. Accordingly, only parents of eligible children residing in the school planning area can express a preference with regard to the patronage of the new school. However, it is important to note that this does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.  An expression of a parental preference for patronage of a school is not an application for enrolment. Once the school has been established, parents must apply directly to the school in relation to their child&rsquo;s enrolment in the normal way.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-17a.1151.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111700084#WRW01600"><p>The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.  A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms.  </p>  <p>  The Yellow Flag programme aims to support primary and secondary schools to become more inclusive of all cultures and ethnicities, celebrate diversity and challenge racism and discrimination.   While respecting schools' autonomy to participate in such programmes, my Department has introduced a number of measures to assist schools in this matter.</p>  <p>  My Department's &lsquo;Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2019)' acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures.  The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach at both primary and post-primary level to supporting well-being, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, published in January 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. It recommended 12 actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying including identity based bullying are addressed.  National Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary schools, were published in September 2013 and are being implemented in all 4,000 primary and post primary schools throughout the country. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour including identity based bullying amongst their pupils.  The procedures make clear that the definition of bullying behaviour includes identity-based bullying such as racist bullying. The procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy. </p>  <p>  As part of the National Traveller and ROMA Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 (NTRIS) published by the Department of Justice and Equality, which aims to improve the lives of Travellers and ROMA in Ireland, my Department has commissioned research on the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying strategy on experiences of Traveller and Roma Children. The project was developed in consultation with the Traveller representative groups. The research project has commenced and involves engagement with children and their parents and with schools.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.</p>  <p>  In addition, curriculum at both primary and post-primary aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.   The Social Personal and Health Education Curriculum (SPHE) supports students learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.</p>  <p>  Under the Framework for Junior Cycle, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.  One of these statements is: (The student) appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she/he lives.  This junior cycle short course in CSPE focuses on supporting students in become active citizens through their learning in three strands: Rights and responsibilities, Global citizenship, and Exploring democracy. </p>  <p>  As part of the Departments ongoing curricular reform consideration of issues in relation to inclusivity/diversity etc. will be considered as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the primary curriculum and senior cycle at post-primary. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to provide guidance and information on supports such as the Yellow Flag Programme.</p></reply>

Most DEIS Urban Band 1 schools operate vertical  schools with a ratio of 22:1.</p>  <p>  As an initial step in addressing this, I have focused on a reduction in the Senior DEIS Urban Band 1 primary schools and therefore there will be a one point reduction in their staffing schedule from 24:1 to 23:1.  </p>  <p>  The total Budget allocation of additional funding of &euro;2million in 2021, with a full year allocation of &euro;5million in 2022 provides  for further supports to be allocated as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage.  My Department continues to support those schools most in need and is considering options on how best to achieve this.</p></reply>

This recognises that some aspects of casework will require the psychologist to work in the school, while other aspects of the work may be done remotely in order to minimise risk and maximise safety.  </p><p>As part of a package of measures to support the reopening of our schools the provision of an additional seventeen psychologist posts to NEPS was announced bringing overall sanctioned numbers to 221 whole time equivalent psychologist posts.  </p><p>In relation to speech and language therapists and art therapists, as they are not Departmental staff, I am not in a position to direct them to visit schools.  I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe and sustainable reopening of all Schools which provides guidance on the safe reopening of schools. This guidance includes information on Access to Schools. Arrangements for necessary visitors is restricted to essential purposes and limited to those who have obtained prior approval from the principal.<b></b>Therefore the guidelines do not prohibit the visiting to schools by external personnel or professionals for the purpose of supporting schools, or for essential purposes.</p></reply>

Where possible the opening of doors and windows should be encouraged to increase natural ventilation. The guidance also sets out that air flow and ventilation should be increased where climate allows. </p><p>The overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times, lunch-times and at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use.  Windows do not need to be open as wide in colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom.

These engagements included 2539 Inspectorate-led advisory sessions with school principals and 114 school visits to support the safe provision of schooling (SSPS). A breakdown of these engagements by week and by county is available in the attached document. Other inspection work being carried out by the Inspectorate through visits to schools includes Child Protection and Safeguarding Inspections (CPSI), urgent Follow-through inspections and the conclusion of inspections that had been put on hold since schools closed in March. </p><p>The advisory sessions with school principals, most of which have been conducted using video-conferencing facilities, have been a key focus of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work with schools since the start of the school year.  Inspectors have advised and supported schools in a range of areas including the operation of schools, student well-being and teaching and learning. These sessions have also provided valuable information on the successes and challenges experienced by school communities in relation to the safe re-opening of schools. It is intended that all remaining schools will have the opportunity to avail of an advisory session in the coming months. </p><p>The school visits supporting the safe provision of schooling (SSPS), which have been carried out on a trial basis, aim to support school leaders as they implement the COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe and sustainable reopening of schools. They also aim to provide an assurance that the COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe and sustainable reopening of schools is being implemented by school authorities. To date, the visits have been trialed in two phases in September and October. The outcomes of these visits have been reported to the Health and Safety Authority and have informed the development of the focus and format of this inspection activity.  Findings from the trial visits that have been undertaken are generally positive, with most schools and centres found to be compliant with the checks undertaken. A third phase of trial visits to a larger number of schools is currently underway. In addition, as required by Section 13(8) of the Education Act, 1998, formal consultations are being undertaken with the education partners on the SSPS visits and it is envisaged that following receipt and consideration of written observations from the education partners, that the Minister will approve the Guide to SSPS inspection visits.

However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p><p>In accordance with the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have drafted new policies to be published on the school&rsquo;s website. </p><p>The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria for application in the event of oversubscription, in their admission policies. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. </p><p>Further information on the new admission process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at<i>www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/School-Enrolment</i>.</p><p>In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit Data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.</p><p>The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives:</p><p>1. Enhanced engagement with local authorities in relation to the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process</p><p>2. Additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements, Education and Training Boards, Diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can also be an important source of local knowledge. This will add to information also provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools.</p><p>3.

The Department continues to keep this practical guidance for schools under review in line with public health advice.</p><p>With respect to available funding, in addition to the payment of the standard &euro;30m minor works grant at primary level for 2020 and the &euro;75 million minor work grant funding provided to schools under the July Stimulus Programme, my Department recently announced a further &euro;55 million in minor works grants for primary and post-primary schools to be paid in early December, 2020. The &euro;55 million payments will involve:</p><p>-  an additional &euro;25m funding for Covid-19 related Minor Works at post-primary level;  </p><p>-  bringing forward from 2021 the standard &euro;30m minor works grant at primary level.</p><p>The minor works grant funding provides good flexibility at local level to assist schools to manage in the Covid environment. For example, schools may use this funding to enhance ventilation in classrooms, such as enabling permanent ventilation openings through vent in a wall or in window frame(s) where not currently available in a classroom.  The payment of the grants at this stage gives schools a good lead-in period to plan and undertake works that support the operation of the school in the current school year and assist in catering for capacity and other requirements going into the 2021/22 school year.</p></reply>

As part of the planning process, the Department consults with local authorities concerning residential developments being progressed or in the pipeline.  This is to ensure that schools infrastructure planning aligns with the demographic changes arising from new residential development.  Since 2018 a total of 47 new schools have been announced to open in the period 2019-2022.  </p>  <p>  In the case of each new school, the Department analyses the best option for the provision of the school, in terms of whether an existing property already in State ownership could be used or whether the new school necessitates the acquisition of a new greenfield site.  If a new site is identified as the best option, suitably zoned sites in the area are considered and the designation of a site for school use is typically very helpful.  However, in instances where the site has been zoned to meet the potential need of a future community it may be the case that the required infrastructure and services are not yet in place and the development of that site to meet a current school need may be premature.   Nevertheless, all identified site options are fully considered with a view to ensuring the provision of suitable accommodation for the school in question.   </p>  <p>   When  the school is required to open before the  site is acquired, my Department co-ordinates arrangements for suitable interim accommodation to enable the school to open while the site acquisition and the planning process concludes.</p></reply>

Enrolment information for the 2020 school year is not yet available.</p><p>Regarding school enrolment, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998.  In schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. </p><p>The selection process used by schools and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p><p>In accordance with the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have drafted new policies to be published on the school&rsquo;s website. </p><p>The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria for application in the event of oversubscription, in their admission policies. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves.</p><p>Further information on the new admission process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/School-Enrolment</i>.</p><p>In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit Data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.</p><p>The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives:</p><p>1. Enhanced engagement with local authorities in relation to the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process;</p><p>2. Additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements, Education and Training Boards, Diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can also be an important source of local knowledge.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, since April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 45 new schools over the 4 year period 2019 to 2022. This included a new school for the Kilcoole and Greystones area as a regional solution and the school, Greystones Community College, opened in Greystones for the 2020/2021 school year.</p>  <p>  The following post-primary schools currently serve the Greystones School Planning Area:</p>  <p>  - TempleCarrig Secondary School Greystones &ndash; this is a co-educational school with capacity for 750 pupils and was established in 2014.</p>  <p>  - St. David&rsquo;s Secondary School Greystones is a co-educational school and a major building project to expand the school to cater for 750 pupils commenced on site in October 2020. This project is expected to be completed in 22 months i.e. by July 2023.</p>  <p>  - Greystones Community College &ndash; this new school was established in September 2020. The proposal is to provide permanent accommodation for 1,000 pupils when the school is fully developed. Discussions are ongoing with the landowner of a designated site at Charlesland, Greystones with a view to acquiring the site to construct the new school.</p>  <p>  Greystones Community College opened its doors to 64 first year pupils in September 2020 in interim accommodation in Greystones Lawn Tennis Club. My Department is looking at all potential options in the area in the short and medium term ahead of the school&rsquo;s move to its designated permanent site in Charlesland, Greystones. This will include the provision of appropriate temporary accommodation, including specialist rooms, as quickly as possible as the current school year progresses. My officials will continue to work closely with Kildare Wicklow ETB and the school to ensure that the needs of the school community are met.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is the existing school in the adjacent Kilcoole School Planning Area, Col&aacute;iste Craobh Abhann, which currently has accommodation for 750 pupils and for which there is a major project approved to expand the school to 1,000 pupils. This project is in early architectural planning and is being delivered by the National Development Finance Agency. Additional temporary accommodation was approved in 2019 to cater for expanding enrolments pending completion of this extension. It is open to the school's patron to submit an application for additional interim accommodation to my Department should this be required.</p>  <p>  My Department is satisfied that with the establishment of Greystones Community College as a new regional school for the Greystones/Kilcoole area and with the completion of the building projects at St. David&rsquo;s Secondary School, Greystones and Col&aacute;iste Craobh Abhann, Kilcoole that the resulting additional permanent accommodation will be sufficient to cater for future demand in the area.</p>  <p>  Similar to the process adopted for September 2020 readiness, my Department will be engaging further with patron bodies shortly in advance of identifying specific September 2021 capacity pressure points priorities which will necessitate specific action.</p>  <p>  In a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; year, addressing the increase demands for school places, whilst challenging, is manageable &ndash; generally through utilisation of existing spare capacity within schools, rental of temporary accommodation or other short term measures pending the delivery of permanent accommodation.  My Department is engaging with the authorities of the post primary schools in the area to determine the level of demand in the Greystones area for 2021 with a view to determining the action necessary to ensure that all students in the Greystones area have a place at second level in 2021.</p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year on all school transport scheme services - both Bus &Eacute;ireann services and private contractor operator services. </p>  <p>  Based on the public health advice published in early July, and the updated advice received from the HPSC on 7th August and from NPHET on the 18th August, the Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, using 50 per cent of passenger capacity. The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of weeks and over the coming weeks, Bus &Eacute;ireann will be implementing 50% capacity on a rolling basis as soon as it is possible to do so on all remaining routes.  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation is achieved as quickly as possible on all post-primary services, including Special Educational Needs post-primary transport services.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education have put in place measures to support infection prevention and control on primary and post-primary services.  The Department has also issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. Measures include all post-primary students wearing masks, all bus drivers and bus escorts receiving PPE where necessary, as well as funding to support additional cleaning and hygiene measures, including the provision of sanitiser on all buses.  Seating plans with pre-assigned seating are also in place on all routes, with children sitting next to their siblings or classmates where possible which reduces interaction on school transport services.</p></reply>

The proposal does not involve the establishment of a new school but rather an additional campus of an existing school, albeit located some distance apart. The engagement included assessing options in Dundalk for the 2020/21 school year and beyond, given the role of school patrons in the provision of additional school accommodation.  </p>  <p>  Locating the proposed campus in part of the Col&aacute;iste Ch&uacute; Chulainn premises/school, which Louth and Meath Education and Training Board had being willing to facilitate, has not proven to be acceptable to some parties previously involved with the Aonad at Col&aacute;iste Ch&uacute; Chulainn and my Department has agreed to consider an alternative mechanism. </p>  <p>  The school patron making the proposal had identified a potential property from which it proposed the campus would operate.  My Department arranged a technical inspection of the property and subsequently had further engagement with the school patron.  It has recently come to light that the property proposed by the school patron may not be available to lease for the purpose of accommodating the proposed campus.  My Department has requested the school patron to establish the exact position on this.  Should it not be available, other options which may be identified can be considered.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the ETB property referenced by the Deputy, my Department understands that this property is fully utilised for further education purposes and accordingly is not available for the purpose requested. </p>  <p>  In order for the proposal from the Irish-medium patron and associated costs to be fully assessed, it is necessary to have certainty on the location of the proposed campus and costs arising.  While this is worked through, those students who have chosen to enrol in the Gaelchol&aacute;iste under the patronage of the Irish-medium school patron located some distance away, continue to be served by school transport. My Department also understands that Col&aacute;iste Ch&uacute; Chulainn continues to accept applications for enrolment in its Aonad.</p></reply>

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. </p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have not yet been commenced, however, the Government has continued to invest in the area of special education support.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice. Full consultation will also take place with stakeholders before adjustments are made.  </p><p>This Government will also continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:</p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. </p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

All CPD provision is constantly reviewed and refined to meet the needs of schools, teachers and to improve the learning opportunities for students.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) also provides a programme of Teacher Professional Learning. These programmes are directed specifically to teachers of students with special educational needs. In 2019, 16,511 teachers were engaged in professional development and learning at NCSE seminars and whole staff seminars.</p>  <p>  The NCSE also offer a range of in-school supports for schools and they facilitate those teachers working with students with autism to access courses provided through the Middletown Centre for Autism. </p>  <p>  The professional development needs of teachers in recent years have been addressed through the provision of an induction programme for newly qualified teachers, dedicated support for school leaders, national CPD for curricular and policy reform, and ongoing support for teachers.</p>  <p>  All CPD programmes provided by Department-funded support services to teachers include provision for teaching and learning in the inclusive classroom through differentiated teaching methodologies.  Graduates of the reconfigured initial teacher-education programmes must now demonstrate the achievement of learning outcomes in the areas of:</p>  <p>  -  applying knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching;</p>  <p>  -  assessment of learner needs and evaluation of progress;</p>  <p>  -  classroom management strategies for differentiated learning;</p>  <p>  -  knowledge and understanding of themes such as inclusion and diversity and how these are related to life experiences.</p>  <p>  Through Cos&aacute;n, the Teaching Council&rsquo;s national Framework for Teachers&rsquo; Learning, the Teaching Council is seeking to foster a culture of professional learning based on teachers&rsquo; active engagement in their own learning, for their benefit and that of their students. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Teaching Council to support the development and embedding of Cos&aacute;n within the continuum of teacher education and taking account of existing supports, resources and structures that are already in place. </p>  <p>  As I understand it, the evidence gathered by the Teaching Council has led it to the conclusion that ongoing learning by teachers should be both encouraged and incentivised so as to ensure authentic engagement, in a way that is sustainable and impactful. Through the Cos&aacute;n Development Process, the Council is exploring with the profession how this can be best achieved. </p></reply>

Similar databases are in place already at other levels of education. In time, the Department is very confident that the database will not only reduce administrative burden and form filling for both schools and parents, but will play a vital role in underpinning the provision of education for all primary school pupils.&rdquo;</p><p>It should be noted, however, that it is not necessary for a child to have a PPSN to be enrolled in a school and to have their details entered on POD. In a case where a pupil is waiting for a PPSN to be issued to them their details can still be entered on the POD system to create a pupil profile. In this instance the mother&rsquo;s maiden acts as a placeholder until the PPSN is received and the pupil's POD profile can be updated at that stage. Such a pupil will still be counted towards capitation and allocation purposes provided they are enrolled in the school on the Census date, 30<sup>th</sup>September for academic year 2020-21, and are expected to continue to remain in attendance for the remainder of the school year.</p><p>Provision is also made, as per POD Circular 25/2015, for parents of children who do not want their details recorded on POD, extract below:</p><p>1. Parents/guardians who continue to object to the onward provision of data to POD need to put their objections in writing to the school in order for their wishes to be carried out. Note that verbal objections will <b>not </b>be sufficient in this regard, as schools will be required by the Department to maintain written records of objections, and parents who do not put their objections in writing should be informed by the school that their record will be otherwise transferred to POD within a four week timeframe. Parents/guardians who object should be given every opportunity to provide their objections in writing to the school.</p><p>2. Schools that are in receipt of a letter from a parent outlining their objections to the onward provision of data to POD can create a partial record for that pupil on POD, using the guidelines available on request from the POD Helpdesk. This will ensure that a record is created for the pupil which will be counted for grant payments and teacher allocation purposes.</p></reply>

The key objective of the Plan was to set out and implement actions, over a short 18 month period, that were achievable and which have the greatest impact on Online Safety for everyone. </p><p>The Action Plan was implemented under the guidance of a Sponsors Group established for that purpose. </p><p>The Sponsors Group comprised representatives of the then six key Government Departments with responsibility for online safety namely: </p><p>- Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) leads on structured engagements by Departments with online platforms; and review of the Audio Media Visual Services Directive; and also provides the secretariat to the National Advisory Council for Online Safety</p><p>-  Department of Education and Skills (DES) leads on schools policy development; Webwise; support for schools, teachers, students and parents.</p><p>-  Department of Justice and Equality (DJE) leads on oversight of hotline.ie; legislative changes to criminal law; liaison with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on implementation/enforcement issues; and disbursement of EU funding</p><p>-  Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) leads on consultative engagement with children and young people, including through Comhairles, and Children First guidance</p><p>-  Department of Health (D/Health) leads on the development of online mental health tools that augment existing services and implementation of Healthy Ireland</p><p>-  Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) leads on oversight of the E-commerce Directive (2000/31/EC) and coordination of the EU Digital Single Market strategy</p><p>The Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills chaired the Sponsored Group for the duration of the 18 month plan.  The Action Plan was based around five goals and set out twenty five specific actions (with 48 constituent actions), to be progressed over the period of the Plan which commenced in July 2018 and ended December 2019.  By the end of 2019, 44 of the 48 actions had been fully achieved.Significant progress was made in the implementation of the remaining four remaining actions which relates to ongoing development in regulation and legislation and include:</p><p>1. revising the legislative framework and regulatory oversight structure through the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill (action 17.2 DCCAE)</p><p>2. working with industry to produce a practical guide for online platforms to encourage a standardised approach to best practice in online safety at all stages of design, development and roll out (action 15.1 DCCAE) </p><p>3. increasing Internet Service Providers sign up to codes of practice and ethics (action 13.2 DJE)  </p><p>4. working with industry to publish regular transparency reports in relation to illegal and harmful online content including under the proposed Regulation on Preventing the Dissemination of Terrorist Content  (14.2 DCCAE/DJE)</p><p>The Action Plan provided that functional responsibility for the delivery of the Actions remains with the lead Department with responsibility for the relevant policy areas. The actions that fell within the remit of my Department were implemented.</p><p>The progression of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill was transferred by Government Order from the former Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the New Department of Media, Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht and Sports for progression and progress continues to be made in the progression of this Bill.</p><p>The elements of online safety policy (including actions set out above) and that rested within DCCAE have all transferred to the new Department.  </p><p>The Department of Justice also has links with the delivery of actions 14.2 above and also for the delivery of action 13.2. </p><p>The Action Plan, and progress reports on its implementation covering the period July 2018-June 2019, are available at www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/be-safe-online/gov.ie.</p><p>The final progress report covering the six period July &ndash; December 2019 is also complete and is expected to be published in the coming weeks on gov.ie. </p><p>An Online Safety Hub, a repository providing links to the online safety resources and information available across the six key Government Departments is available at www.gov.ie/besafeonline.</p><p>My Department continues to support schools, parents and young people on online safety measures while they also enjoy the benefits of using digital technologies in teaching and learning practices as provided for in the Digital Strategy for Schools.</p></reply>

However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p><p>In accordance with the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have drafted new policies to be published on the school&rsquo;s website. </p><p>The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria for application in the event of oversubscription, in their admission policies. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. </p><p>Further information on the new admission process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/School-Enrolment</i>.</p><p>In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit Data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.</p><p>The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives:</p><p>1. Enhanced engagement with local authorities in relation to the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process;</p><p>2. Additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements, Education and Training Boards, Diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can also be an important source of local knowledge. This will add to information also provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools.  </p><p>3. Utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of POD, P-POD returns process.</p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>-  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>-  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>-  Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>The delivery of a building project for Selskaer College, Wexford Town to construct a new 1,000 pupil school has been agreed and its delivery is being devolved to Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB). </p><p>Similar to the process adopted for September 2020 readiness, the Department will be engaging further with patron bodies shortly in advance of identifying specific September 2021 capacity pressure points priorities which will necessitate specific action.  </p><p>In a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; year, addressing the increase demands for school places, whilst challenging, is manageable &ndash; generally through utilisation of existing spare capacity within schools, rental, temporary accommodation or other short term measures pending the delivery of permanent accommodation.</p></reply>

A third of 17 year olds were found to rely totally on school-based RSE to get their information on sex and relationships, with no parental input.</p>  <p>  Further findings include a significant variation in the provision of RSE at a school level. This was not found to be along the lines of school size, gender mix or ethos, which suggests that school policy and leadership play an important role in determining the level of RSE provision in schools. This is in agreement with previous research in this area. However, there was no significant link found between the level of RSE provision in schools and young people&rsquo;s sexual behaviour and competence.</p>  <p>  The report referenced that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA)&rsquo;s review into RSE a number of times. The NCCA review, along with the focus on wellbeing in the Framework for Junior Cycle was stated to provide an opportunity to consider the issue of how information and support on sex are provided in schools. However, the report cautioned that without significant parental involvement, even the most comprehensive and high quality RSE provision in schools is limited in the effectiveness it can have. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Currriculum and Assessment (NCCA) conducted a thorough and transparent review, and published its report, &ldquo;Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary Schools&rdquo; in December 2019. This Report was developed on foot of extensive consultation which was conducted between June 2018 and March 2019.</p>  <p>  The NCCA report makes a number of recommendations. This includes primarily the development of a single integrated curriculum for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) in schools. Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE/RSE will commence in the NCCA in 2021, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle. This work will include engagement with all the key education stakeholders as well as a further process of public consultation before any new curriculum specifications are finalised.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. These groups were unable to commence their work until recently due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings. However, meetings of these groups have been convened and will continue to be convened from December on an ongoing basis. This will allow them to review significant work that has been progressed.</p>  <p>  The NCCA is currently developing interim guidance for SPHE and RSE across primary and post-primary levels. These support materials will be made available in the form of an online toolkit. They will provide guidance on how the current curriculum can be approached in a more holistic way. The materials have been to the development groups from October. It is anticipated that some guidance materials will be published before the end of 2020 and that they will be supplemented incrementally during 2021.</p>  <p>  The NCCA has worked collaboratively with the teacher professional development support services and other relevant groups in completing an audit of current teaching and learning resources relevant to SPHE/RSE and compiled a comprehensive resource list which will be published as part of the online toolkit for SPHE/RSE. This will provide a single, online access point for up-to-date resources.</p>  <p>  Further recommendations in the report in relation to Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) regarding SPHE and RSE are being considered by my Department with a view to putting enhanced supports in place.</p></reply>

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.   In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams which commenced on 16 November.</p></reply>

CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award.</p>  <p>  In either scenario, a maximum of three consecutive year's participation on CE is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a twelve month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).</p>  <p>  Prior to 2017, there were two available options for participating on CE.  Both options commenced with one year of participation with the possibility of either one or two more years, depending on the option taken.  Both options were subject to qualification criteria and neither required the CE participant to undertake any training resulting in the achievement of a major award.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the new conditions and qualifying criteria were introduced and a saver clause was provided for the existing clients:</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Participants who commenced on CE prior to 3rd July 2017 will be entitled to remain under their existing CE eligibility rules, where this is to their advantage.  If it is more advantageous to the person, the current criteria can be applied.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The saver clause that was introduced allowed CE participants who commenced under that option to continue on CE for a maximum of three consecutive years with or without working towards a QQI major award, whichever was more advantageous. The 2017 saver clause does not allow those affected to continue to participate on CE for six years consecutively.  </p>  <p>  The same continuous limitation of three years continues to apply to all CE participants both pre and post 2017.  CE participation was never intended to be long-term and the maximum continued participation on CE is three years. </p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  Places on these work programmes will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, while maintaining the role of CE as an active labour market programme.   </p>  <p>  While I understand that CE participants may wish to remain on a CE scheme for longer than the permissible time, the Deputy will appreciate that such extensions would have a detrimental effect on other long-term unemployed candidates wishing to avail of the opportunities afforded by CE.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve CE for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities.</p></reply>

It is also available to self-employed persons who can demonstrate that their income ceased, or reduced, as a direct consequence of Covid-19, to the extent that they would be available to take up full-time employment.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment was placed on a statutory footing as a social welfare benefit in its own right from 5 August 2020 under the Social Welfare (Covid-19)(Amendment) Act 2020.</p>  <p>  There is a requirement under social welfare legislation that persons must claim their entitlements within a specific period from the date their entitlement arises. The requirements in respect of the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment are the same as those which apply to Jobseekers payments generally. A person must submit their claim on their first day of unemployment. However, reasonable regard is had to issues such as postal delays. In addition, incomplete claims which are received or which cannot be initially processed are always taken from the date of initial receipt.  A claim may be backdated for up to six months where a person can prove to the satisfaction of a Deciding Officer or Appeals Officer that they satisfied the qualifying conditions throughout the period and that there was good cause for the delay in making their claim.   </p>  <p>   My Department is keenly aware that many people who applied for the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment may be due arrears, either because their first payment was not backdated to their initial date of application or because of some other issue such as, for example, an issue relating to bank account details. All claims are being identified to identify instances where this arose and to arrange for payments to be made to the individuals in question. </p>  <p>   In order to address an issue of this scale, my Department has been developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that this work is a priority for my Department and it is hoped to make payments in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Payment was backdated to 20 February 2020, as the rate is higher than the qualified adult payments but is less than payments made on the State pension (non-contributory) when the living alone increase and fuel allowance payable at the time were included.  They were notified in writing of this decision on 12 November 2020 and provided with a copy of their social insurance record on which the decision was based.  An application for fuel allowance has been forwarded to them.  It is open to the person concerned to re-apply for State pension (non-contributory) if they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  The person concerned previously incurred an overpayment of jobseeker's allowance.  My Department is obliged to recover all debt owed to it as quickly as possible and within the relevant legislation and guidelines governing the recovery of debt. Pension arrears due, being the difference between qualified adult payments made from 20 February and the rate of State pension (contributory) subsequently awarded, have been withheld to offset against the person&rsquo;s debt, in accordance with social welfare legislation. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year are liable to pay social insurance contributions at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  Such contributors are currently covered for a wide range of social insurance benefits including State Pension (Contributory), Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension (Contributory), Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (Contributory), Maternity, Adoptive and Paternity benefits, treatment benefits, Invalidity Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, stipulates that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory), unless the person has paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one year prior to reaching age 66 and all outstanding self-employment contributions have been paid by him/her in full.  </p>  <p>  Where contributions are paid subsequent to a claimant&rsquo;s 66th birthday, State Pension (Contributory) can only be awarded from the date on which the self-employment liability has been fully discharged.  These provisions are consistent with the contributory and solidarity principles underpinning the social insurance system. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  </p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides a support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  The Department may make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.</p></reply>

These positions are filled on a temporary, fixed term basis.</p>  <p>  A number of new conditions were introduced to the CE Scheme in July 2017 to further support progression to employment, broaden CE access to a wider range of people and to standardise the conditions relating to the length of time a CE participant can remain on a CE scheme.</p>  <p>  In general CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  CE participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification. CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award.</p>  <p>  In either scenario, a maximum of three consecutive year&rsquo;s participation is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a 12 month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).</p>  <p>  Prior to 2017, there were two available options for participating on CE.  Both options commenced with one year of participation with the possibility of either one or two more years, depending on the option taken.  Both options were subject to qualification criteria and neither required the CE participant to undertake any training resulting in the achievement of a major award. </p>  <p>  When the new conditions and qualifying criteria were introduced in 2017 a saver clause was provided for the existing clients:</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Participants who commenced on CE prior to 3rd July 2017 will be entitled to remain under their existing CE eligibility rules, where this is to their advantage. If it is more advantageous to the person, the current criteria can be applied.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The saver clause allowed participants who commenced under one of the options to continue on CE for a maximum of 3 consecutive years with or without working towards a QQI major award, whichever was more advantageous.</p>  <p>  The 2017 saver clause does not allow those affected to continue to participate on CE for six years consecutively.  The same continuous limitation of three years continues to apply to all CE participants both pre and post 2017.  Participation on CE was never intended to be long-term and the maximum continued participation on CE is three years.</p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria of all CE participants are reviewed annually as CE projects are funded under annual contracts.  Three participants on the Kildysart Coolmeen Cranny CLG Scheme have exceeded three continuous years participation on the scheme and the new scheme is due to commence on 25th January 2021.   </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will review the participation limits for these three participants and will actively work with Kildysart Coolmeen Cranny CLG to secure eligible candidates for the CE scheme. Referrals will be made where CE is considered by the Department&rsquo;s Case Officers to be a suitable activation measure for the jobseeker.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

Consequently, there are over 1.4 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. </p>  <p>  During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, my Department has been developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that this work is a priority for my Department and it is hoped to make payments in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In this regard, it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Pensions Commission and I will introduce legislation shortly to give effect to this.  </p>  <p>  The Commission's Terms of Reference includes the examination of sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  More broadly, it will also consider the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and consider how the pension system can further accommodate carers, who are predominantly women.  </p>  <p>  The membership of the Commission, approved by Government, reflects the need to have subject matter experts to deal with the complex social and public policy issues arising in pensions, as well as stakeholder representation which will keep the work of the Commission grounded.  This includes representation of workers, employers, civil society, academics and those with technical and policy expertise.  In this regard, the membership also includes those with involvement in organisations supporting older people.  The Government was keen to ensure that the Commission had strong female membership in its membership. It will be chaired by Ms. Josephine Feehily.  I am satisfied that the Commission, with its gender-balanced membership and extensive experience of social and public policy, will be keenly aware of the gender dimension of pensions policy and delivery and will bring this perspective to bear in its work.  </p>  <p>  The Commission will also engage with a range of key stakeholders to ensure that it has a genuine understanding of not only the fiscal sustainability challenges involved, but also the associated social sustainability challenges of implementing potential policy reforms.  The exact mechanisms for this engagement will be shaped by the Chair and by Commission members.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while this Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State's finances, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case. </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, the Commission will report to Government by 30 June of next year and the Government will take action having regard to the recommendations of the Commission within 6 months.</p>  <p>  Further details of the Commission's membership and terms of reference are available on the Departmental website at: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/b1c64-minister-humphreys-announces-the-establishment-of-the-pensions-commission/.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

SOLAS, as the statutory agency overseeing the apprenticeship system, has been charged with responsibility for developing, delivering and administering this new scheme.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will keep my Department&rsquo;s employment support schemes for people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme under review to ensure that they continue to meet their policy objectives.  However, any potential changes to these schemes can only be considered in the wider budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This will also help to decide if extra supports are needed.  In their report to NPHET on the outcomes of the testing programme, the HSE concluded that further serial testing on a national scale was not warranted at that time.  However, serial testing at individual centres may still take place as and when local public health authorities determine it to be necessary.</p><p>My officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) strongly encouraged all residents and staff to participate to help keep themselves, their families and their communities safe from coronavirus. Any resident or staff member invited to attend follow up testing by the HSE is also encouraged to do so. </p><p>The IPAS cooperate fully with the HSE in respect of any testing that Public Health may decide to undertake.  Any resident who tests positive is moved offsite for self-isolation, along with their close contacts in the centre, until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. The HSE operate two off-site facilities and IPAS also have provided one isolation centre.</p><p>In addition to isolation facilities, two quarantine facilities have also been established.  One provides 14-day quarantine for persons applying for IPAS accommodation for the first time.</p><p>The second quarantine facility is used to accommodate people who had been residing in IPAS accommodation and left their accommodation of their own volition.  Such persons seek to return to IPAS accommodation, they are requested to quarantine for 14 days in the quarantine facility as an additional precaution before being re-accommodated.</p><p>Wraparound services continue to be provided in all isolation and quarantine centres used by IPAS residents.  Psychosocial supports are also provided through a number of NGOs including the Peter McVerry Trust and DePaul to those residents who are required to isolate or quarantine in dedicated offsite facilities due to COVID.These supports are part of the wider wraparound services which cover things like wellbeing checks, information provision, supply runs and COVID symptom checking where appropriate.</p><p>These measures around infection control and social distancing undertaken by IPAS and centre staff since last March/April have thus far successfully mitigated the potential for widespread outbreaks of the virus across the accommodation network. PPE continues to be distributed to the centres.</p><p>Recently, my officials in IPAS prepared a new IPAS living with COVID plan, which aligns IPAS Covid-19 arrangements with the Government&rsquo;s Framework Plan for Living with COVID 2020-2021.  This document has been issued to all centre managers. The plan covers issues like visitors, overnight absences, school attendance and other practical areas that will be affected as the Government scales up or down the COVID restriction levels in accordance with the national plan.</p></reply>

Tackling this issue is good for equality and it also makes good business sense, as firms that can report a low or non-existent gender pay gap will have an advantage in recruiting future employees. Initiatives to address the gender pay gap can also be expected to have a positive impact on disparities in income for women across and after their working lives.</p>  <p>  A public consultation was undertaken on the matter in autumn 2017 on the gender pay gap and this attracted a good response, with some 38 submissions received from employers, unions, civil society, professional bodies and individuals from varied backgrounds. In January 2018, a symposium brought together over 130 participants including politicians, senior policymakers, business representatives, trades unions and academics. Consultations have taken place with ICTU and Ibec about the gender pay gap especially in the context of the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill and there will be further contact both in that context and more broadly in relation to this matter.</p>  <p>  The Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019 was published on 8 April 2019 and the Bill completed D&aacute;il Committee Stage in June 2019. The Bill has been reintroduced by the Government and Report Stage is currently awaited. The aim of the Bill is to provide transparency on the gender pay gap and incentivise employers to take measures to address the issue insofar as they can. Measures such as those included in the Bill have been taken in a number of other countries and, indeed, EU member states were encouraged to take such measures in an EU Commission Recommendation of 2014.</p></reply>

It is a whole-of-government support system for those seeking international protection in Ireland.  Notwithstanding the criticisms levelled at the system, it has proven effective in ensuring that those who come to our country seeking international protection receive food and shelter and have immediate access to our state services. Over 65,000 people have been provided with shelter since its inception.</p>  <p>  The Direct Provision system ensures that all applicants can be offered immediate shelter, full board accommodation and a range of services, such as health and education while their applications are being processed. Not every person who seeks international protection chooses to accept this offer, and some choose to live independently or with friends in communities across the country, as they are entirely free to do.  Persons accommodated are free to leave the accommodation provided at any time.</p>  <p>  The improvements to living conditions for applicants for international protection have been significant over recent years. These include the implementation of self-catering arrangements in a number of accommodation centres.  In excess of 75% of residents have their own room, are a couple, are a family unit or, have own-door accommodation.  In addition, more than 65% of all residents now have access to independent living arrangements where residents can cook for themselves and their families and have more autonomy over their daily lives.</p>  <p>  All new accommodation centres coming on stream will provide for independent living. This allows for access to laundry, food-storage and cooking facilities for the use of residents. It also allows for the provision of a food-hall where residents may obtain food and other essentials free of charge on a points system based on family composition. Own-door accommodation is prioritised for families and is the preferred option for new accommodation offered to the IPAS under the regional tender competitions which were held in the past year.</p>  <p>  Information on centres opened in the past year can be found on the following website: www.accommodationcentres.ie.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a committment to ending the Direct Provision system and replacing it with a new International Protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach.  The Government has also committed to the development of a White Paper which will set out how this new system will be structured and the steps to achieving it.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Group on the Provision of Support, including Accommodation, to Persons in the International Protection Process was established last year.  It was tasked to examine best practice in other European States in the provision of services to international protection applicants, to examine likely longer term trends and to set out recommendations and solutions.  The chairperson, Dr Catherine Day, submitted the group's report to the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee T.D., and myself in late September and, following consideration of the report, Minister McEntee and I submitted the report to Government on 20 October. The Government accepted the Advisory Group&rsquo;s conclusion that the current system of Direct Provision is not fit for purpose and must be replaced.  I published the report on 21 October.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the White Paper which I expect to publish by the end of the year.  The recommendations of the  Advisory Group will inform the White Paper.  We will also consider a number of other relevant reports including the Inter-Departmental Working Group Report on Direct Provision (November 2019) and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice &amp;amp; Equality, Report on Direct Provision (December 2019).  </p>  <p>  Consultations are currently underway and include discussions with the relevant Government Departments and agencies, the Offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, relevant NGOs and housing bodies and representatives of residents of Direct Provision centres.</p>  <p>  The replacement of the Direct Provision system is complex.  It is recognised by all involved that it will take some time. However, the Advisory Group has recommended that we work to have a new system in place by mid-2023.</p>  <p>  In order to meet our legal obligations to provide accommodation and other support services for protection applicants, existing accommodation centres will continue to operate in the short to medium term. ? However, in doing so we will be focusing on the provision of own-door accommodation and facilities to allow for independent living (access to cooking and laundry facilities and communal family areas outside bedrooms) and greatly reducing any need for the use of hotels and guest-houses as an emergency measure. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to the replacement of the Direct Provision system of accommodation provision and other aspects of our international protection system that may be required so that we will have a system in Ireland that exceeds the standards required by the Reception Conditions Directive and will compare favourably with the best systems of our EU partners.</p></reply>

It also provides opportunities for workers to be granted leave to care for relatives who need support. By modernising the existing EU legal framework in the area of family-related leaves and flexible working arrangements, it is envisaged that parents and carers will be better able to reconcile their professional and private lives, and companies will benefit from more motivated workers. Member States have three years to adopt laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive (2 August 2022).  </p>  <p>  Member States are to provide for an individual right to 18 weeks of parental leave per parent, nine weeks of which must be non-transferable and paid at an adequate level, before the respective child reaches an age to be determined by the Member State (eight years minimum age). The right to request flexible uptake is enshrined in Article 5. This provision must be transposed within five years.</p>  <p>  The Government intends to extend parent's leave from two weeks to five weeks for each parent of all children born or adopted on or after 1 Nov 2019. The Government also intends to extend the period in which parent's leave can be taken up until that child turns two or, in the case of an adoption, two years after the adoption placement date of the child. This extension will apply to parents who may have already availed of their existing entitlements. Heads of a Bill to effect these changes are currently being drafted in my Department and I hope to bring these to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  The extension to parent's leave and benefit follows a number of advancements in family leaves in recent years, including the introduction of parents leave and benefit in 2019 and the extension of unpaid parental leave to 26 weeks in September this year for a child under 12 years. These advancements show Ireland's commitment to meeting the requirements of Article 5.</p></reply>

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. The most recent data available indicates that the average hourly wage in the sector was &euro;12.55 in mid-2019. This rate is higher than the "living wage" of &euro;12.30, although I acknowledge that approximately 60% of staff earn less than this wage.</p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff working in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions. However, wages in the sector remain too low. As a significant funder of the sector, alongside parents, it is imperative that my Department works with provider representatives and staff representatives to address the issue.</p>  <p>  In the medium-term, work that is currently under way to develop a new Funding Model and a Workforce Development Plan may provide new mechanisms by which the State can improve pay and working conditions in the sector. However, I am also keen to take further steps in the short-term that could support pay and working conditions. The Programme for Government commits to establish a Joint Labour Committee for the sector, with a view to developing an Employment Regulation Order.</p></reply>

I am also conscious that my Department is a significant funder of the sector, alongside parents.</p>  <p>  Since coming into office, I have held a series of meetings with stakeholders in the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector, including trade unions and member organisations representing practitioners and providers in the sector. A prominent theme in many of these meetings has been pay and working conditions, including the issue of sick pay.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has publicly stated his intention to establish a Statutory Sick Pay Scheme in full consultation with employers and unions. This would be in addition to the enhanced illness benefit which was introduced by the Government in response to Covid-19. Through the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) the T&aacute;naiste has commenced a process of engagement with the social partners on the issue of statutory sick pay. I believe it is important that the position of those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare services is considered as part of this process and my officials will engage as appropriate in any process.</p>  <p>  In the medium-term, projects ongoing in my Department such as the New Funding Model and Workforce Development Plan will both consider future policy tools that will impact on wider aspects of pay and working conditions in the sector.</p></reply>

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).</p>  <p>   A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options. </p>  <p>  My Department has, through the Estimates process, sought and received increased funding in 2021 to allow the DSS to work towards the commencement of services in mid- 2022. In the interim, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan that anticipates the commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project.  In tandem with this work, progress is also being made to finalise the amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to streamline the processes envisaged under the 2015 Act and to support the DSS to become operational.</p></reply>

This funding, which is the same amount as provided in 2020, will support the annual youth sector capital scheme to be designed and rolled out in 2021. While no decisions on areas to be prioritised as part of this fund have yet been made, ICT was a prominent feature of the scheme in 2020. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have secured an additional amount of &euro;1m capital funding in the current year to support ICT procurement in the youth sector before year end. This grant scheme is being rolled out through the ETBs in their role as funding intermediary for youth schemes and was formally announced in the last few days. This sum is additional to the Covid-related small grant scheme for the sector recently announced.</p>  <p>  This additional funding allocated to youth services in the coming year will support the delivery of universal and targeted youth services nationwide with a particular view to the role played by youth services in supporting mental wellbeing, fostering resilience and developing the social and personal competencies of young people, including disadvantaged, marginalised or vulnerable young people.</p></reply>

It has operated for several years by providing either pre-award funding or a post-award bursary. The initiative was initially rolled out from 2014 to support the introduction of the minimum National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) Level 5 qualification requirement that came into force in 2016, to allow practitioners who were already working in a setting to meet the new minimum requirement. Since then, the Learner Fund bursary has been extended to provide financial support for practitioners undertaking a range of other training and education programmes for awards at Level 5 to Level 9 on the NFQ.</p>  <p>  As part of the overall Learner Fund, since 2019 Learner Fund bursaries have been opened to childminders who achieve a level 5 or level 6 major award in early childhood care and education recognised on the National Framework of Qualifications and who register with Tusla. Childminders who are registered with Tusla can also avail of the Learner Fund graduate bursary for level 7 and 8 graduate-level awards in early learning and care.</p>  <p>  In 2020, a total of &euro;390,000 was allocated to the Learner Fund bursary programme. This includes both the graduate and childminder bursaries which operate simultaneously and are funded from the same budget.</p>  <p>  The 2019 round of the Learner Fund saw bursaries awarded to 481 applicants for completion of relevant degrees (who may include both centre-based practitioners and childminders), and 10 Tusla-registered childminders for completion of Level 5/6 awards. The 2020 round of the Learner Fund bursary has recently closed and awards will be announced shortly. </p>  <p>  The number of childminders availing of the Learner Fund is expected to remain very low until regulation is extended to all childminders and bespoke training and qualifications are developed for childminders. Currently there are 77 Tusla-registered childminders. In line with commitments in First 5 and the Programme for Government, a Childminding Action Plan is currently being finalised, with a view to publication in the near future.

The childminder or potential childminder must mind at least 3 children on a part-time basis or one child on a full-time basis and one part-time. In order to receive the maximum grant available, a childminder must have appropriate insurance and undertake to stay in operation for two years after the date of the grant. The Grant assists childminders with the cost of safety items, equipment, play resources or minor household adaptations. </p>  <p>  The Learner Fund bursary for childminders is available for childminders who achieve a level 5 or level 6 major award in early childhood care and education recognised on the National Framework of Qualifications and who are registered with Tusla. Childminders can also avail of the Learner Fund graduate bursary for level 7/8/9 major awards in early learning and care and who are registered with Tusla.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, as part of the Re-opening Funding Package for Childcare Services, the Covid&ndash;19 Capital Grant and the Re-opening Support Payment were available for childminders that were in contract for DCEDIY programmes and closed their childminding business on 25 March 2020 due to the Covid&ndash;19 pandemic. As part of the Funding Package a Childminding Re-opening Grant was available for childminders who were not in contract for DCEDIY programmes and were ineligible for the Covid-19 Capital Grant or the Re-opening Grant. This Funding Package facilitated the reopening of early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) services from 29 June onwards. This funding supported providers to reopen, staff to remain in the sector, parents to resume work and children to benefit from quality ELC and SAC.</p></reply>

A childminder is exempt from regulation and registration with Tusla if the childminder:</p>  <p>  - Is a relative of the child/children or a spouse of a relative;</p>  <p>  - Takes care of one or more children of the same family and no other such children (other than the childminder's own children); or</p>  <p>  - Takes care of not more than 6 children, of whom not more than 3 are pre-school children, of different families (other than the childminder's own children).</p>  <p>  Prior to February 2019, only (non-relative) childminders who cared for more than three pre-school children of different families were subject to regulation and therefore required to register with Tusla. From February 2019, when Section 22 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 came into force, the scope of regulation has been broadened also to include a (non-relative) childminder who cares for more than six children of any age at one time, in addition to those who care for more than three pre-school children. </p>  <p>  A number of City/County Childcare Committees operate a voluntary notification system for childminders who are legally exempt from registration. Other City/County Childcare Committees maintain lists of childminders to whom they offer supports and information. There are currently 308 childminders who are voluntarily notified to their local City/County Childcare Committee, and a further 750 childminders are currently engaging with the City/County Childcare Committees for support and information.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to Childminding Ireland for the provision of ongoing training, supports and information to childminders. Childminding Ireland has approximately 700 members and provides supports and information to an additional 1,300 childminders.</p></reply>

As part of its work, the Working Group carried out a consultation with parents through a parents&rsquo; survey in May 2017, and consulted childminders through a survey of Childminding Ireland members and a discussion day that allowed more in-depth discussions with 22 childminders from around the country. It also drew on the findings of the consultation with 177 children aged 5-12 that was undertaken in 2016 to inform the Action Plan on School-Age Childcare. The parent&rsquo;s survey had 3,630 responses, and asked questions about use of childminding and attitudes towards childminding. The survey of childminders had 357 responses. </p><p>All aspects of both the 2018 and 2019 public consultation processes are being taken into consideration in the revision and finalisation of the Childminding Action Plan.</p></reply>

It prohibits discrimination on nine grounds including that of disability.  Discrimination on the ground of disability includes a refusal or failure by a service provider to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of a disabled person by providing special treatment or facilities, if without such facilities it would be impossible or unduly difficult for the person to avail himself or herself of the service.  However, service providers are not obliged to provide special facilities or treatment when this costs more than what is called a &lsquo;nominal cost&rsquo;. A nominal cost will be different for each person or organisation as it depends on the size of the business and its budget.</p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is the independent body responsible for investigating complaints of discrimination under the Equal Status Acts.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific issue raised in relation to hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation and the provision of wheelchair hoists, the Technical Guidance Document for Part M of the 2010 Building Regulations does not require that a hoist be provided in hotel or guest accommodation. The Document  does provide for space to enable a wheelchair user to manoeuvre at the side of a bed and transfer independently to it. Additionally, the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design (at the National Disability Authority) has published a best practice guidance document &lsquo;Building for Everyone: A Universal Design Approach&rsquo;, which advises on the amount of space to be included to facilitate wheelchair users in hotel and guest house accommodation. A larger amount of space is recommended where a mobile hoist is provided.</p></reply>

For the vast majority of workers, conditions of employment, including bereavement leave provisions, are matters for negotiation between employers and employees. In the absence of any such provisions in an employment contract, bereavement leave is normally granted at the discretion of the employer. </p>  <p>  The Bill mentioned by the Deputy was a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill introduced by Minister Rabbitte prior to her entering office as Minister for Disability.  The Bill is not included on the Government's legislative list but will be kept under review.</p></reply>

This will ensure that a coherent process is in place for both the health and non-health aspects required in formalised assessments. </p>  <p>  To assist in determining how best we can meet the health and related needs of applicants, the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving our existing processes and I look forward to the outcome of this research.</p>  <p>  At present every effort is made to ensure that residents' specific needs are met. My Department officials routinely identify vulnerabilities and assess applicants for any special reception needs to meet their accommodation requirements. This is especially the case for families with young children and for applicants with a disability.</p>  <p>  If a protection applicant chooses to accept an offer of accommodation from my Department, they will, in normal circumstances, be first brought to the National Reception Centre in Balseskin, Dublin. At Balseskin, they will be offered a health assessment by the on-site HSE team, which comprises a nurse, nurse specialist, area medical officer, general practitioners, social worker and psychologist. This ensures that applicants can be assessed for any special reception needs that they may have before they are designated an accommodation centre. </p>  <p>  Safetynet, a primary care health service, carries out health screening, on behalf of the HSE, in a number of the temporary accommodation locations currently in use by the Department. The International Protection Accommodation Service work closely with the HSE screening team and with Safetynet to ensure that protection applicants are moved to locations where their medical needs can be met. We also work collaboratively to ensure that any special accommodation arrangements are in place as required. </p>  <p>  During the COVID pandemic, assessments have also been made for our older residents to ensure that their cocooning needs are met. Where more intensive healthcare needs are required, such cases are referred directly to the HSE.</p></reply>

In addition to funding universal youth services aimed at all young people, my Department funds targeted youth services through the UBU Your Place Your Space scheme. Under this scheme, &euro;38.7million was allocated in 2020 to support young people between the ages of 10 and 24 who are at risk of becoming disadvantaged, marginalised or vulnerable.</p>  <p>  The UBU Your Place Your Space scheme is underpinned by the Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement (APNASR) process. The APNASR Tool supports each Education and Training Board (ETB) to gather and use available demographic data and local knowledge to produce an area profile of their functional area. The ETB then carries out an analysis of the data to identify the needs of young people in that area.  This results in a Service Requirement for new or existing projects that will be funded by the Department under UBU. The approach ensures that we can target supports to the young people most in need of intervention and that funding is allocated in a transparent and objective manner.</p>  <p>  There is no specific or singular focus on social housing need. However, this indicator is incorporated into the process as part of the Pobal HP Deprivation Index, which is a constituent part of the overall APNASR process. At the discretion of the ETB, local plans, reports and other indicators may be considered as part of the quantitative data gathering, which may or may not include social housing need indicators. </p>  <p>  The UBU Your Place Your Space scheme operates on a cyclical basis, with cycle two commencing on 1 January 2023. The next iteration of the APNASR process will be developed in advance of cycle two and will seek to include relevant quantitative data indicators.</p></reply>

In order to gain entry into an undergraduate medicine degree programme in Ireland, students are required to apply through the Central Applications Office (CAO) and meet the necessary entry requirements which includes completing the Health Professions Admission Test (HPAT). </p><p>Graduate Entry Medicine is offered in four higher education institutions including University College Dublin, University College Cork, University of Limerick and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. Applicants who have completed an NFQ Level 8 (minimum 2.1 award) or equivalent in their first undergraduate degree can apply for entry to graduate medicine. Applicants are also required to sit the GAMSAT (Graduate Medical School Admission Test). </p><p>HEIs operate access and foundation courses that act as an alternative means of entry for students to higher education courses. Many HEIs also participate in the Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) and Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) schemes which offer places on courses on a reduced points basis to school leavers from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and students with disabilities. The operation of HEAR and DARE schemes, the number of places available and which courses are covered is a matter for each HEI.</p><p>It is estimated that the average cost of a medical student is c. &euro;25,000 - &euro;30,000 per student per year.</p><p>In light of the stronger than usual set of Leaving Certificate results received this year as a results of Calculated Grades, a decision was made that additional places would be made available on high-demand higher education courses in order to ease anxieties among students and offset pressures on the system.</p><p>After engagement with HEIs to identify where there was capacity in the system to create these places, given financial support from DFHERIS, 2,225 additional places were made available in advance of Round One offers. These places were created in a broad range of courses across many disciplines, and include courses in areas of very high demand such as healthcare, science and teacher education. </p><p>The cost of these places to the end of 2020 is approximately &euro;7 million, which will be met from the Department&rsquo;s existing allocation. The cost in 2021, to the end of the 2020/21 academic year is estimated at &euro;20 million and this funding has been secured in Budget 2021. Funding of &euro;27 million per academic year thereafter will be needed for the duration of these courses.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the fee payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors including the type of course and the student's access route including previous education.</p><p>Under the Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes, the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate Higher Education students with students paying the student contribution. The student contribution fee is currently set at &euro;3,000 per annum and can be paid in instalments. In addition, the Exchequer pays the contribution in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students eligible for free fees.</p><p>Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the HEA. Currently, the subsidy is &euro;11,200 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p><p>Where students do not qualify for free fees funding, they pay the appropriate fee, either EU or Non-EU, as determined by each HEI. The institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees scheme is a matter for the relevant institution to determine in accordance with their own criteria.</p><p>An annual quota applies to the intake of EU students to medical education in the State. Thereafter, the number of places allocated to non-EU students is a matter for the individual HEI concerned with the availability of clinical placements being an important factor in this regard.</p><p>In broader terms the HEA has also provided data detailing course enrolments on health and welfare related courses in higher education in 2018/2019.  See below.</p></reply>

To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression. The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority. </p><p>One of the criteria in the student grant scheme relates to 'progression'. This means that a student must be moving from year to year within a course, having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another, where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course. The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. I understand from the details supplied that the student in question already holds a Level 8 and a Level 9 qualification. If an individual already holds a qualification, s/he is not eligible for funding at the same level again.</p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter in the first instance for the grant awarding authority, Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI).  If the person to whom the Deputy refers is ineligible for a SUSI grant then there are some other options which could be pursued. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware that in July I announced a funding package of &euro;168m for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>The &euro;168m funding package also includes &euro;15m in IT equipment grants for disadvantaged students in further and higher education and a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. An additional &euro;3m has also been provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives. </p><p>As announced as part of Budget 2021 we will provide financial assistance through a once off &euro;50 million fund for students to mitigate against the impacts of the changed learning environment. My officials and I are developing the process on how this once-off fund will operate for submission to Government prior to commencement. Further details will be available for student shortly.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

This was established to meet an identified need for applicants who choose to engage the assistance of their public representatives in making enquiries about their grant applications.</p>  <p>  This service, which was set up at the behest of Oireachtas members, complements the established channels provided by SUSI which include online application tracking, a dedicated website, a telephone helpdesk, email and social media, including Facebook and Twitter. Enquiries may be emailed direct to SUSI at oireachtas@susi.ie. Staff in SUSI are responding to email queries within a matter of days.</p>  <p>  In general, for student grant purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or a legal guardian, or as independent mature students.   </p>  <p>  A student may be assessed as an independent student (i.e. assessed without reference to parental income and address) if he/she has attained the age of 23 on the 1st of January of the year of first entry to an approved course, and is not ordinarily resident with his/her parents from the previous 1st October. Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. </p>  <p>  A student&rsquo;s status for grant purposes is defined at their first point of entry to an approved further or higher education course or at their point of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and continues to apply for the duration of their studies. </p>  <p>  However, there are points at which a student may reclassify from a dependent student to an independent student. These are where he/she:</p>  <p>  - Progresses from further education to higher education.</p>  <p>  - Is returning following a 3 year break in studies.  </p>  <p>  - Is returning as a"second chance" student after a five year break in studies.</p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for student grant applications is a matter for the centralised grant awarding authority, SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland).    </p>  <p>  Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student. The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. </p>  <p>  Further information regarding class of applicant (independent or dependent) and the types of documentation accepted as evidence of living independently from parents is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website: https://susi.ie/eligibility/applicant-class/ </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific application, I have been advised by my officials that the student in question submitted an application to SUSI on 15th July 2020. Subsequently a checklist letter was sent to the student requesting evidence of independent residence for 2019 and 2020, evidence of residency and evidence of previous and current education. The documentation received by SUSI re independent residence were deemed insufficient to confirm independent residence and a letter advising ineligibility was sent to the student on 14th October 2020.  SUSI received a Notice of Appeal from the student on 2nd November 2020 and the application is currently queued for review by the Appeals Officer who undertakes to respond to all Appeals in writing within 30 days of receipt.</p>  <p>  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant). Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie. </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, I recently announced plans to review the SUSI scheme.  It is intended that the Review will commence before the end of 2020, and will report in Summer 2021.  Stakeholders will be consulted as part of the Review process, and it is intended that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the Review.</p>  <p>  The existing rules reflect the fact that very significant numbers of third-level students move out of home to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents, where their parents have sufficient means, while in full-time education. Therefore, any proposed changes would need careful consideration. The forthcoming Review of the SUSI scheme provides a suitable means to do so. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.</p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Information is sought at the point of registration on any additional supports that may be needed due to disability.

Currently a total of 535 apprentices have reported one or more disabilities, and are receiving additional supports. </p>  <p>  SOLAS conducted a review on Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship which was published in 2018.  It highlighted 5 areas for action and implementing the actions outlined in the report is ongoing. Initiatives underway include: </p>  <p>  - A total of 300 learners availed of dedicated pre-apprenticeship training in 2019, growing to 580 places in 2020. </p>  <p>  - SOLAS, in partnership with the HEA and with the support of the Apprenticeship Council, intends to continue developing access pathways with all providers, including TU Dublin, during 2020 and into the 2020-2021 academic year. </p>  <p>  - 963 Employers have registered with www.apprenticejobs.ie which is designed to increase visibility of opportunities for all potential apprentices. </p>  <p>  - Broader approaches to widening access to apprenticeships also include developing links between Youthreach and Community Training Centre (CTC) provision. </p>  <p>  - The roll out of the 2020 Generation Apprenticeship competition at second level with 156 second level schools, Youthreach Centres and Community Training Centres </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Programme for Government, a new Action Plan for Apprenticeship is in development to cover the period 2021-2025 with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025. The plan will also set out how the apprentice population more closely reflect the general population and offer targeted supports for under-represented groups, including those with disabilities. Stakeholder submissions and a review of the current position of the Pathways findings and recommendations will be used to inform the new action plan which is due to be finalised by year end.</p></reply>

The Protocol is intended to ensure strict precautions are taken to provide the highest standards of safety in the sales, lettings, valuations and managements of properties in the best interest of clients, consumers, employees, employers and those who are categorised as being at risk or at high risk of Covid-19.</p><p>This document gives detailed guidelines for consideration prior to arranging a viewing of a property, what happens during a viewing, post viewing tasks and what to do when a rental agreement is reached including: </p><p>- Confirm whether respective client is cocooning or in an at risk category and if so, identify any additional precautionary measures that may be required.</p><p>- Agree with the owner/occupier that they will not be in the property at the time of viewing.</p><p>- Agree with owner/occupier and note all touch points in the dwelling for the property service provider (PSP) to sanitise after viewing (e.g. door handles, light switches etc.).</p><p>- Agree with owner/occupier the use of official Covid-19 signage at locations throughout the property to act as a useful reminder to viewers to follow the HSE rules.</p><p>- Pre-booked private appointment viewings only.</p><p>- Contact viewer(s) in advance to confirm booking and advise of controls in place and that HSE Covid-19 official instructions must be adhered to during viewings.</p><p>- PSPs should ask viewers to remain a reasonable distance from the property (e.g. remain in car) until given permission by the PSP to enter the property .</p><p>On 23 October 2020, the PSRA in association with IPAV and SCSI issued the &ldquo;Property Services Providers' Guidance to Implementing Plan for Living with Covid 19&rdquo; to all PSPs.  This document outlines that under Level 5 restrictions, viewings by the public of properties for sale are permitted by appointment only where: </p><p>- Confirmation provided of (a) proof of funds (b) property previously viewed online. </p><p>- Time restricted appointments with sufficient time allowed between appointments to avoid any potential cross over of viewers. </p><p>- Viewings by one party of two people from the same household is only permitted.</p><p>The following arrangements apply for property for rent:</p><p>- Properties to be viewed online </p><p>- No viewings in person permitted except: </p> <blockquote> 	- Where the potential tenant has been offered the property.

These recommendations, along with all other recommendations relevant to the work of my Department will be actively considered by a Programme Board I have established for this purpose. Their work will feed into the development of the White Paper by the end of this year, in line with the Programme for Government commitment.   </p>  <p>  My objective is to have decisions on international protection applications and permission to remain considerations made as soon as is possible. This ensures that those who are found to be in need of our protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security. For those found not to be in need of protection, we can offer them assistance to return to their home country. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to processing applications for international protection at first instance with the aim to reduce median processing times to 9 months or below as soon as possible. It also commits to ensuring that additional resources designated for the International Protection Office (IPO) are deployed in the most efficient and effective way possible to increase the output of quality decisions. I was pleased to secure an additional &euro;1.75m in Budget 2021 for the efficient functioning of the international protection system, which will help us to further improve processing times for applications.</p>  <p>  Enhanced use of technology and ICT as part of the processing of applications are central to reducing waiting times for decisions. The IPO has already begun to hold virtual interviews with some applicants living outside of Dublin and has put in place a range of measures to create processing efficiencies across a number of work streams such as accelerated procedures, implementation of non-cooperation measures, and initiatives to speed up the return of completed questionnaires. Other options being explored include greater automation of the process including ICT improvements, revision of key documentation and greater use of remote interviewing. </p>  <p>  Efforts to improve processing times have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced the output of decisions considerably and has impacted on the target set by the IPO to make  first instance decisions in the vast majority of cases within 9 months.  COVID-19 has also impacted those applications at appeal stage. </p>  <p>  The IPO&rsquo;s main focus going forward is to get its processing system functioning as effectively and efficiently as possible, while adhering to all measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19.  However, it must be acknowledged that the processing of applications is complex and that each application deserves and receives an individual assessment.</p></reply>

The audit will be undertaken by an external consultant with meaningful involvement from relevant NGOs and service providers, as well as input from Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the audit have been finalised, and a procurement process to engage an independent person to undertake the audit has commenced with details available on my Department's website (www.justice.ie). It is intended that the audit will be completed within 3 months of commissioning and the findings of it will be presented to Government before the end of March 2021 in line with the commitment made. </p>  <p>  The Deputies may also be aware that, over the last decade, work in this area has been conducted through successive DSGBV strategies. My Department coordinates the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, which is a whole-of-Government approach to delivering on the many actions necessary to address these matters fully. </p>  <p>  The Strategy includes input from relevant community and voluntary groups as well as other stakeholders across the sector. This is achieved through a Monitoring Committee composed of stakeholders from all sectors working together in partnership; as well as ongoing cooperation between the Department and frontline services and industry partners.  The Monitoring Committee and the NGOs represented on it are key partners for my Department in our work to tackle DSGBV and will be a primary focus of our consultations in the audit process. I can confirm for the Deputy that the organisation referred to is a member of the Monitoring Committee. </p>  <p>  Overall, the Strategy aims to considerably strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy. </p>  <p>  Without prejudice to the outcome of the audit, a review of the outstanding actions has been conducted to inform the forthcoming 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV, to be developed and agreed by Government before the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  As part of the ensuring a national response to domestic violence, my Department in 2020 provided just over &euro;2 million in funding to support training and awareness initiatives in relation to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and &euro;1.9 million euro in funding to support victims of crime, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. This year I have secured funding of over &euro;2 million for combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and &euro;2.1 million to support victims of crime. In addition, I have secured &euro;2.3 million to implement Supporting a Victims Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases which I published last month.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Supporting a Victims Journey&rsquo; will be implemented as a priority and it includes the provision of specific training for all of the key personnel a victim comes into contact with during the course of their journey throughout the criminal justice system. Such personnel includes the Garda&iacute;, the DPP, the judiciary and the legal profession. Engagement on development of training programmes for serving Garda&iacute;, the legal professions and members of the judiciary who are participating in sexual offences investigations and trials has already started, and I expect this training will be further rolled out in 2021.</p>  <p>  The Deputies may also be interested to know that the rollout of the Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now complete with DPSUs in every Garda division across the country. The completion of the rollout of DPSUs means that specially trained officers are available nationwide who will be responsible for engagement with, and interviewing of, vulnerable victims.  This will ensure that when vulnerable victims of crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual violence present to Garda&iacute;, they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist professional and expert assistance.</p></reply>

The increase in domestic abuse incidents during the pandemic has been born out in figures reported by frontline services, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, by statistics released by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, by the courts and most recently by the Director of Public Prosecutions at the annual Prosecutors Conference.</p>  <p>  Tackling domestic abuse and supporting victims is a key priority for me as Minister for Justice and for the Government as a whole.  This is true in terms of commitments and additional resources made available during the pandemic and as regards the longer-term planning to ensure we have a comprehensive and holistic approach to the provision of services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence and a system that support vulnerable victims at every point throughout the criminal justice system. </p>  <p>  While for most people the advice was to &lsquo;stay home, stay safe&rsquo;, my Department recognised at he outset of the restriction on movement that for those for whom domestic abuse is a risk, home could be far from safe. In recognition of this, my Department developed an inter-agency plan to address and prioritise tackling domestic abuse during the pandemic, and is leading efforts to identify lessons which can be learned, with input from the community and voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  During the pandemic my Department provided additional resources, support, enforcement and services to key organisations in the area of domestic, sexual and gender based violence in order for them to adapt and respond to the increased demand for services during this period. This support is maintained and increased in budget 2021 and I can assure the Deputy that domestic abuse was of primary consideration in the context of the move to level 5 in the National Framework for Living with Covid-19.  </p>  <p>  My Department initiated and continues to run the 'Still Here' public awareness campaign, in partnership with public sector organisations and the NGO sector. The &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo; campaign is about getting the message out that services continue to be available to victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence and to spread the message that the COVID travel restrictions do not apply to victims of domestic abuse seeking help.</p>  <p>  During the pandemic, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have continuously attached the highest priority to domestic abuse through Operation Faoiseamh&rsquo;, which is an active, ongoing operation and both the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board are prioritising domestic abuse cases. The Legal Aid board has established a Helpline to ensure victims of domestic abuse get legal advice and representation in proceedings where required.  </p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy, but more importantly to reassure anyone who is a victim, or at risk of, domestic or sexual abuse, that help continues to be available. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts and other services, including the vital supports provided by our highly skilled and committed community and voluntary services are "Still Here" for them - regardless of the level of restriction the country is at.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that primary responsibility for funding frontline services, including refuges for victims of domestic abuse, rests with Tusla and I understand that in addition to the &euro;25.3 million of funding provided by Tusla for frontline services in 2020, an additional &euro;2 million euro was provided in Covid specific funding.</p>  <p>  In relation to funding more generally, in 2020, my Department committed almost &euro;1.9 million to support services for victims of crime, including sexual and gender based violence.  These services provide important information and support to victims of crime, including emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, counselling and referral to other services. &euro;2 million has been allocated to support such services for victims of crime in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  I have also secured just over &euro;2 million euro in Budget 2021 for combatting domestic sexual and gender based violence and an additional &euro;2.3 million to support the implementation of the O'Malley review which will support vulnerable victims, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. </p>  <p>  I recently published Supporting A Victims Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases which is a detailed roadmap for the introduction of the recommendations contained in the O'Malley review which, when implemented, will  protect vulnerable witnesses, during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. This work is being  progressed as a priority under the Programme for Government commitments in consultation with our stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  As regards planning for the future, the Programme for Government commits to an audit of how domestic, sexual and gender based violence services are organised. Terms of reference have been agreed and the Department of Justice has commenced a procurement process to engage an independent consultant to undertake the audit. Candidates have 3 weeks to apply and the contract will be awarded before the end of the year with a requirement to conduct the audit within 3 months. The audit will include input from all stakeholders and will be presented before the end of March 2021 in line with the Programme for Government commitment. </p>  <p>  Without prejudice to the outcome of the audit, the Programme for Government also commits to the development of the third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence, which will place a priority on prevention and reduction and will include a National Preventative Strategy. A review of the outstanding actions has been conducted to inform the forthcoming 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV, to be developed and agreed by Government before the end of 2021.</p></reply>

I am informed that under the Irish Prison Service complaints policy there are six categories of complaints. The most serious is Category A and these are referred to investigators independent of the Prison Service. A prisoner may also write to the Inspector of Prisons and the DG of the IPS if they are subsequently unhappy with the outcome of an investigation of a Category A complaint. </p>  <p>  Arising from concerns expressed by a prisoner in the D&oacute;chas Centre in July of this year and given the seriousness of the allegations, the Irish Prisons Service initiated a Category A investigation into the specific case using an independent external examiner. This investigation has now concluded and the outcome of this investigation is under review.  </p>  <p>  A separate investigation under Section 31(2) of the Prisons Act 2007 is also underway by the Inspector of Prisons. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of reference for the investigation, the original target for a preliminary report was the end of October. However, the Inspector indicated that she will require further time to conclude the investigation, and a report is now expected in early December.</p>  <p>  Upon receipt of that report, I will consider what further action may be warranted and appropriate.</p>  <p>  Given the circumstances and as the Deputy may appreciate, it would be wholly inappropriate for me to comment or go into the detail of any individual allegation or ongoing investigation. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am regularly briefed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service, as well as senior officials in my Department, in regards to all relevant matters pertaining to the good governance and operation of the Irish Prison system. The Irish Prison Service is committed to the provision of safe, secure and humane custody for people who are sent to prison in this State.  The Deputy will be aware of their outstanding record of safeguarding those in their care during the current pandemic.</p></reply>

However, I am aware that there has been some attention on issues arising in the context of video gaming. In particular, whether in-game purchases or micro-transactions, described as "loot boxes", "skins" etc., designed to improve the players&rsquo; chances of success in inter-active online games, might encourage gambling like behaviour. </p>  <p>  The issue is whether such micro-transactions constitute gambling or are a form of e-commerce.  It is not clear that these offers fall within the current Irish legal definition of gambling or that purchases are essentially an e-commerce activity. </p>  <p>  Different approaches have been adopted to the issue of whether and how "loot boxes" might be defined and regulated in the context of gambling activities in Europe, with no definitive outcomes. This matter is one which my Department and ultimately the new Gambling Regulator will keep under review. </p>  <p>  This is a position, which is shared by other EU Member States. Ireland supported the 2018 Declaration by the Gaming Regulators European Forum that video gaming products should be licensed and regulated appropriately, if they can be shown to fall into the category of gambling. In preparing the declaration, member states were aware of reports that third party actors, not authorised by the video game developer or under their control, may seek to commercialise certain elements of video gaming in a manner akin to gambling. </p>  <p>  With regard to protection of children and age limits for video games, the Pan-European Game Information (PEGI) age rating system was established in 2003 to help European parents make informed decisions on buying computer games. It replaced a number of national age rating systems with a single system now used throughout most of Europe, in more than 35 countries including Ireland. However, &lsquo;gambling&rsquo;, for the purposes of PEGI video game rating, is based on whether there are depictions of gambling in the game that can be found in real life, e.g. casino type games. It is not clear that PEGI (which is a voluntary code of the industry, rather than state mandated) could or would put such gambling related warnings on games containing Loot Boxes as these are discretionary purchases by the player. I encourage parents to ensure that their children only engage in appropriate gaming and are not making purchases unknown to them.</p></reply>

I understand that Shane was an exceptional young man and his death nine years ago at the age of just 23 was a terrible tragedy.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a retired Judge, Gerard Haughton, is currently conducting a scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding Shane's death.  The Judge furnished an interim report to my predecessor last November.  Following consultation between the Judge, Shane's family and the Attorney General, the interim report was published on 17 December 2019. </p>  <p>  In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  My Department maintains regular contact with the Judge and has assured him that any assistance he requires to complete his final report will be made available. However, given the COVID-19 restrictions, the Judge has recently informed my Department that it is likely to be mid-December before he will be in a position to conclude the scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that it is open to the Judge to make any recommendation he sees fit in his final report, including the establishment of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that it is only appropriate that I await the recommendation of the final report of this scoping exercise before making any decision in relation to further inquiries into this matter.</p></reply>

On the second occasion, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have discretion to issue an Adult Caution. </p>  <p>  An implementation, monitoring and evaluation group, chaired by the Department of Health, is implementing the health diversion programme. The Group is developing proposals to commence implementation of the programme on an administrative basis in a number of locations throughout the country in 2021. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Programme for Government, a review of the programme will take place following the first full year of implementation, to ensure that it is meeting all of its aims.</p>  <p>  I am committed to a health-led approach for possession of drugs for personal use, and I look forward to the commencement of the health diversion programme in 2021.</p></reply>

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>At Level 5 of the Plan, only essential retail outlets and essential services are allowed to open to the public.

The National Breastfeeding Coordinators team in the HSE have regular links with the Health Promotion Advisor in Health and Wellbeing in the Department.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Breastfeeding in a Healthy Ireland &ndash; HSE Action Plan 2016-2021 includes initiatives in the following areas:</p>  <p>  1. Improved governance and health service structures</p>  <p>  2. Breastfeeding training and skills development</p>  <p>  3. Health service policies and practices</p>  <p>  4. Support at all stages of the breastfeeding continuum through social marketing, support and advocacy.</p>  <p>  The HSE is partnering with key stakeholders to develop the supports that mothers require at all stages of the breastfeeding continuum through social marketing, support and advocacy. The www.mychild.ie website provides pregnant and new mothers and families with a range of information and supports about infant feeding. An Ask Our Expert (AOE) on-line service, provided by International Board-Certified Lactation Consultants, is available to answer mothers' questions and link them to supports in their local area. The webchat facility and HSE breastfeeding Facebook page is also available. These services provide supportive and practical expert information in a friendly, supportive and non-judgemental manner.</p>  <p>  The Maternity Strategy states that "in addition to practical supports which can be provided to mothers, such as support to continue breastfeeding on return to the workplace, a broader societal change in required in order to promote a more positive culture around breastfeeding. This should support women to feel confident about their choice to breastfeed". In essence, this means that all mothers should be supported to breastfeed at anytime and anywhere.</p>  <p>  The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 re-affirmed the commitment to advance public support of breastfeeding and includes an action to extend provision for breastfeeding breaks under employment legislation (currently available to mothers of children under 6 months).</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Women and Infants Health Programme, in collaboration with health promotion and improvement and public health services in the HSE, supports the implementation of the WHO/UNICEF 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding using a model suitable for the promotion and support of breastfeeding in Ireland. This approach is also examining the option of an all-island approach.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that that breastfeeding will remain a priority and the Department of Health and the HSE will continue working to achieve the aims and objectives of the Breastfeeding in a Healthy Ireland &ndash; HSE Action Plan 2016-2021.</p></reply>

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. </p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.</p>  <p>  Deliveries of this vaccine from the manufacturer were not as quick as we would have liked, due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines.  It is also true that demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond, and in this context it is unlikely that additional supply will become available.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm that 1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites since early October.  In addition, 420,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed. </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be distributed and administered. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. </p>  <p>  Each year a certain amount of vaccine is &ldquo;held back&rdquo; to ensure those in at-risk groups receive vaccines. With the unprecedented demand this year it is important that the HSE manage the distribution of the remaining doses in order to target administration to the at-risk groups who need it the most. The distribution of the final 50,000 doses will commence by the end of this month. The significant increase in uptake among those in the at-risk groups, combined with the addition of vaccination for children aged from 2 to 12, will help reduce the impact of influenza on the community and the health system.</p>  <p>  Vaccinations are ordered well in advance &ndash; the HSE placed its order for the vaccine for those in at-risk groups in February. The HSE order for the 2020/21 season was 20% greater than the order for the 2019/20 season and about 35% more than 2019/20 uptake. These figures do not include the additional 600,000 doses of vaccine ordered for children aged from 2 &ndash; 12, which would bring to almost 75% the additional number of doses of vaccine available this year. Given the demand on the international market for influenza vaccine, it is not realistically possible to procure more vaccine at this point.</p>  <p>  When the vaccination programme is complete, we will have vaccinated more people in at-risk groups than ever before.  Current trends suggest that at least 350,000 more individuals in the at-risk groups will receive the flu vaccine this winter than last, including those over 65 and healthcare workers. In addition, over 100,000 children have already received the vaccination which is being provided without charge this year for the first time.  I expect this number to increase significantly in the coming weeks also.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised regarding a patient appointment, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The expert guidance of the  European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in particular is based upon consideration of the circumstances arising in the European Union and globally.

These services are provided by over 1,400 independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. I understand that since the beginning of March, 165 dentists have withdrawn from the DTSS and that 58 new applications are being processed. This is within the normal range of fluctuations of dentists participating in the Scheme in recent years. </p>  <p>  The interruption to services caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic has meant that some patients had to wait longer than usual for appointments. However, there are positive signs of the profession having adapted to provide oral health care and of patients availing of care in recent months. The resumption in activity is evidenced by the increasing claims by dentists during the year; in June, claims were 27% of the level for the previous year; the corresponding figure for October was 93%. </p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging with dentists throughout the pandemic and is preparing for further engagement on any additional measures to support the oral health of the public during these difficult times.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-17a.1919.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111700097#WRKK03700"><p>Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, the HSE does have a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed. There are currently almost 1,800 such medical cards awarded. Separately, terminally ill patients who do not meet the end of life criteria may also qualify for a medical card under the general assessment processes. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a commitment to extend discretionary medical cards to those with a terminal illness. A HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The final Report of the CAG was recently submitted to my Department which I intend to publish imminently. The Report notes that there are practical and legal challenges with extending eligibility for medical cards for terminally ill patients within the framework of the current process. However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that terminally ill patients have access to the services they need.  In that regard, my Department has devised an ambitious work programme to be initiated immediately, which will look to address the policy and legal findings of the Report and deliver on the Programme for Government commitment.</p></reply>

To develop the elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need, which facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care. </p><p>2. To provide quicker, higher quality, safer care for selected, elective patients.</p><p>3. To create capacity for acute hospital sites and reduce/eliminate outlier boarding (trolleys).</p><p>4. To drive down waiting lists, both outpatient and inpatient/day case.</p><p>5. To reduce cancellations.</p><p>6. To reduce acute hospital footfall. </p><p>The Membership of the Electives Hospitals Oversight Group is as follows: </p><p>Professor Frank Keane (Chair) (Surgeon) </p><p>Laura Magahy (Executive Director, Sl&aacute;intecare )</p><p>Greg Dempsey (Deputy Secretary, DoH)</p><p>Dr Alan Smith (Deputy Chief Medical Officer, DoH)</p><p>Dr Vida Hamilton (National Clinical Advisor and Group Lead Acute Operations, HSE) </p><p>Dean Sullivan (Chief Strategy and Planning Officer, HSE)</p><p>Yvonne Goff (Director of Integrated Information Service and Scheduled Care Transformation Programme, HSE)</p><p>Paul De Freine (Chief Architectural Adviser, HSE Estates)</p><p>Mr Kenneth Mealy (Surgeon)</p><p>Aonraid Dunne (Principal Officer, Capital/infrastructure, Strategy and Policy Division, DoH)</p><p>Andrew Conlon (Principal Officer, Acute Hospitals Policy Division, DoH) </p><p>Administrative and specialist support has been provided by SPIO, RCSI, and the HSE. </p><p>The Oversight Group is following the process outlined in the Public Spending Code. As required under the Code, members of the SPIO and the EHOG drafted a Strategic Assessment Report for the development of Elective Hospital facilities. This sets out the rationale for investment, the alignment of the programme with strategic requirements of Government, some initial options and potential costs, and the governance of the programme. This document is complete and is going through the approval channels. </p><p>A high-level facilities Spatial brief, including costs, a functional description and process flow, a site options appraisal and a Preliminary Business Case (PBC) in accordance with the public spending code is also under preparation. This will be delivered before the end of 2020.</p></reply>

Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018.  At the end of September 2020 there were 5,013 patients waiting compared to 6,626 in September 2018.</p><p>In considering these figures it is important to recognise that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic this year. The HSE had to take measures to defer most routine scheduled care activity in March, April, and May. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and urgent time-critical work.

Within weeks of the first wave of the pandemic, solutions such as telehealth and electronic transfer of prescriptions were implemented, followed shortly afterwards by the COVID Tracker app, designed to support contact tracing.</p><p>The COVID Tracker App was developed to provide people with information about the rate of spread of infection, to enable them to self report symptoms and to alert them of close contacts with others who have since been diagnosed Covid positive. The app was the result fo close collaboration and joint development between the  Department of Health, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the HSE, the innovation unit at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Science Foundation Ireland and academia, working closely with technical partners from the private sector including Nearform (a Waterford based app development company), Apple and Google.  By international comparison, it has been very successful with over 2 million downloads and more than 1.3 million active users.</p><p>The HSE developed an enterprise wide CRM solution to manage and track COVID patients as they move through the COVID care pathway. This is the 'radar' system that enables the health system to manage patient calls to the call center and interactions at test centres, assessment hubs and other covid related facilities.</p><p>The clinical management of COVID care has been assisted by the implementation of:</p><p>- electronic ordering of COVID tests and electronic tracking and reporting of results; </p><p>- remote working on a large scale by non-patient facing staff;</p><p>- provision of electronic aids to nursing homes and hospitals to help with restricted visiting regimes and enabling patients to stay connected to their families and friends;</p><p>- system and technology deployments to support acute ICU care and community-based services for COVID-19;</p><p>- communication system upgrades. </p><p>The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE) are currently examining the role eHealth and ICT will have to support post-2020 COVID health management activities.  Of immediate priority is the need for systems to support the administration of the Covid vaccine when it becomes available but there will be many other ICT enabled covid actions to be addressed. </p><p>Whilst non-COVID eHealth and ICT supportive projects and programmes are also being examined, many of those activities complement the COVID response and the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.  </p><p>eHealth and ICT Initiatives for 2021 are currently being factored into the HSE service plan for 2021, that is scheduled to be submitted the Department by the end of November.</p></reply>

As of March 2020, when the site closed due to Covid-19, the NPHDB was of the view that the Main Contractor was behind schedule on the construction   works.  </p>  <p>  The current overall capital build cost of the project is &euro;1,433 m.  This includes all of the capital cost for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus which will house the school and third level educational spaces, the two Outpatient Department and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght Hospital campuses, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. </p>  <p>  The &euro; 1.43bn figure on capital cost as set out above does not take account of the impact of COVID on the construction sector, including the NCH. </p>  <p>  In addition to the capital project there is a broader programme of activity associated with the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites under development. This includes investment in ICT, an Electronic Health Record system, the Children's Hospital Integration Programme (the merging of three paediatric hospitals), pre-2013 project expenditure relating to the former Mater project, and the planned construction of the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre to be funded through philanthropic funding. The inclusion of these elements alongside the capital build account for a total overall project cost of &euro;1.73 billion. </p>  <p>  The PwC report makes clear that the Guaranteed Maximum Price established through the two-stage tender process does not provide a contractual ceiling on cost and significant residual risks remain of further cost.  The residual risks, for which there cannot be cost certainty, include items such as construction inflation, claims and certain uncontrollable risks, such as potential costs relating to Brexit. </p>  <p>  The NPHDB is continuing to engage with the Main Contractor to obtain an updated programme of works that is in line with its contractual commitments.  At this point it is still too early to fully assess the final time or costs impact of the pandemic on the project.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The decision to delay appointments and admissions is not undertaken lightly and when such a decision is made, it is based on the safe delivery of care to all patients. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

There are no plans at present to directly employ general practitioners. The 2019 GP Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  The outcome of this review will inform future contractual changes, with preparatory work for the review having begun this year.</p>  <p>  As reflected in the Programme for Government, the Government is committed to increasing access to GP services on a public basis, by extending GP care without charges to more children; an important healthcare measure that will remove a potentially prohibitive cost barrier to accessing GP care and will help to improve children&rsquo;s health as they develop. Ensuring more children have access to GP care without charge is a further step towards the Sl&aacute;intecare Report recommendation for universal access to GP care, which recognises the need for expansion on phased basis.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under. The initial stage of this phased expansion will be the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 and 8. However, the appropriate date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and in anticipation of the usual increase in demand for healthcare services over the winter period.</p></reply>

As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level.  The new Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, recommits to this Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation, stating &ldquo;Enhanced governance and accountability in the health service is a key component of Sl&aacute;intecare reform. The HSE Board is now in place and we must now bring forward detailed proposals on the six new regional health areas to deliver services for patients locally that are safe, high quality and fairly distributed.&rdquo;</p>  <p>   As agreed, when the new Regional Health Areas geographies were announced last summer, a business plan for the establishment of these health areas was expected to be brought to Government for its approval in 2020. The intention was that this plan would set out the high-level organisational design for the health system, including: the respective roles, functions, responsibilities and accountabilities of the Department of Health, HSE centre and new regional structures; the relationship between these entities; and the overall legal construct. Work was underway in the Department of Health and the HSE to develop these detailed proposals, in consultation with stakeholders. Understandably, this work was paused as a result of COVID-19. This programme of work will be given further consideration to take account of the Programme for Government commitment and any new considerations relating to COVID-19.  </p>  <p>   The programme plan to support the development of the Regional Health Areas included a focus on the development of resource allocation modelling on the basis of population needs assessment. One of the goals of the regional devolvement of health services is the concept of &ldquo;one region, one budget&rdquo;.  A key factor in implementing this goal will be determining the methodology and approach to the allocation of resources, on a population basis which takes account of need.  Clearly, the way in which resources are allocated will be determined by the nature of services provided at national, regional and supraregional level, as well as the governance that determines the flow of resources.  It is critical that the approach to resource allocation is equitable, quality-driven, responsive to population health needs, outcomes focussed and sets up regions to deliver best outcomes for available resources.  This will be a significant undertaking but one that is critical to the reorganisation of the health and social care service and the operation of regional structures.  The initial focus of this work will be on conducting an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; mapping of current resource allocation, learning from international approaches, feasibility and readiness assessment and stakeholder engagement.  This will inform and enable work to then commence on specification of a geographic resource allocation formula.</p></reply>

The aim of this anticipated Bill will be to underpin, as required, a new overarching national policy on adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector, which is currently under development by my Department further to a Government Decision in December 2017.  </p>  <p>  A timeline for the preparation of this Bill will be finalised following confirmation of Government approval of this important new sectoral policy. It is currently estimated that the draft policy will be ready for submission to the Government for its approval during 2021, following a public consultation process in early 2021.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, development of an overarching sectoral policy of this nature is a complex undertaking, not least because the health and social care sectoral policy will apply across the full spectrum of the Irish health and social care sector including all public, voluntary and private health and social care services and settings and will include proposals on cooperation, collaboration, information-sharing and referral arrangements between the health and social care sector and other relevant sectors. Accordingly, my Department's approach to date has been to undertake the required detailed policy work before formulating the legislation which will underpin it, including legal and policy research, public and stakeholder consultation and resource implication analysis.  </p>  <p>  Significant preparatory policy development work has been undertaken and the key stakeholder engagement and detailed research phases are essentially complete.  Although, in common with other health and social care sector projects, there has been some degree of disruption arising from the Department&rsquo;s and the wider health system&rsquo;s lead role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, progress with developing the evidence base and policy has continued throughout 2020.  </p>  <p>  I trust this is of assistance to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Act also introduces guiding principles for children and refers to capacity within the meaning of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. The provisions of the 2018 amending Act cannot be commenced until further legislative changes are made and the Decision Support Service, established under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act is operational.  The changes in these two acts are based on a number of different recommendations of the Expert Group Review of the 2001 Act.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently finalising heads of bill to significantly amend and update the mental health legislation, taking into account the 165 recommendations of the Expert Group Review, which was informed in part by a public consultation, a comprehensive submission by the Mental Health Commission (MHC), and Ireland&rsquo;s domestic and international commitments, such as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The provisions of the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018 are also being incorporated into the draft heads of bill.</p>  <p>  There are over one hundred sections in the draft heads. The Department has included detailed information under each head to allow for expert input from the MHC and the HSE to be provided prior to publication, to allow the Department the opportunity to address any concerns earlier in the process. The draft heads of bill propose to extensively amend and update existing mental health legislation, moving from what has been described as a paternalistic approach in existing statute, to a more patient-centric, human rights-based approach. The Department had hoped to submit these heads for legal advice by year-end 2020, however, the Department is currently awaiting further input from the HSE, which is expected in early December and plans to consider the HSE&rsquo;s submission and finalise the draft heads prior to submission for internal legal advice, and to the office of the Attorney General, as required, in early 2021.</p>  <p>  A new Part of the Act related to children is being advanced separately, and the Department has approached the HSE, the Commission, the Ombudsman for Children and the College of Psychiatrists for their expert opinions on draft heads. The Department received the MHC&rsquo;s input this week and expects to receive the remaining draft heads in early December 2020, and the new Part on children will be finalised at the same time as the rest of the heads.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.</p>  <p>   The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019. The Pre-legislative scrutiny Report has yet to be approved by the Committee on Health. Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.</p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p>  <p>  Work on the legislative process with the Office of the Attorney General regarding this Bill has recently resumed.</p>  <p>  This piece of legislation is a priority for the government and will be progressed as soon as possible, to support Farm Families and Businesses.</p></reply>

This means that the pilot is running behind schedule. This is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which as I'm sure the Deputy is aware, resulted in the closure of disability services. The current Level 5 restrictions are also severely impacting with the Health Service Executive's (HSE) ability to meet with individuals and progress.</p><p>The Department of Health, HSE and National Disability Authority (NDA) recommended that a sample size of 180 Personalised Budget packages would be sufficient to demonstrate the models of Personalised Budgets, as set out in the report - Towards Personalised Budgets for People with a Disability in Ireland. In that regard there are many variables that need to be considered for testing within this sample size:</p><p>- Types of Disability - Intellectual Disability, Physical and Sensory Disability, Autism</p><p>- Complexity of Need - High, Medium and Low</p><p>- Models of Personalised Budget - Person Managed Fund, Co Managed with Service Provider, Broker Managed Fund</p><p>- Levels of Governance</p><p>- Elements of Disability Services - Personal Assistance and Home Support, School Leavers,  Other Day Services, Respite and Residential </p><p>- Community Health Organisation delivery systems  - 9 CHOs</p><p>Up to 180 adults with a disability will participate in the Personalised Budget Pilot Demonstration over two phases (2 x 90). The launch of Phase 2 of the pilot commenced on 27th July with a call for Expressions of Interest. The Expressions of Interest application deadline for Phase 2 closed on 7th September, with the HSE receiving 136 applications. As there was a pause in processing applications, due to COVID-19, applications are still being processed.</p><p>Applications were welcomed from adults with a disability that are currently in receipt of HSE funded services; provided either directly by the HSE or through the non-statutory sector (including day services, residential services, respite services, rehabilitative training or personal assistance) and young people leaving school in 2020 that have a commitment to a funded day service.</p></reply>

This Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation. The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>At Level 5 of the Plan, only essential retail outlets and essential services are allowed to open to the public. The list of essential services that can remain open during Level 5 includes therapy services provided by a member of a designated profession within the meaning of section 3 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (No. 27 of 2005).  There are seventeen professions designated under the 2005 Act, which are encompassed in the list of essential services. These are: Dietitians, Dispensing Opticians, Medical Scientists, Occupational Therapists, Optometrists, Physiotherapists (which includes Physical Therapists), Radiographers, Radiation Therapists, Social Workers, Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Biochemists, Counsellors, Orthoptists, Podiatrists, Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Social Care Workers.</p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position.

The Deputy may wish to note that this organisation is funded in the main by TUSLA, which falls under the auspices of the Department of Children. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy could provide some further detail regarding the above issues, I will consider it further. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, I can inform the Deputy that the Department of Health allocation in Budget 2021 includes &euro;50,000 for on-line training programmes for health care professionals dealing with victims of domestic violence. The aim is to ensure that families experiencing, or at risk of experiencing domestic or sexual violence will be supported when they access health services. Further details will be set out in the HSE National Service Plan for 2021, which is to be submitted to the Minister for Health shortly.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is still having a major impact both here in Ireland and elsewhere. </p><p>On Tuesday 15 September the Government published &lsquo;Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19&rsquo;. This Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation. The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>At Level 5 of the Plan, only essential retail outlets and essential services are allowed to open to the public. The list of essential services that can remain open during Level 5 includes therapy services provided by a member of a designated profession within the meaning of section 3 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (No. 27 of 2005).  There are seventeen professions designated under the 2005 Act, which are encompassed in the list of essential services. These are: Dietitians, Dispensing Opticians, Medical Scientists, Occupational Therapists, Optometrists, Physiotherapists (which includes Physical Therapists), Radiographers, Radiation Therapists, Social Workers, Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Biochemists, Counsellors, Orthoptists, Podiatrists, Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Social Care Workers.</p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position. The latest public health advice on these matters is available at the links below and is updated on a regular basis:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and urgent time-critical work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.</p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>In addition the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p><p>The St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital outpatient cardiology waiting list is outlined in the attached document. The latest NTPF figures show that there are currently 343 patients on the St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital OPD cardiology waiting list. Of these, 62% (211) are waiting 6 months or less and 82% (281) are waiting 12 months or less. The St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital OPD cardiology waiting list has decreased by 12%, when compared to the same period last year. The NTPF have advised that the average wait time to see a consultant cardiologist at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Kilkenny is 177 days.</p></reply>

The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  Deliveries of this vaccine from the manufacturer were not as quick as we would have liked, due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines.  It is also true that demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond, and in this context it is unlikely that additional supply will become available.   </p>  <p>  While I cannot comment on individual providers, I can confirm that 1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites since early October.  In addition, 420,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed.  </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be distributed and administered. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. </p>  <p>  Each year a certain amount of vaccine is &ldquo;held back&rdquo; to ensure those in at-risk groups receive vaccines. With the unprecedented demand this year it is important that the HSE manage the distribution of the remaining doses in order to target administration to the at-risk groups who need it the most. The distribution of the final 50,000 doses will commence by the end of this month.   </p>  <p>  The significant increase in uptake among those in the at-risk groups, combined with the addition of vaccination for children aged from 2 to 12, will help reduce the impact of influenza on the community and the health system.</p></reply>

This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to private hospitals, in anticipation of the projected surge in Covid-19 cases and the expected impact on the health care system, a major part of the response was to urgently ramp up capacity for acute hospital care facilities.  A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June.</p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree with the private hospitals a new arrangement which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases. The negotiations are ongoing.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of additional capacity in private hospitals, that would be a matter for the individual private hospitals themselves. The Department of Health does not have a role to play in capacity expansion in private facilities.</p></reply>

It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation. The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>At Level 5 of the Plan, only essential retail outlets and essential services are allowed to open to the public. The list of essential services that can remain open during Level 5 includes therapy services provided by a member of a designated profession within the meaning of section 3 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (No. 27 of 2005).  There are seventeen professions designated under the 2005 Act, which are encompassed in the list of essential services. These are: Dietitians, Dispensing Opticians, Medical Scientists, Occupational Therapists, Optometrists, Physiotherapists (which includes Physical Therapists), Radiographers, Radiation Therapists, Social Workers, Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Biochemists, Counsellors, Orthoptists, Podiatrists, Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Social Care Workers.</p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position.

This service has existed in some form in St Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital for 20 years. Currently, due to the organic development of the Service over time, the National Gender Service operates over two sites: St Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital and St John of God Community Services. </p>  <p>  In order to provide this Service, a specialised multidisciplinary team (MDT) is needed to deliver effective, safe, individualised care. The National Gender Service delivers this care via a Model of Care that incorporates a holistic individualised MDT assessment, support pathways, and gender affirming interventions.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy concerning the National Gender Service, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It is important also to be aware of the need for supports for families who find the topic difficult to discuss. </p><p>A key goal of the National Sexual Health Strategy is that everyone living in Ireland will receive comprehensive, and age-appropriate sexual health education and information. My Department and the HSE's Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) and HSE Education Lead work closely with our partners in the Department of Education to support health and wellbeing in schools, including supports for the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Curriculum, Social and Personal Health Education (SPHE) and Relationship and Sexuality Education (RSE), which is currently being reviewed by the NCCA. </p><p>With regard to the type of information campaigns suggested by the Deputy, the SHCPP has implemented a number of sexual health information campaigns aimed at children and young people, in particular through dedicated websites such as sexualwellbeing.ie and B4UDecide.ie. Wider information for young people is also available through SpunOut.ie.</p><p>In addition to developing resources for schools and for young people themselves, the HSE and SHCPP also work closely with parents to provide support and information. Alongside the report, a series of additional resources, including <i>Busy Bodies</i>and <i>Making the 'Big Talk' Many Small Talks </i>were also launched. These can be used both in schools and at home, providing advice to parents and teachers on discussing relationships and sexuality with children. For more detailed information on these initiatives, I have also asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This includes 600,000 doses of the vaccine delivered via nasal drops to children aged from 2 -12. </p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HSE and the Government is to ensure that all of those most vulnerable to the winter flu will have access to vaccination without charge. This includes all of those in the at-risk groups and healthcare workers. The extension of vaccination to all children aged from 2 to 12 years will provide additional protection, as younger children (along with the elderly) are among those most at-risk from flu.  </p>  <p>  1.35 million doses of the injected vaccine are being made available for those in the HSE-defined at-risk groups, including healthcare workers.  For comparison purposes, just under 1 million doses were administered last winter.  Notwithstanding the large increase in available vaccine this year, it is likely that the full supply will be used, representing an increase of 35% in uptake over last year.  This is expected to increase the population health benefit from the vaccination campaign, as well as helping to reduce the pressure on the health service, particularly when combined with the uptake among children.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that 1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites since early October.  In addition, 420,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed.  </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be distributed and administered. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. </p>  <p>  Vaccinations are ordered well in advance &ndash; the HSE placed its order for the vaccine for those in at-risk groups in February. The HSE order for the 2020/21 season was 20% greater than the order for the 2019/20 season and about 35% more than 2019/20 uptake. These figures do not include the additional 600,000 doses of vaccine ordered for children aged from 2 &ndash; 12, which would bring to almost 75% the additional number of doses of vaccine available this year. Given the demand on the international market for influenza vaccine, it is not likely that we will be able to procure more vaccine at this point. </p>  <p>  When the vaccination programme is complete, we will have vaccinated more people in at-risk groups than ever before.  Current trends suggest that at least 350,000 more individuals in the at-risk groups will receive the flu vaccine this winter than last, including those over 65 and healthcare workers. In addition, over 100,000 children have already received the vaccination which is being provided without charge this year for the first time.  I expect this number to increase significantly in the coming weeks also.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department also has responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of North Harbour at Cape Clear, as well as the maintenance of a small number of specific piers, lights and beacons throughout Ireland, in accordance with the Marine Works (Ireland) Act 1902, and piers, lights and beacons constructed under the auspices of the Congested Districts Board. </p>  <p>  Greencastle Harbour is owned by Donegal County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development rests with that Local Authority in the first instance and its parent Department, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage thereafter. </p>  <p>  My Department co-funded works on phase one of a larger Greencastle Harbour Development project up to 2011, which involved the construction of a rock breakwater. </p>  <p>  &euro;8.37m was invested in this project between the years 2007 &ndash; 2010. Funding for capital projects was, of necessity, significantly reduced due to the economic conditions prevalent in 2010. Further funding of &euro;453,000 was provided for in my Department&rsquo;s 2011 capital programme to enable the Department to suspend the project in a safe and acceptable manner. In February 2012, my Department formally handed back responsibility for the Greencastle Harbour Development project to Donegal County Council, following completion of works to safeguard the partially constructed breakwater. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide funding to assist the 14 coastal Local Authorities, including Donegal County Council, in carrying out small scale projects for the development and repair of Local Authority owned piers, harbours and slipways under the annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, subject to available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.  Between the years 2010-2019, Donegal County Council has received funding of &euro; 3.6m under this programme, with &euro;739k of this allocated for works at Greencastle Harbour.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;3.1m has been approved for the Local Authority element of my Department&rsquo;s 2020 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme.  Donegal County Council has secured funding of &euro;433,500 under this programme, to undertake 7 Harbour Development and 4 Marine Leisure projects. Of this funding, &euro;90,000 has been allocated to repair works at Greencastle Harbour. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is currently undertaking Phase 2 of a major, multi-year capital investment project in Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre, County Donegal which will extend the landing pier at Smooth Point by 120 metres. The overall investment in this project is expected to be in excess of &euro;21m.</p>  <p>  I am currently examining all aspects of my Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, including planning for future programmes. </p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the importance of Greencastle Harbour to both the fishing industry in Donegal and nationally and plans for the completion of the Greencastle Breakwater Project is being considered by me in the context of this examination of the Department's Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme.</p></reply>

These Regulations were welcomed by the ISPCA and other welfare organisations, and put into law certain requirements for sellers and suppliers of pet animals, including minimum ages for sale of certain mammals; record-keeping; registration with the Department;  and provision of certain information about the pet in advertisements. </p>  <p>  Under the Regulations, anyone who sells or supplies six or more pet animals in a calendar year (this includes third-party sellers) must register with the Department, unless they are subject to the requirement to register with their local authority under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010. The Department is actively considering the issue of publication of the register, but must ensure that such is compliant with all data protection regulations.</p>  <p>  The Dog Breeding Establishments Act falls under the remit of the Minister for Rural and Community Development.  In relation to registered microchips, under the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015, four companies are authorised by my Department to register owner details of dog microchips, and there is no central database.  These companies provide details of the chips they hold to Europetnet which is a group of national and local associations throughout Europe that register owner information about pets that have been uniquely identified. Certain persons such as dog wardens and those who microchip dogs have access through this portal to the databases to enable the identification of microchipped dogs. </p>  <p>  There is further work to be done on effective enforcement of the Regulations and no infringement orders have been taken to date. However, the requirement to include certain information about a pet animal in an advertisement will assist potential pet owners in deciding the appropriate seller with whom to engage.  Potential pet owners should carefully conduct comprehensive research before acquiring a pet.  </p>  <p>  My Department participates in the Irish Pet Advertising Advisory Group (IPAAG), a group formed in 2015 by a number of animal welfare organisations, veterinary professionals and classified advertising websites to address irresponsible advertising of pets online.  Officials of my Department have engaged and will continue to engage constructively with members of IPAAG, on the issue of online advertising and enforcement of the new Regulations.  IPAAG has published practical, comprehensive advice on their website for anyone thinking of acquiring a pet, including what to check for in advertisements for pet animals.  The sale and purchase of a pet is a commercial transaction between a seller and a buyer.</p>  <p>  Any evidence of animal cruelty or neglect of an animal&rsquo;s welfare should be brought to the attention of my Department by calling the animal welfare helpline on 0761064408 (Call Save) or 01 6072379 or by emailing animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie.  All such reports are followed up on.  This Government is committed to advancing animal welfare.  In December 2019, my Department provided record funding awards of &euro;2,906,000 to 106 animal welfare organisations, in recognition of their good work.</p></reply>

In December 2019, the largest ever allocation of funding from my Department of &euro;2.906m to 106 animal welfare organisations was announced.  A number of other organisations undertake work with equines. I expect to make an announcement of funding for 2020 shortly. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for Government also contains commitments to provide additional urban horse welfare programmes. My Department continues to take a proactive approach in tackling challenges that arise in the case of horses by developing facilities for urban and traveller horse populations and in educating young people among these communities in the care and welfare of horses. This work is done in close collaboration with the local authorities involved.</p>  <p>  From 2015 to date, a total of &euro;1.36 million has been spent on urban horse projects. This amount is match funded by the relevant local authorities.</p>  <p>  There are currently seven live projects including the Clondalkin Project which has had the largest amount of capital investment (&euro;503k) and was set up to help this ongoing equine problem in the area, to make it affordable for the youth to keep horses locally and educate them on equine welfare.</p>  <p>  Other large successful projects include the Limerick Moyross Education &amp;amp; Therapy Program which is linked with six schools in Limerick. </p>  <p>  The Cherry Orchard Equine Project is a large scale project with a focus on community-led, equine centred, learning environment dedicated to the needs of young people through the provision of state recognised qualifications and recreational activities.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to support a number of urban horse projects nationwide, bringing education on all aspects of equine welfare to disadvantaged areas. As an example, in the context of breeding, the DSPCA with financial assistance from my Department, continues to facilitate castration clinics and education programs in an effort to address the problem of over-breeding which can add to welfare issues. </p>  <p>  In 2018 and 2019, my Department also funded an equine welfare course aimed at horse owners, in particular those who have involvement with trotting/harness type animals. Four of these courses were run including one in Garristown, Co. Dublin.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department also sit on the Dublin Region Horse Welfare Working Group with local authorities and relevant NGOs.  </p>  <p>  The Control of Horses Act, 1996 is currently under review within my Department and plans for replacement legislation are well advanced.  Under the Act, local authorities may take a range of actions in relation to equines including prohibiting horses in certain areas, the issuing of licences, the seizure of horses in contravention of the Act.  These powers can be used in respect of straying horses which includes horses put on land without the owner&rsquo;s permission, including public land.  The local authorities may also prosecute offenders under the Control of Horses Act.  While still at an unacceptable level, the overall numbers of equines seized have been falling year-on-year from a high of approximately 5,000 in 2014 to less than 900 in 2019. </p>  <p>  The completion on the new Animal Welfare Strategy is at an advanced stage and will be launched in the coming weeks. This will be Ireland&rsquo;s first, dedicated Animal Welfare Strategy and will be backed by the resources and expertise within my Department, with other Departments and Agencies, and with stakeholders and civil society.</p></reply>

My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines. Buyers are already permitted to view animals in marts before sale, socially distanced and by prior appointment with the relevant mart. There is no consideration being given at present to allowing buyers to  attend at the sales ring while the country remains at Level 5.  </p><p>Marts have been using online mart sales systems since April.  From a position where few marts had online systems in place in April, there has been a rapid take up of the new systems by marts over recent months.  Thousands of cattle and sheep have been bought and sold successfully using the various online platforms.  As with any new technology, there have been some glitches and these have been dealt with as they arise.</p><p>There are  some positive aspects of online sales at marts.  Online sales are reaching a much higher number of farmers, dealers, and agents than sales on marts premises did, even prior to the start of Covid restrictions.  The number of people logging in to online mart sales on a daily basis are many multiples of those that typically attend a mart sale in person. The majority of marts are reporting good clearance rates and robust prices.</p><p>From 9th to 15th November, cattle throughput in marts came to 31,220 head &ndash; this compares to 40,340 head in the corresponding week  in 2019, or 77.4% of the corresponding period in 2019. This demonstrates that marts have been able to continue to operate and farmers have been able to continue to buy and sell, thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of the marts and service providers involved.</p></reply>
