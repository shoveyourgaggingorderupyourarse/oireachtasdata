Following the appropriate procurement process, external consultants were appointed to the project in July 2018. </p>  <p>  As part of this project, Saolta University Healthcare Group undertook a planning project to assess the population health needs for the Hospital&rsquo;s catchment area in order to inform existing and future service needs to ensure the delivery of safe high quality acute, elective and cancer care for patients across the West/Northwest. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the HSE extended the scope of the appraisal to incorporate interim priority infrastructural requirements. While this prolonged the timeline for delivery of the report, it allowed for a review of the critical areas requiring infrastructure development, as well as a review of the requirements for the elective hospital. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the draft report on the options appraisal is undergoing final review at present, including a submission of the draft report to the Saolta Board for consideration. An initial briefing on the draft plan was provided by the HSE to my Department at the end of September.  The costs of the options appraisal process will be available once it is concluded.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the formal submission of this report which will allow for a detailed examination of the proposal to ensure it aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision and provides direction for the provision of health services in the West and Northwest into the future.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-10a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019101000048#WRA01100"><p>The Disability Act 2005 provides for an Assessment of Need for people with disabilities. Any child thought to have a disability, born on, or after June 1st, 2002 is eligible to apply for an 'Assessment of Need' that will detail his or her health needs arising from a disability.  Since its commencement in 2007, there have been significant year on year increases in the number of children applying both for an 'Assessment of Need' and for disability services generally. Regrettably, these increases have led to the extended waiting periods currently being experienced by children and their families.</p>  <p>  In order to improve the 'Assessment of Need' process and ensure that children receive an intervention as soon as possible, the HSE has developed a new Standard Operating Procedure for the Assessment of Need process. This measure will ensure children with disabilities and their families, access appropriate assessment and intervention as soon as possible, while at the same time bringing consistency to the Assessment of Need process in each Community Healthcare Organization of the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE  is currently concluding a lengthy consultation and Industrial Relations engagement regarding the implementation of this procedure which it hopes to have in place by the first quarter of 2020. In addition, HSE Disability Services is currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).</p>  <p>  The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  Evidence to date from areas where this has been rolled out shows that implementation of this programme will also have a positive impact on waiting lists both for Assessments of Need and therapy provision.</p>  <p>  Recently, an increase in therapy posts was identified as a priority requirement to meet current unmet need and projected future needs in children's disability services nationally. In that regard, last year's Budget provided for the recruitment of an additional 100 therapy posts to help reduce the long waiting times for assessment as well as supporting interventions for children who need them. The recruitment process for these posts is well underway and a number of posts have been filled. This welcome new resource will result in additional new therapy posts ranging from Speech and Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Social Workers and Psychologists.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that timely access to assessments and therapies is imperative in a child&rsquo;s development and I fully understand how delays in accessing the service are a source of great concern for both children and their families and while not addressing all needs, I am confident the initiatives I have outlined will have a significant positive impact in reducing waiting times for Assessment of Need over the course of the next year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-10a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019101000048#WRA01500"><p>Reducing waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures is a key commitment of government. While the last 18 months have seen considerable progress in the reduction of waiting times for Inpatient and Daycase treatments, I am conscious that the Outpatient Waiting List remains a significant challenge as demand for acute hospital services continues to grow. </p>  <p>  Waiting list figures for the end of September, due to be published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) later this week, show that there are 16,500 people waiting for an outpatient appointment at Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore. 61% of patients have been waiting less than one year, while 27% (4,500 patients) are currently waiting over 18 months. ENT accounts for 69% (3,080) of all patients waiting for an outpatient appointment over 18 months. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. In addition, my Department has established a Working Group comprised of representatives from the HSE, NTPF, and Departmental officials, to examine ways of improving access for patients waiting for scheduled care. Part of this work includes developing initiatives which will move care to the most appropriate setting, and at the lowest level of complexity. ENT is one of the specialties being examined as part of this process. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. The year-on-year increases to the National Treatment Purchase Fund since Budget 2017 reflect this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. In this regard, the HSE National Service Plan 2020 will set out a planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to reduce inpatient/day case waiting lists, with a particular focus on improving access to hospital outpatient services. In 2020, the Department will also be asking the HSE and NTPF to work together with the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Office with the aim of driving sustainable improvements to service provision.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-10a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019101000048#WRA01900"><p>Home supports enable older people to remain in their own homes and communities, as well as facilitating timely discharge from hospital.  At the end of August, the HSE had provided over 312,000 hours of home support in Clare and 1,191 people were receiving the service.  However, I acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like and there were 466 people waiting for new or additional service.  </p>  <p>  In line with commitments given in the Programme for Government we have made improved access to home support services a priority. In 2020 an additional investment of &euro;52 million is being made which will provide over 19.2 million hours of home support. This is 1 million hours more than the 2019 target and represents a substantial increase in service provision. </p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens. Included in this investment is dedicated funding for the testing of the new statutory home-support scheme in 2020. </p>  <p>  The design of the new scheme will involve the establishment of a model of service with a streamlined central system of administration to improve and simplify how people access home-support services. While the administration of the scheme will be centralised, the delivery of services will be co-ordinated at local level in line with a person&rsquo;s assessed need. A core component of the Scheme and the testing phase will be the implementation of InterRAI, as the standardised assessment tool for determining need under the new scheme. </p>  <p>  The testing phase will include a range of services with a focus on improving both cognitive and physical capacity and resilience to support people to live in their homes and in their communities. The core principles of Healthy Ireland, Positive Aging, prevention and early intervention will underpin this approach.</p></reply>

In the month of September 2019, there were 305 patients counted on trolleys in Sligo, which was a 1% increase compared to the previous month. </p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the distress overcrowded EDs cause to patients, their families and frontline staff working in very challenging working conditions in hospitals throughout the country. My Department is engaging extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.  </p>  <p>  Planning for winter 2019/20 has commenced and my Department is working with the HSE to finalise the Winter Plan in the coming weeks. Individual Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and Hospital Groups are preparing Integrated Winter Plans that will focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients as well as provide appropriate timely egress from acute hospitals. These Integrated Winter Plans will support the development of a single overarching strategic level Winter Plan for the HSE. </p>  <p>  The Integrated Winter Plan for Sligo University Hospital will be delivered by a Winter Action Team whose membership will include the CEO of the Saolta University Health Care Group, the Chief Officer of CHO 1, and the CEO of Sligo University Hospital. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive recently published its Capital Plan for 2019-2021 outlining projects to be progressed over the three-year period. The Capital Plan includes a new ward block development and additional bed capacity at Sligo University Hospital.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that preliminary design work and site investigations have been carried out for this new development at Sligo University Hospital. Planning approval was granted in July 2019 and the project is currently at the detailed design stage.</p></reply>

In line with national policy implemented under Transforming Lives, the focus in recent years has been to enable people with disabilities to live lives of their choosing. The provision of Personal Assistant hours is an essential component to facilitate this. </p>  <p>  The PA works on a one to one basis, in the home and the community, with a person with a physical or sensory disability. A vital element of this personalised support is the full involvement of the service user in planning and agreeing the type and the times when support is provided to them. Supporting independent living must enhance the person&rsquo;s control over their own life. </p>  <p>  PA Services are mainly provided through a range of voluntary service providers. The need for increased services is acknowledged and the HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need within the budget that is available. </p>  <p>  The HSE has consistently, year on year, increased the number of hours of PA Service delivered, resulting in the overall number of personal assistance hours increasing by 26% between 2013 and 2018, an increase in real terms of  340,000 hours. Over the same period the number of people receiving PA Services increased by approximately 480 to 2,535.</p>  <p>  The increase in PA support over the years reflects the increased provision of &lsquo;in-home&rsquo; respite using enhanced PA, in comparison with residential respite. </p>  <p>  The HSE's 2019 National Service Plan is committed to providing 1.63 million hours of personal assistance to people with disabilities, which represents an increase of 170,000 hours over the 2018 target. This year, PA Services have been delivered to over 2,550 people with a disability.  </p>  <p>  In the normal course of service delivery, an individual's requirements are constantly reviewed to ensure services meet changing need.  An individual&rsquo;s Personal Assistant hours may be adjusted following a service review where demand can result in one individual&rsquo;s hours being reduced in order to address priority needs of other people with disabilities within that community. </p>  <p>  This much needed flexibility gives local Community Healthcare Organisations the freedom to target Personal Assistant hours to maximum effect within their area.</p></reply>

The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the NHSS was approved by Government on the 11th June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The Department will progress this as quickly as possible, however, the timeline for completion of the legislation will also depend on how it passes through the Houses. The General Scheme has been sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department will participate in pre-legislative scrutiny when the Committee sets a date in the coming months. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period.</p></reply>

However, a number of on-campus programmes to promote health and wellbeing amongst students take place with the involvement of my Department and the HSE. These include initiatives around sexual health, mental health and awareness of the risks around tobacco, alcohol and substance misuse. </p>  <p>  In terms of sexual health, the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme collaborate with the Union of Students in Ireland on the Sexual Health Awareness and Guidance (SHAG) campaign every year. The campaign focusses on STI awareness and prevention, consent, contraception, unplanned pregnancy and promotion of the HSE MyOptions service. </p>  <p>  The National Condom Distribution Service functions as a central point for distributing free condoms and lubricant sachets to HSE services and other organisations working directly with individuals and groups who may be at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes, including young people. </p>  <p>  Further development and expansion of this initiative will be implemented across third level college and university access points in late 2019.</p>  <p>  Mental Health services for third level students are led by the Higher Education Authority. However, students can avail of all HSE mental health services during their time at third level institutions. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and HSE have been promoting the development of a number of digital mental health supports, apps such as +connections, telephone and text services, and pilots for on-line counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy services. The HSE also supports student mental health and wellbeing campaigns such as ReCharge, which was launched by Minister Daly in November of last year.</p>  <p>  The HSE Tobacco Free Ireland Programme was launched in 2013, with the aim of Ireland being tobacco free (use among less than 5% of the population) by 2025. One of the policies aimed at the de-normalisation of smoking is to promote tobacco free campuses for all third-level institutions in consultation with key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to engage with tobacco stakeholders through a Partners Group and has provided supports in terms of Tobacco Free Campus implementation from various third level institutions. The HSE has a website, askaboutalcohol.ie, which provides advice to young people with regard alcohol consumption.</p>  <p>  Reducing the harms caused to individuals, families and communities by substance misuse is a core goal of the National Drugs Strategy. 'Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  The HSE, in partnership with the Union of Students in Ireland earlier this year launched a harm-reduction information campaign, called #SaferStudentNights and has also run initiatives over the summer to counteract drug taking. These include harm reduction stands at three university events to discuss end of academic year celebrations and festivals and a campaign through drugs.ie aimed at university students and festival goers. </p>  <p>  A Healthy Ireland Healthy Campus initiative is currently being developed in consultation with the third level sector and is likely to be formally launched in the near future. The Healthy Campus initiative will provide a collaborative platform to deliver health and wellbeing initiatives across campuses in a consistent manner and provide a platform for sharing best practice on implementation.</p></reply>

These include national construction inflation in excess of 4%, any changes in scope, legislative changes and the Sectoral Employment Order.    </p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board manages the project, actively monitoring the performance of the contract. It also has a focus on identifying and managing risks, preventing further cost increases to the greatest extent possible. It has, for example, a robust process in place for the assessment of claims by the Contractor in accordance with the Construction Contract. All claims are independently assessed and determined by the Employers Representative. Where there is a dispute on the validity of a claim, the Construction Contract sets out the dispute management process.   </p>  <p>  In relation to timelines, there has been references to construction delays on the project. As the Chair of National Paediatric Hospital Development Board advised the Joint Committee on Health in June, some delays have arisen to date. However opportunities to mitigate these delays will be taken throughout the remainder of the project.   </p>  <p>  The main Construction Contractor is currently reporting the project to be behind on certain elements of the construction, however, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has sought a revised programme timeline from the contractor setting out mitigation measures to bring construction back on line.</p>  <p>  Substantial progress has already been made with the construction of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and associated enabling works. The structural frame on the construction site is now reaching roof level in most advanced areas of the building, resulting in the building now being visible well above the hoarding.  Basement excavation, with the exception of the temporary road, is now complete and piling is also complete. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the main hospital will be completed by late 2022 and following a period of commissioning, open to patients in 2023.</p></reply>

The objective of audit and quality review at CervicalCheck was to facilitate continued improvement and ongoing learning within the programme. Following the issues which arose in relation to the non-disclosure of audit findings, a decision was taken to pause the audit. </p>  <p>  The Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Gabriel Scally made a number of recommendations, one of which was that &ldquo;Audit should continue to be an important component of cervical screening as this complies with all good clinical practice. Common, robust and externally validated approaches to the design, conduct, evaluation and oversight of audits should be developed across the screening services.&rdquo; (Recommendation 26).</p>  <p>  This recommendation was accepted by Government, as were all of Dr Scally's recommendations and actions to implement these were set out in an implementation plan approved by Government and published on the website of my Department. As set out in the implementation plan, the HSE has established an Expert Group within the National Screening Service to review the clinical audit processes for interval cancers across all screening programmes. The Expert Group, which includes two patient representatives, will develop a report setting out recommendations for the operation of clinical audit processes across all screening programmes. The Expert Group is expected to complete its work at the end of this year, following which its recommendations will be implemented by the HSE. I expect that the detail requested by the Deputy regarding the timing of the recommencement of the audit, and how it will operate, will be informed by the Expert Group's work and this detail will become available once that work is complete.</p></reply>

In the month of September 2019, there were 897 patients counted on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, which was a 28% increase compared to the previous month.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that this is unacceptably high and the HSE are actively working with the University of Limerick Hospital Group to ease congestion in University Hospital Limerick with a focus on facilitating transfers to Level 2 hospitals, assistance from rehabilitation units and Community Health Organisation services, and prioritisation of diagnostics to aid inpatient discharges.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions across the health service to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.  </p>  <p>  Planning for winter 2019/20 has commenced and my Department is working with the HSE to finalise the Winter Plan in the coming weeks. Individual Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and Hospital Groups are preparing Integrated Winter Plans that will focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients as well as provide appropriate timely egress from acute hospitals. The Integrated Winter Plans will support the development of a single overarching strategic level Winter Plan for the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Integrated Winter Plan for University Hospital Limerick will be delivered by a Winter Action Team whose membership will include the CEO of UL Hospital Group and the Chief Officer of CHO Midwest. </p>  <p>  I understand that intensive work is underway between the UL Hospital Group and CHO Midwest in the context of recent Emergency Department pressures. Delayed Transfers of Care have decreased from a peak of 30 in the last week of August 2019 to 20 in the first week of October 2019.  This joint working will continue throughout the winter period and beyond. </p>  <p>  The winter plan and associated initiatives will be supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding available nationally, which I have agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as part of this week's Budget. This funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme and the availability of home care, transitional care, aids and appliances and other local actions to both facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period. </p>  <p>  These initiatives build upon the progress that has been made on increasing capacity in University Hospital Limerick. Since December 2017, an additional 25 beds have opened in University Hospital Limerick, including 8 which opened at the start of this year as part of the 2018/2019 Winter Plan. </p>  <p>  A capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at University Hospital Limerick, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019. The HSE have advised that the enabling works are complete, and the main contractor is now commencing work. This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the National Development Plan includes a 96-bed replacement ward block in University Hospital Limerick and capital funding was provided in 2018 to progress the design phase of the project. A design team has been appointed for this project.</p></reply>

There is currently increasing levels of &ldquo;changing needs&rdquo; due to the increase in the age of the disability population. The need for increased respite facilities is acknowledged and the HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.</p>  <p>  As part of a &euro;10m investment in Respite Services from the HSE National Service Plan 2019, South East Community Healthcare has delivered additional respite supports, including respite at a new adult house in Wexford; referrals for this service are accepted from all across the South East including Carlow/Kilkenny.  While some agencies in the South East are currently experiencing staffing challenges to meet the respite needs of clients that have funded respite, I am informed that the respite house in Wexford accepted Out of County referrals of 154 bed nights from 1st   January 2019 to 27th June 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Respite House in Tullow,  Co.

This is a reduction of 6.5% (4,700) compared to September 2018, while the numbers waiting over 9 months have fallen by 16% (3,100), and the number waiting over 18 months have fallen by 19% compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  The Outpatient waiting list remains a challenge, with figures for the end of September 2019 standing at almost at 569,000 an increase of over 53,000 (10%) in the last year. The GI Endoscopy waiting list shows 22,197 patients waiting, which is an increase of 4,669 (27%) since last September. </p>  <p>  These figures highlight that scheduled care activity has, for much of the year, been running behind the levels set out in the Access Plan. Performance reflects the impact of the broader challenges being experienced across the health service this year, which include:</p>  <p>-   The impact of the industrial action &ndash; the HSE advise that the strike action in January/February and June resulted in the cancellation of over 54,000 appointments across IPDC, OPD and GI scope procedures;</p>  <p>  - Increased Emergency workload coupled with increased Delayed Discharges has reduced the HSE capacity to accommodate less urgent elective cases; and</p>  <p>  - Increased referrals to the Endoscopy Programme as well as the increased demands on the service arising from the National Screening programmes.</p>  <p>  As the numbers waiting are behind the activity targets set out in the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019, I have directed the HSE to develop plans to recover as much lost activity as possible before the end of this year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. The year-on-year increases to the National Treatment Purchase Fund since Budget 2017 reflects this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. In this regard, the HSE National Service Plan 2020 will set out a planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to reduce inpatient/day case waiting times, and with a particular focus on improving access to hospital outpatient services. </p>  <p>  In 2020, the  NTPF will further expand its list of targeted inpatient and daycase procedures to support further significant reductions in wait times as well as increasing funding towards supporting full packages of care for patients on the outpatient waiting lists, to include surgery or treatment where required.</p></reply>

The HSE currently funds day services for over 27,000 people with disabilities, including day services and Rehabilitative Training Programmes.</p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s New Directions policy seeks to reconfigure and personalise HSE funded adult day services and offers a flexible and individualised set of supports to enable each person to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes and needs.</p><p>Rehabilitative Training Programmes are designed to equip participants with basic personal, social and work-related skills. Approximately 2,200 people attend Rehabilitative Training programmes, including the approximately 400 new school leavers who have commenced their Rehabilitative Training programme since September this year.</p><p>The Rehabilitative Training Bonus payment is currently payable at a rate of &euro;31.80 per week. It was introduced in 2001, aligned with a similar F&Aacute;S Training Bonus that later became the Solas Vocational Training Programme payment. It is important to note that this payment was reduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2012, while to date the Rehabilitative Training Bonus has continued to be paid in the Health Sector.</p><p>Since September 2019, the Rehabilitative Training Bonus payment no longer applies to new attendees. Rather, the money that would have been spent on the bonus, estimated at approximately &euro;3.7 million over four years, will be redirected to address unmet need in day service provision for people with disabilities.</p><p>This redirected funding, which the HSE has confirmed will be ring-fenced, will create approximately 148 additional full day placements or 370 additional enhanced day places nationally.  Access will be targeted to those with a reduced service or no service arising from there being minimal or no investment in day services during the recession and will be based on priority need.</p><p>Each Community Healthcare Organisation will have the flexibility to redirect its own savings to address local service requirements, and the HSE has confirmed it will be reporting regularly to the Department of Health on the additional placements realised.</p><p>I wish to emphasise that current participants in Rehabilitative Training Programmes will not be affected, and their payments will continue until they complete their 4-year programme.</p><p>The reason for this action is therefore to bring equity and consistency between people with a disability attending HSE funded rehabilitative training programmes who receive the payment, and those attending similar HSE funded Day Services or in other State schemes such as further education and training, who do not.</p></reply>

In the month of September 2019, there were 897 patients counted on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, which was a 28% increase compared to the previous month.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that this is unacceptably high and the HSE are actively working with the University of Limerick Hospital Group to ease congestion in University Hospital Limerick with a focus on facilitating transfers to Level 2 hospitals, assistance from rehabilitation units and Community Health Organisation services, and prioritisation of diagnostics to aid inpatient discharges.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions across the health service to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.  </p>  <p>  Planning for winter 2019/20 has commenced and my Department is working with the HSE to finalise the Winter Plan in the coming weeks. Individual Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and Hospital Groups are preparing Integrated Winter Plans that will focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients as well as provide appropriate timely egress from acute hospitals. These Integrated Winter Plans will support the development of a single overarching strategic level Winter Plan for the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Integrated Winter Plan for University Hospital Limerick will be delivered by a Winter Action Team whose membership will include the CEO of UL Hospital Group and the Chief Officer of CHO Midwest. </p>  <p>  I understand that intensive work is underway between the UL Hospital Group and CHO Midwest in the context of recent Emergency Department pressures. Delayed Transfers of Care have decreased from a peak of 30 in the last week of August 2019 to 20 in the first week of October 2019.  This joint working will continue throughout the winter period and beyond. </p>  <p>  The winter plan and associated initiatives will be supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding available nationally, which I have agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as part of this week's Budget. This funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme and the availability of home care, transitional care, aids and appliances and other local actions to both facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period. </p>  <p>  These initiatives build upon the progress that has been made on increasing capacity in University Hospital Limerick. Since December 2017, an additional 25 beds have opened in University Hospital Limerick, including 8 which opened at the start of this year as part of the 2018/2019 Winter Plan. </p>  <p>  A capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at University Hospital Limerick, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019. The HSE have advised that the enabling works are complete, and the main contractor is now commencing work. This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the National Development Plan includes a 96-bed replacement ward block in University Hospital Limerick and capital funding was provided in 2018 to progress the design phase of the project. A design team has been appointed for this project.</p></reply>

The Committee&rsquo;s role will be to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly.  </p>  <p>   I appointed Professor Niall O&rsquo;Higgins as Chair of the Committee in July 2019 and asked that, as part of its initial body of work, the Committee prioritise a review of the national newborn blood-spot screening programme and look specifically at how Ireland should best proceed with an expansion in line with international best practice.  </p>  <p>   Ireland, very much like the UK has always evaluated the case for commencing a national screening programme against international accepted criteria &ndash; collectively known as the Wilson Junger criteria.

The aim of the Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. 13 Steering Group meetings have taken place with a further two meetings scheduled to take place this year. A large volume of its work has been completed.  </p>  <p>  To date the National Review has completed a public consultation survey, collated and analysed information on activity levels in each of the Hospital Groups and all hospitals within each Group. A successful and well attended stakeholder consultation was held in November 2018. The Health Research Board - Collaboration in Ireland for Clinical Effectiveness Reviews (HRB-CICER) has completed an Evidence Review of Specialist Cardiac Services looking at (i) international standards for PCI centres (ii) international models that might be applicable to the Irish Healthcare system and (iii) the relationship between volume and patient outcomes for PCI. The Evidence Review has provided important guidance for the Steering Group thus far and arising from discussions at the Steering Group they have been asked to complete one additional evidence review question.  Site visits to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) centres commenced earlier this year and will be complete this month. These site visits have included meetings with stakeholders in clinical, administrative, nursing and allied health professional roles. In addition two international site visits are being planned to review and benchmark against established cardiology networks. </p>  <p>  An additional workstream is being undertaken by the Health Intelligence Unit of the HSE with regards to Geospatial analysis and mapping of networks of cardiac services from a national perspective.</p>  <p>  The Chair is targeting that the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services will be completed before the end of the year and I would expect to be informed of any change to that timeline.</p></reply>

The HSE Management Data Report (MDR) reports on HSE activity against Key Performance Indicators as set out in the National Service Plan for 2019. Under the National Service Plan 2019, the target for all hospital groups, including Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI), is for 80% of people to wait less than 52 weeks for a first Outpatient Department appointment.  </p><p>The last published MDR figures are for June 2019 and report that 60% of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment at CHI hospitals are waiting 52 weeks or less. Furthermore, the NSP target for Outpatient Activity (including both new and return appointments) for CHI for 2019 is 145,766 appointments for the full year. The target to the end of June was 73,274 while actual activity to the end of June was recorded in the MDR as 55,528. In addition, the target for new:return appointments for CHI for 2019 is 1:2.3. As of the end of June, CHI reported a ratio of 1:2.4.</p><p>CHI has advised that it is committed to reducing waiting lists and supporting initiatives that ensure that children receive care appropriately and in a timely manner, and in 2019 a number of initiatives were put in place to address Outpatient Waiting Lists.</p><p>For example, the new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre in CHI at Connolly opened on 31<sup>st</sup>July 2019. This new facility offers a range of services to children and their families in the local area as well as those in Dublin North city and county and the surrounding areas in Kildare and Meath. General Paediatric Clinics are held from 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday. CHI has advised that the opening of CHI at Connolly is having a positive impact on CHI OPD waiting lists. At the end of September 2019, there were 4,130 patients on CHI&rsquo;s General Paediatric Outpatient waiting list, which is a 35% reduction when compared to the same period last year. </p><p>Furthermore, CHI at Connolly will provide a further 1,300 outpatient appointments between September and December 2019. CHI advise that they are currently in the process of expanding these clinics to provide a focus on the specific requirements for some patients including asthma, allergy, faltering growth and constipation. When fully operational, CHI at Connolly is expected to provide 17,000 outpatient appointments (General Paediatrics and Orthopaedic clinics) every year  <b>. </b></p><p>Management of referrals is a key enabler to reducing waiting lists, and in this regard CHI advise that they have initiated a referrals process whereby all referrals from the three children&rsquo;s hospitals are managed centrally. The group is progressing its ICT requirements to have a single Patient Administration System across all CHI sites (the three children&rsquo;s hospitals and CHI at Connolly). </p><p>The central referrals team, through administrative and clinical validation are ensuring that all appointment slots are used appropriately and that where appropriate, patients are removed from the waiting list, which is assisting in the waiting list reduction.</p><p>Another example of innovation in referral pathways is the TORC project (Triage of Referral Clinics). This is one of a number of virtual clinics currently being held across CHI and involves the active triage of referrals, the provision of advice and commencement of treatment for patients. As a result, patients may then either not have to attend an outpatient clinic appointment or can begin their pathway of care prior to attendance. CHI advise that this has been very successful in achieving a discharge rate of up to 30% of patients contacted. In addition, patients can begin their diagnostics prior to attending an appointment which ensures the best use of resources and reduction in follow-up attendances for patients and their families. </p><p>CHI is continuing with a number of other initiatives including moving Dermatology referrals towards a more centralised structure together with a virtual clinic model in this specialty. </p><p>CHI continues to engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to secure funding for initiatives in 2019 to address access to patients for specialties including ENT, Ophthalmology, General Paediatrics, Orthopaedics and Gastroenterology. </p><p>CHI advises that recruitment of additional consultants for CHI specialties with the longest OPD waiting times (Allergy, Dermatology, Radiology, Gastroenterology, Rheumatology, Orthopaedics &amp;amp; ENT) is also underway following CHI securing additional National Service Plan funding in 2019. In appointing these positions, the multidisciplinary teams are also reviewing their current work practices and identifying new ways of working to ensure appropriate management of waiting lists.</p></reply>

The Health budget increased by &euro;1.2 billion on 2019, a substantial additional level of funding. The amount allocated follows an extensive process of engagement between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which considered both the funding requirements and the fiscal position. These types of engagements are a normal part of the Budgetary process and happen with Departments across Government. All Departments put forward spending proposals but are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il.  </p>  <p>  The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge for both the Irish and international Governments.  Despite welcome increases annually, the need for effective financial management remains crucial as the health service deals with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs associated with these service pressures will increasingly need to be managed not solely through annual increased Exchequer allocations but also through improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base. </p>  <p>  Both the additional funding allocated and additional value to be derived from improved efficiencies and productivity will be considered by the HSE in setting out its National Service Plan (NSP) 2020.  Under legislation the HSE is required to set out the type and volume of health and social care services to be provided having regard to the funding available and I am confident that the NSP  will clearly demonstrate this.</p></reply>

The Committee&rsquo;s role will be to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly.  </p>  <p>   I appointed Professor Niall O&rsquo;Higgins as Chair of the Committee in July 2019 and asked that, as part of its initial body of work, the Committee prioritise a review of the national newborn blood-spot screening programme and look specifically at how Ireland should best proceed with an expansion in line with international best practice.  </p>  <p>   Ireland, very much like the UK has always evaluated the case for commencing a national screening programme against international accepted criteria &ndash; collectively known as the Wilson Junger criteria. The evidence bar for commencing a screening programme should and must remain high.  This ensures that we can be confident that the programme is effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards.</p>  <p>   It is correct that the number of conditions screened for by Member States (MS) in Europe does vary. This does not reflect major differences in the genetic background of populations or estimated prevalences but rather highlights different MS approaches to (1) the estimation of risks and benefits in their populations and (2) responding to the cultural demands and ethical difficulties arising from a lack of evidence to screen for many of these rare conditions. Detailed knowledge about the natural course of many rare diseases, their variants and specifically information on the medium and long term outcomes after early treatment initiation are still insufficient.</p>  <p>   There is no doubt that newborn screening programmes have the potential to be rapidly transformed by new technologies and new therapies but this highlights the need to continue with a robust, methodologically sound and detailed analysis of the evidence in each and every case against the Wilson and Junger criteria. </p>  <p>   Any future potential changes to the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Programme will be incorporated as part of the Committee&rsquo;s work programme.</p></reply>

In the month of September 2019, there were 789 patients counted on trolleys in Cork University Hospital, which was a 15.3% decrease compared to the previous month.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions across the health service to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.</p>  <p>  Planning for winter 2019/20 has commenced and my Department is working with the HSE to finalise the Winter Plan in the coming weeks. Individual Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and Hospital Groups are preparing Integrated Winter Plans that will focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients as well as provide appropriate timely egress from acute hospitals. These Integrated Winter Plans will support the development of a single overarching strategic level Winter Plan for the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Integrated Winter Plans for Cork University Hospital will be delivered by a Winter Action Team whose membership will include the CEO of South South West Hospital Group and the Chief Officer of Cork Kerry Community Healthcare. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review published last year highlighted the need for a major investment in additional capacity. An additional 40 beds have opened in Cork University Hospital since 2018, including 8 that opened in January as part of the Winter Plan 2018/2019.</p></reply>

The Department, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), with the full support of stakeholders, are implementing a comprehensive and coordinated set of preparations to ensure continuity of treatment and care for patients in Ireland in the event of a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit.</p>  <p>  I refer Deputy Durkan to Chapter 24 of the Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan for Brexit, updated in July 2019, which specifically details work underway in this area. </p>  <p>  Ireland is unlikely to face general medicine shortages in the period immediately after 31 October. Any emerging supply issues will, in the first instance, be dealt with from existing supplies held within the domestic distribution chain, which has already has additional stocks of medicines routinely built into it. This is different to the wholesaling model which operates in the UK. The pharmaceutical industry and wholesalers have provided assurances that they are confident that they will have sufficient stocks to bridge any initial issues at ports, should they occur.</p>  <p>  As a result there is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions, as doing so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients. Patients should continue to fill their prescriptions and take their medications as they normally would.</p>  <p>  My department, the HSE and the HPRA have facilitated ongoing engagements with manufacturers and suppliers of medicines and medical devices, to ensure that they are Brexit-ready, to discuss any potential issues that could affect supply to Ireland and to identify solutions to maintain supply to the market.</p>  <p>  As a result of these measures undertaken at industry, national and EU level, Brexit is not expected to have an immediate impact on the supply of medicines in Ireland. However, given the size of our market, Brexit may cause those with a small share of a particular medicine market to consider the ongoing viability of supply to Ireland. However, it is considered that any such products are unlikely to be critical to continuity of care, as there are and will be alternative suppliers or therapeutic alternatives available. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, medicine shortages are a feature of modern health systems, but Ireland has a multi-stakeholder system in place to prevent and manage shortages when they occur. Any shortages currently affecting the Irish market are not directly attributable to Brexit. </p>  <p>  The HPRA has worked with stakeholders, including the HSE, to develop an effective approach to the management of medicine shortages in Ireland. In 2018 the HPRA launched the &ldquo;Medicine Shortages Framework&rdquo;, which is built in a pragmatic and collaborative approach involving the wide range of stakeholders within the medicine supply chain. The HPRA coordinates all stakeholders to share information in order to prevent or mitigate the impact of medicine shortages when they occur. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit.</p>  <p>  As an additional safeguard, consideration continues to be given to those categories of medicines which are considered most essential to public health. The HSE and HPRA are continuing to undertake criticality assessments, seeking additional and updated assurances from stakeholders, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers and healthcare professionals, to verify contingency planning to date and, where necessary, identify clinically appropriate alternatives for those products most critical to public health with potential to be vulnerable to supply issues. </p>  <p>  Manufacturers and suppliers of medicines have been asked to further review their supply chain for products that travel from or through the UK, determine any products or services that are certified for compliance with EU standards by a UK body and communicate any potential vulnerabilities to the Department of Health, HPRA or HSE. No major issues have been identified through this process.  </p>  <p>  While there can be no absolute guarantees following a no deal Brexit, significant work has been undertaken to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and risks to provide this high level of assurance around continuity of care and treatment for patients in Ireland. Work on this will continue up to, and in the months following, Brexit. This will include ongoing monitoring of supplies in Ireland and engagement with industry to adapt supply chains, where necessary, to minimise any potential disruption.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.   </p>  <p>  Waiting list figures for the end of September, due to be published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) later this week, show that there are 32,955 people waiting for an outpatient appointment at Tallaght Hospital.  Of those waiting, 37% receive their appointment in 6 months or less and 57% are waiting 12 months or less. Urology, ENT, dermatology and gynaecology account for over 67% of the patients waiting over 12 months for an outpatient appointment at Tallaght Hospital.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. In addition, my Department has established a Working Group comprised of representatives from the HSE, NTPF, and Departmental officials, to examine ways of improving access for patients waiting for scheduled care. Part of this work includes developing initiatives which will move care to the most appropriate setting, and at the lowest level of complexity. Urology, ENT, dermatology, and gynaecology are some of the specialties being examined as part of this process. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. The year-on-year increases to the National Treatment Purchase Fund since Budget 2017 reflect this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. </p>  <p>   My Department is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. In this regard, the HSE National Service Plan 2020 will set out a planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to reduce inpatient/day case waiting lists, with a particular focus on improving access to hospital outpatient services. In 2020, the Department will also be asking the HSE and NTPF to work together with the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Office with the aim of driving sustainable improvements to service provision.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

There are many reasons for this such as a patient undertaking the application process for NHSS, awaiting assessment for a home support package, resolving legal complexity (e.g. ward of court), or awaiting the availability of rehabilitation or other resources.</p>  <p>  When possible, the HSE will use transitional care to accommodate the patient during the period between discharge and the finalisation of new care arrangements, but there can often be a delay, especially in cases where the patient and family are coming to terms with the new circumstances.</p>  <p>  As of 1 October 2019, the HSE reported 141 patients nationally who are waiting to be discharged with home support. Of those, 8 have been referred to community services for assessment of their needs, and 42 have applications for home care submitted and being processed.</p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply, and we have seen an increase the number of delayed transfers of care (DTOCs). While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support. In response, and in the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current the high-level of DTOCs. However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS in September, and provided additional home care and transitional care beds.</p></reply>

In the month of September 2019, there were 897 patients counted on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, which was a 28% increase compared to the previous month.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that this is unacceptably high and the HSE are actively working with the University of Limerick Hospital Group to ease congestion in University Hospital Limerick with a focus on facilitating transfers to Level 2 hospitals, assistance from rehabilitation units and Community Health Organisation services, and prioritisation of diagnostics to aid inpatient discharges.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions across the health service to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.  </p>  <p>  Planning for winter 2019/20 has commenced and my Department is working with the HSE to finalise the Winter Plan in the coming weeks. Individual Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and Hospital Groups are preparing Integrated Winter Plans that will focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients as well as provide appropriate timely egress from acute hospitals. These Integrated Winter Plans will support the development of a single overarching strategic level Winter Plan for the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Integrated Winter Plan for University Hospital Limerick will be delivered by a Winter Action Team whose membership will include the CEO of UL Hospital Group and the Chief Officer of CHO Midwest. </p>  <p>  I understand that intensive work is underway between the UL Hospital Group and CHO Midwest in the context of recent Emergency Department pressures. Delayed Transfers of Care have decreased from a peak of 30 in the last week of August 2019 to 20 in the first week of October 2019.  This joint working will continue throughout the winter period and beyond. </p>  <p>  The winter plan and associated initiatives will be supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding available nationally, which I have agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as part of this week's Budget. This funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme and the availability of home care, transitional care, aids and appliances and other local actions to both facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period. </p>  <p>  These initiatives build upon the progress that has been made on increasing capacity in University Hospital Limerick. Since December 2017, an additional 25 beds have opened in University Hospital Limerick, including 8 which opened at the start of this year as part of the 2018/2019 Winter Plan. </p>  <p>  A capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at University Hospital Limerick, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019. The HSE have advised that the enabling works are complete, and the main contractor is now commencing work. This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the National Development Plan includes a 96-bed replacement ward block in University Hospital Limerick and capital funding was provided in 2018 to progress the design phase of the project. A design team has been appointed for this project.</p></reply>

Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. Under the plan there has been a continued effort to improve patient access for certain high-volume procedures, including cataracts. The NTPF procures capacity for each of the procedures identified in the Action Plan, including cataract procedures, in both private hospitals or public hospitals. The Action Plan also strikes the appropriate balance between maximising the number of patients treated in both public and private capacity, as appropriate, and ensuring the best return for the taxpayer. </p>  <p>  Under the Inpatient Day Case Access Plans for 2018 and 2019, cataracts were one of the specialties targeted by the NTPF, and by end of September 2019, the number of people waiting nationally for a cataract procedure had almost halved, from 10,024 in July 2017 to 5,074. In this same period, there has also been a reduction of 88% in the number of patients waiting over 9 months for a cataract operation. </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of patients awaiting cataract surgery in Cork and Kerry, data provided by South South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) at the beginning of September, shows that of 499 patients waiting, 349 (70%) were waiting less than 6 months.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the SSWHG has advised that the NTPF has approved funding for 401 patients to receive cataract surgery with an external provider in 2019. </p>  <p>  As part of the IPDC Action Plan 2018, a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre was opened by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital, in November 2018. This initiative continues to have a positive impact in reducing waiting times for patients waiting for cataract procedures, especially in the mid-west. Given the central location of Nenagh Hospital it is envisaged that, in time, it has the potential to provide capacity for cataract surgery for patients on waiting lists in public hospitals in the surrounding geographical areas. The HSE has advised that University Limerick Hospital Group is working collaboratively with the South South West Hospital Group to review over 1,000 patients on Ophthalmology waiting lists that may be suitable for cataract procedures in Nenagh.</p>  <p>  In addition, in line with the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare, I have asked the HSE and NTPF to work together this year with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. A Working Group comprised of representatives from the HSE, NTPF, and Departmental officials, has been established to examine ways of improving access for patients waiting for scheduled care. Part of this work included examining initiatives which would move care to the most appropriate setting, and at the lowest level of complexity, such as providing ophthalmology in the community.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. The year-on-year increases to the NTPF since Budget 2017 reflects this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. In this regard, the HSE National Service Plan 2020 will set out a planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to reduce inpatient/day case waiting times, and with a particular focus on improving access to hospital outpatient services. </p>  <p>  In 2020, the NTPF will further expand its list of targeted inpatient and daycase procedures to support further significant reductions in wait times as well as increasing funding towards supporting full packages of care for patients on the outpatient waiting lists, to include surgery or treatment where required.   </p></reply>

These facilities will provide high volume, low complexity procedures on a day and outpatient basis, together with a range of ambulatory diagnostic services. The high volume of demand for such services in these major urban centres is sufficient to justify the construction of dedicated ambulatory centres. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that these facilities will be sited adjacent to acute hospitals. The aim is to both increase capacity in the hospital system and provide a better separation of scheduled and unscheduled care, in line with the recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. They will provide increased, protected capacity for elective treatment and free up capacity in major hospitals to address higher complexity and emergency care. </p></reply>

To qualify for tax relief under that section, any travelling expenses must be necessarily incurred, and any other employment-related expenses must be wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred, in the performance of the duties of the relevant employment and must not be reimbursed by the employer. The FRE regime eases the administrative burden on Revenue and on employees in certain sectors by facilitating the automatic granting of a fixed tax allowance to cover allowable employment-related expenses, without the need for annual claims by every employee concerned.  It is important to note, however, that the regime does not preclude any employee from making an individual claim for a tax allowance in respect of employment-related expenses, where those expenses meet the statutory requirement for such an allowance.    Therefore, while certain employees may no longer claim a deduction on a universal &ldquo;flat rate&rdquo; basis, they may still be able to still claim a deduction on a specific &ldquo;vouched basis&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  I am aware that over the past 18 months, Revenue has been conducting a comprehensive review of the FRE regime.  Revenue has advised me that the purpose of the FRE review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  Each category of FRE allowance is being examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements.  The review will result in increases and decreases in several FRE categories and the withdrawal of the right to avail of an FRE allowance in some categories.  An FRE allowance can only be retained to the extent that there is a legislative basis to support the right to tax deductibility in respect of the expense.</p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that its review is now nearing conclusion. As previously advised, the implementation date for all changes to the FRE regime will be 1 January 2020 to make sure that employees in any one sector are not impacted on earlier than employees of another sector.  Revenue will be publishing a comprehensive list of all FRE allowances for 2020 in advance of the implementation date.  It is not appropriate, in advance of the finalisation of the review and the publication of the list, to indicate the employment categories which will be subject to increases or decreases in the FRE allowance amount or which no longer meet the legislative basis for deductibility. </p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that it is not possible to accurately quantify the anticipated increase in tax revenue arising out of any abolition or reduction of FRE allowances, as the cost of such allowances vary depending on the particular circumstances of the individual recipients, for example, the extent of their income subject to tax and whether income is subject to tax at the standard or marginal rate. Moreover, a breakdown of the cost and numbers by reference to each employment category in which the FRE regime currently operates is not readily available. </p>  <p>  Finally, on the question of whether I have discussed the FRE review with Revenue, I can confirm that I am aware of Revenue&rsquo;s programme of work in this area and I understand that the purpose of the review is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  As the Deputy will be aware, the administration of the tax code is exclusively a matter for Revenue who are independent in the performance of their functions.  Any changes in practice to the flat rate expenses regime are therefore a matter for Revenue, but I understand that any withdrawal of the practice can only take place if Revenue are satisfied that there is no longer a legally valid basis to give the concession, after engagement with the relevant representative body acting on behalf of the various categories of workers.</p>  <p>  Having said this, I expect that Revenue as they have demonstrated on many occasions will implement the outcome of their review in their customary proportionate and fair manner fully cognisant of the impact on the individuals concerned.</p></reply>

Compliant taxpayers who complete a HTB application are provided with an application number and a summary of the maximum relief available to them under the incentive. A mortgage provider, broker, qualifying contractor or solicitor can use this summary to verify the relief available to the applicant, for the purposes of mortgage approval or drawdown, or signing a house purchase contract. Revenue advise me that, to end September 2019 (the most recent month for which data are available), they have received 32,885 HTB applications.</p><p>An application will progress to the claim stage where the applicant decides to purchase a property that is eligible for the scheme. Many applications may never progress to the claim stage because the applicant does not purchase a property or purchases a property not eligible for the scheme. Revenue advise me that, to end September 2019, some 15,357 HTB claims have been made.</p><p>Claims made cannot be approved and paid until the qualifying contractor, or the solicitor acting on behalf of self-builder, has verified the claim.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-10a.286.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019101000052#WRE02800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</p><p>I am aware of the issues facing many businesses in the leisure sector when it comes to the affordability and availability of insurance. Unfortunately, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to the leisure sector as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Consequently, the Government cannot direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as those in the leisure sector.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, I cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, I wish to re-emphasise however that this issue remains a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and has produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report</i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report</i>.  The latter report in particular makes it clear the impact that the cost of insurance is having on the leisure and other sectors and this position has been reinforced by Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s continuing engagement with the sector. Therefore, there is a clear understanding of the impact of this problem on the leisure sector and there is a recognition that the single most essential challenge which must be addressed if we are to overcome it is a sustainable reduction in insurance costs. </p><p>In this regard, the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced. This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales. The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the Judicial Council Act.  This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly.</p><p>Other steps take to date to address the spiralling cost of insurance include the following: </p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;</p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 </i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;</p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p><p>- The reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance; </p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality, and;</p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;</p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to businesses.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced as a result of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, then the insurance premium and coverage issues that are being experienced by the leisure, sports and tourism sectors and many businesses more generally should recede.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The Deputy will note however that the selection process procedures and enrolment policy are the responsibility of the individual school authorities.</p><p>Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parent&rsquo;s choice are respected.</p><p>Under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 where a board of management make a decision to refuse enrolment, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where the appeal involves an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, the appeal must be made to the local ETB in the first instance. Further information on the Section 29 Appeals process is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>In addition, the Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718815.</p><p>My Department currently has no application under the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA) for the Newbridge area.  I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects, including those in County Kildare, being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly.

Circumstances may arise where it is necessary to limit the number of students who can avail of the Transition Year programme in a school and it is the board of management of these schools that decide the number of places available on the programme. In cases where restrictions apply, schools should have clear procedures regarding how places are allocated to students.  </p><p>In 2018/19, 45,915 students in 670 schools participated in Transition Year. This means over two thirds of all students, as a percentage of the previous third years, participated in Transition Year in approximately 92.8% of schools.</p><p>Of the 28 post primary schools in Kildare that registered returns to the Department of Education and Skills, 27 offered Transition Year in the 2018/19 school year.</p><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently carrying out a review of Senior Cycle.

The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant;</p><p>2. Total reckonable income, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;24,000;</p><p>3. As at 31st of December 2018, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in the Student Grant Scheme.</p><p>The Report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education made detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.</p><p>The target group of &quot;those most in need&quot; was defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled. Hence, the income threshold for the special rate of grant is aligned with the highest rate of social welfare support for the Old Age (Contributory) Pension. For the 2019/20 scheme, the threshold was increased from &euro;23,500 to &euro;24,000 to reflect the Budget 2018 increases in the Old Age Pension. </p><p>Whilst a student may not eligible for the special rate of maintenance grant, s/he may still qualify for other grant supports. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p></reply>

This large scale survey will look in detail at the experience of sexual violence and abuse in Ireland, with repeat large scale surveys every decade. The goal is for an ongoing programme of high quality research in a sensitive and ethical way, to ensure a robust set of data to inform Government policy. </p><p>Funding of &euro;150,000 was provided for 2019 to allow the CSO to carry out the preliminary technical research.  I am pleased to say that specific funding has also been provided in Budget 2020 for the next phase of this work. </p><p>The CSO has commenced preparatory work on the survey.  I am informed that to date, the preparatory phase has involved a wide consultation process, including an open town hall stakeholder event and establishment of two expert working groups and a broad Liaison Group for the project.</p><p>The preparatory phase includes consideration of best international practice and the refinement of data variables and questionnaire design as well as a full pilot survey in the field in 2020. </p><p>A specific section on the CSO website has been developed with information on the survey. The Deputy may find it helpful to consult that page </p><p>The Deputy also requested information in relation to the<b></b>consultation process engaged in and the location of the stakeholder event.  I am informed that the CSO met in March 2019 with key stakeholders at the Monitoring Committee of the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence.  A stakeholder information session was also organised in May 2019 at the Aisling Hotel, Dublin. </p><p>The Liaison Group has been established to facilitate meaningful consultation with the sexual violence sector in Ireland. It includes nominated experts from the University of Limerick and National University of Ireland Galway, representatives from relevant agencies including my Department, the Central Statistics Office, TUSLA, the Sexual Assault Treatment Unit, National Women's Council as well as representatives from Women&rsquo;s Aid, One in Four, Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and Rape Crisis Network Ireland.

This includes responsibility for deployment of personnel.  As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.  I understand, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>I have been informed by the Commissioner that to date, Divisional Protective Services Units have been established in DMR South Central, Waterford, Kerry, Kilkenny, Carlow, Limerick and Galway Garda Divisions. These are in addition to the units previously established in DMR West, Cork City and Louth Divisions in the initial phase of this initiative. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently welcomed the Garda Commissioner's adoption of a new Garda Operating Model which will see the number of Garda Divisions reduce from 28 to 19. This functional model has long been recommended by independent policing specialists, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and in the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI).  Rollout of this model meets a key commitment in <i>A Policing Service for the Future</i>, the four year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p><p>The Commissioner's plan allows for Divisions of sufficient scale to be self-sufficient in the delivery of services, which will included greater availability of expertise in addressing domestic and sexual violence in each area. </p><p>I am informed by Garda management that it is expected that Divisional Protective Services Units should be rolled-out to the remaining Garda Divisions on a phased basis by the end of 2019. </p><p>This expected timetable is in accordance with the target set out in <i>'A Policing Service for the Future'.</i></p></reply>

Significant progress has already been made, with 58% of all IDA client-supported employment now located outside of Dublin. This figure represents the highest such figure in the history of the Agency. Our aim remains to increase this percentage further by the end of this year. </p><p>When it comes to foreign direct investment (FDI), site visits do represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas. However, as I have said before, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. </p><p>I want to emphasise that the IDA does its utmost to encourage its clients to locate or expand in regional Ireland. This is just as much a priority for the Agency as it is for my Department and the Government. Indeed, the IDA has targeted an increase of investment of 30% to 40% in every region by the end of its current strategy, a goal it is working hard to achieve. At the same time, we must recognise that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the firm concerned. It is also the case, no matter what efforts we make to underline the undoubted benefits of regional locations, that certain overseas companies will only consider investing in large urban areas for various commercial or operational reasons. </p><p>The following table details the number of IDA site visits per county from 2018 until the second quarter of 2019.

This is addressed under Pillar 4 of our Future Jobs Ireland strategy. Pillar 4 is focused on increasing participation in the labour force as this will lead to the more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s economy.</p>  <p>  Ambition 4.2 under Pillar 4 of this strategy is to foster participation through flexible working solutions. This includes several deliverables aimed at promoting flexible working, including the production of guidelines for employers on flexible and family-friendly working options.  Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, compressed hours, job sharing, home-working and remote working. Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work life balance. It also provides solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so.  </p>  <p>  A key deliverable under this ambition is the completion of research on remote working. My Department is currently leading on this research which will focus on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements. The research will identify the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working. The final report will also include an international policy review which will consider related policies abroad, such as the right to disconnect in France. This will help to inform future policy on remote work. </p>  <p>  To guide this work, an Interdepartmental Steering Group has been formed with representatives across Government departments.  The study will include desk research, identification of key data sources and one-on-one consultation with key stakeholders. The results of the Remote Working Consultation Forum, which I hosted in Cavan Digital Hub in July, will further inform this research.</p>  <p>  The final report will be completed in Q4 of this year.</p></reply>

The Forum, which is chaired by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Minister Paschal Donohoe, meets approximately 4 times a year.  The first meeting each year is chaired by the Taoiseach.  The Forum provides a consultative informal structure for an exchange of views and dialogue on economic and social policies insofar as they affect employment and the workplace. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Budgetary process for the last 4 years, under the auspices of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, a National Economic Dialogue (NED) has taken place.  This year's event was held in Dublin Castle on 26-27th June.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work through LEEF and NED to strengthen the resilience of the economy and maximise opportunities to prepare our economy for the challenges ahead.</p></reply>

The aim of the Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. 13 Steering Group meetings have taken place with a further two meetings scheduled to take place this year. A large volume of its work has been completed.  </p>  <p>  To date the National Review has completed a public consultation survey, collated and analysed information on activity levels in each of the Hospital Groups and all hospitals within each Group. A successful and well attended stakeholder consultation was held in November 2018. The Health Research Board - Collaboration in Ireland for Clinical Effectiveness Reviews (HRB-CICER) has completed an Evidence Review of Specialist Cardiac Services looking at (i) international standards for PCI centres (ii) international models that might be applicable to the Irish Healthcare system and (iii) the relationship between volume and patient outcomes for PCI. The Evidence Review has provided important guidance for the Steering Group thus far and arising from discussions at the Steering Group they have been asked to complete one additional evidence review question.  Site visits to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) centres commenced earlier this year and will be complete this month. These site visits have included meetings with stakeholders in clinical, administrative, nursing and allied health professional roles. In addition two international site visits are being planned to review and benchmark against established cardiology networks. </p>  <p>  An additional workstream is being undertaken by the Health Intelligence Unit of the HSE with regards to Geospatial analysis and mapping of networks of cardiac services from a national perspective. </p>  <p>  The Chair is targeting that the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services will be completed before the end of the year and I would expect to be informed of any change to that timeline.  </p></reply>

As such, while this data is accurate as to which laboratories were used for women within the 221 group, I am informed that it would not be statistically sound to use it as a means of assessing the performance of any laboratory. The performance of laboratories used by CervicalCheck has been analysed and compared by Dr Scally, who has provided the necessary assurances in that regard.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the HSE made a strategic decision in 2018 to develop a national cervical screening laboratory, in conjunction with the Coombe Woman and Infants University Hospital.

Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have also been introduced.</p>  <p>  There has also been a significant expansion in the number of places on GP training programmes in recent years; up from 120 places in 2009 to 192 filled in 2019.</p>  <p>  An agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on contractual reform was concluded this year. In return for cooperation with a wide range of service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (or &euro;210 million) by 2023.</p>  <p>  This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease management programme. There will be a 10% increase in the rural GP allowance from 2020, an increase in the allowance paid to dispensing GPs, and a targeted fund of &euro;2 million will be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. Improvements in the maternity and paternity leave arrangements have also been agreed, in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors.</p></reply>

The Health budget increased by &euro;1.2 billion on 2019, a substantial additional level of funding. The amount allocated follows an extensive process of engagement between my Department and the Department of Expenditure and Reform, which considered both the funding requirements and the fiscal position. These types of engagements are a normal part of the Budgetary process and happen with Departments across Government. All Departments put forward spending proposals but are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il.  </p>  <p>  The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge for both the Irish and international Governments.  Despite welcome increases annually, the need for effective financial management remains crucial as the health service deals with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs associated with these service pressures will increasingly need to be managed not solely through annual increased Exchequer allocations but also through improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base. </p>  <p>  Funding is provided to the HSE for Health services in accordance with the letter of determination which sets out the approved level of overall HSE expenditure  for the year in question.  The determination for 2020 will issue shortly.   It is the responsibility of the HSE to manage the entire budget and prepare and  implement the National Service Plan which must under legislation,  set out the type and volume of health and personal social services, to be provided during the year in question within the funding allocated.  Both the additional funding allocated and additional value to be derived from improved efficiencies and productivity will be considered by the HSE in setting out its National Service Plan 2020. </p></reply>

This is a reduction of 7% (4,733) compared to September 2018. Of those patients, the numbers waiting over 3 months have decreased by 13% (5,718), and the numbers waiting over 12 months have decreased by 19% (2,474).</p>  <p>  While there has been considerable progress in the reduction of waiting times for Inpatient and Daycase treatments, I am conscious that the Outpatient Waiting List remains a significant challenge as demand for acute hospital services continues to grow. Waiting list figures for the end of September show that there are 568,769 patients on the outpatient waiting list. Of these, 59% (337,171) are waiting 9 months or less for an outpatient appointment and 69% (390,262) are waiting 12 months or less. Over the remainder of this year, the NTPF National Central Validation Unit will increase their activity which will see the validation of a further 100,000 patient files and with a particular focus on OPD waiting lists. </p>  <p>  More broadly, Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. The year-on-year increases to the National Treatment Purchase Fund since Budget 2017 reflect this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has established a Working Group comprised of representatives from the HSE, NTPF, and Departmental officials, to examine ways of improving access for patients waiting for scheduled care. Part of this work includes developing initiatives which will move care to the most appropriate setting, and at the lowest level of complexity. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. In this regard, the HSE National Service Plan 2020 will set out a planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to reduce inpatient/day case waiting lists, with a particular focus on improving access to hospital outpatient services. In 2020, the Department will also be asking the HSE and NTPF to work together with the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Office with the aim of driving sustainable improvements to service provision.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I encourage all hospital groups and individual hospitals to engage with the NTPF to identify waiting list proposals for the remainder of this year and for 2020.</p></reply>

The additional investment from the HSE in recent years and the impact of investment and the implementation of the Scoliosis 10 Point Action Plan for 2018/2019 is starting to deliver results. Across Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) a total of 418 surgical procedures were performed in 2018, compared with 371 in 2017 and 224 in 2016.</p>  <p>  In terms of driving sustainable improvements to accessing services, CHI advises that new processes have been implemented whereby all patients on the orthopaedic waiting list are clinically triaged by an Orthopaedic Consultant as to their clinical acuity, and any surgeries if required are carried out in order of clinical priority and waiting time.</p>  <p>  Since May 2018 CHI Crumlin have had an initiative in place to address long waiters on the OPD waiting lists. This has seen a reduction in the average waiting time for an OPD appointment from 248 patients waiting over 21 months in July 2018 to 45 patients waiting over 21 months in July 2019.</p>  <p>  In terms of activity to reduce waiting times to access services, CHI at Crumlin will be running additional spinal clinics to ensure that by year end no child is waiting longer than 12 months.</p>  <p>  In addition CHI at Temple Street forecast that no child will be waiting over 12 months for a spinal OPD appointment by year end, and are working to ensure that there are ongoing developments to maintain this target into 2020. </p>  <p>  CHI advises that the appointment of  two orthopaedic consultant surgeon posts is currently in progress and will have a positive impact on waiting times for patients for an OPD appointments for general orthopaedics, including scoliosis. These consultants will form part of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland&rsquo;s consultant team and will join a cross-city team of paediatric consultants who will deliver services at Crumlin and Temple Street as well as evolving the role of the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly which is part of the overall vision for a cross city Orthopaedic Service in CHI.</p>  <p>  In addition, two Consultant Anaesthesiologists (2WTE) have been appointed in CHI at Crumlin which has increased theatre capacity for orthopaedics. </p>  <p>  CHI is also working to recruit a consultant Neurophysiologist, which will allow CHI at Crumlin to develop a dedicated in-house spinal monitoring service</p>  <p>  The 2018 investment in paediatric orthopaedics included funding to support the transition of adolescents with scoliosis from CHI at Crumlin and Temple Street to the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH).  There are now agreed clinical pathways in place for the transition of adolescents (aged 16 years and over) waiting for a first time OPD/spinal review appointment.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  There are only three licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland. HPV2 protects against strains 2 of HPV that cause 70% of cervical cancers, HPV4 protects against 4 strains of HPV so it protects against 70% of cervical cancers and 90% of genital warts, and HPV9 which protects against 9 strains of HPV and so can provide protection against 90% of cervical cancers, other genital cancers and 90% of genital warts.</p>  <p>  The gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme for boys and girls in their first year of secondary school, which commenced in September, uses the HPV9 vaccine.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by the NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p></reply>

Currently, Ireland has 11 per cent of forest cover, up from just 1 per cent a century ago, and intends achieving 18 per cent cover by 2050.  This proposed venture between Coillte and Bord na Mona will help achieve these targets in line with our commitments under the Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  My Department published a paper in 2010 through the Council for Forestry Research and Development, COFORD, called &ldquo;The greenhouse gas balance of peatland forests&rdquo;. This paper highlighted the dynamics at play with regard to peatlands and peatland forests and their capacity to both emit carbon while also acting as an important carbon sink. This dynamic depends on site conditions, peat type and peatland development stage. Cutaway bogs, for example, which are the peatland type to be planted under the Coillte/Bord na Mona project, are understood to be emitting carbon on an ongoing basis as they already have been drained and as such the peat is subject to ongoing decomposition. </p>  <p>  In relation to the woodland types planned as part of the Coillte/Bord na Mona project, it is very difficult to provide an accurate assessment of the potential greenhouse gas balance of these new forests. Applications to begin planting have not yet been submitted to my Department for consent. Coillte and Bord na Mona are currently assessing a number of sites and will prepare an application which will include details of the location and extent of native woodland proposed.  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, based on research on the subject of carbon balance, it is reasonable to conclude that Woodland creation will accelerate the restoration of the carbon sink function on these peatland sites through new carbon stocks in biomass, woody debris and litter. The extent to which it does will depend on the relative balance between carbon uptake and loss. The proposed woodland creation on the Bord na Mona lands is one of a suite of land use options, which includes rewetting. Woodland creation as proposed represents a small area of the overall Bord na Mona land holding.</p></reply>

This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports already totalling 247,000 up until week commencing the 9th September. This is up from 207,000 for the same period in 2018 &ndash; a 19% increase. I  welcome the recent live cattle shipments to both Turkey and Libya.  </p>  <p>  Live exports are a critical part of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry.  They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers. My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its importance to the agri-food sector, while placing a strong emphasis on the welfare of all animals being transported.</p>  <p>  I will continue to prioritise efforts to deepen existing markets and gain access to new third country markets.  In 2017, my Department reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal, from &euro;4.80.  This gave an important boost to the trade in young calves, and brought greater equity in the fees payable for calves, weanlings and adult cattle.</p>  <p>  In April, my Department reached agreement with the Egyptian authorities on three proposed health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle. </p>  <p>  Also in April, agreement was reached in principle with Algeria to move from a joint breeding, slaughter and fattening certificate to three separate certificates. We are awaiting the Algerian authorities&rsquo; imprimatur prior to the commencement of the revised trade conditions.</p>  <p>  In relation to Turkey, my Department hosted a visit in May by a technical team that included officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and ESK (the Turkish Meat and Milk Board). </p>  <p>  With regard to lairage capacity in Cherbourg, my Department worked closely with the French authorities, and earlier this year, the French authorities approved an increase in holding capacity of the Qualivia in Cherbourg.  This provided for additional daily capacity for 400 animals, providing increased capacity of some 1, 200 animals per week. </p>  <p>  A successful live export trade relies on the cooperation of a multitude of stakeholders. Therefore, the recent establishment of the Irish Livestock Exporters' Association is to be welcomed. This body can represent the industry&rsquo;s views, not just to my Department, but also to ferry companies, port authorities, lairage operators and other stakeholders. </p>  <p>  At its request, I met the new Association in September to discuss a number of industry concerns.  I briefed the representative body on the progress made by my Department to source new markets as outlined above and I look forward to further engagement with the group in the future. </p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan sets out the necessary actions we must take to significantly cut our use of fossil fuels in electricity generation, in transport and in heating.  The Government has a fundamental duty to protect Ireland&rsquo;s energy security. In the next decade we will fully exit from peat and coal for electricity generation and we will go from 30% renewable electricity today to 70% renewable electricity in 2030. In making these critical changes, we must ensure that our energy security is maintained. It is critical to protecting our people, our homes, our farms, our hospitals and our businesses. </p><p>In reaching 70% renewable electricity in 2030, the balance will still have to be generated from fossil fuels<i>,</i>and from interconnectors/battery storage in 2030. Back-up supply will be needed in particular when the wind isn&rsquo;t blowing and when the sun isn&rsquo;t shining. For example, in a recent 30 day period, 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was provided by wind generation. However, over this same period, one day had only 4% of our electricity provided by wind and on another day it provided 62% of our electricity.</p><p>This back up supply is likely to be provided by gas. This view was backed in the recent advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council that said the continued exploration for, and recovery of new offshore natural gas reserves can be consistent with a low carbon transition.</p><p>However, we will carry out a comprehensive energy security review. It will consider, in a scientific way, how and from where fossil fuels are sourced during a transition to a carbon neutral economy. This review will consider: how we generate electricity when the wind isn&rsquo;t blowing and the sun isn&rsquo;t shining, the role for battery storage and the role for gas powered back up; the role of interconnection (both gas and electricity); and other ways to back up our power supply.</p><p>The Shannon LNG project is a private commercial project and any decisions on the future development of this project are matters for the project promoter. This has been designated as a project of common interest by the European Commission for 6 years: in 2013 and again in 2015, and 2017. There has been public consultation carried out by the European Commission when each list was being drawn up, and citizens, organisations and public authorities were invited to submit feedback on the inclusion of projects. The European Commission also carried out a public consultation in drawing up the draft 2019 list. </p><p>Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) are key infrastructure projects aimed at completing the European energy market in order to help the EU achieve its energy policy and climate objectives of affordable, secure and sustainable energy for all citizens, as well as the long-term decarbonisation of the economy in accordance with the Paris Agreement. </p><p>While Ireland has continued to support the inclusion of the Shannon LNG Project on the 4th PCI list as it enhances our energy security by increasing import route diversity, I have indicated that the government will only consider any future applications for EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding for LNG projects after a security of supply review has been completed and considered by the Government and the D&aacute;il, and only if the projects are consistent with national and EU climate policy objectives. </p><p>In that context, Ireland also enquired from the EU Commission whether the implications of importing LNG to the European Union, from conventional and unconventional fracked sources, have been examined in terms of a sustainable, secure and competitive European energy policy. The Commission advised that it had launched a study on methane emissions and agreed with the need to link gas imports to the objective of a climate neutral economy.</p></reply>

Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Ecology and Rehabilitation team are leaders in the area of peatlands rehabilitation. The company&rsquo;s rehabilitation principles have always been to re-wet peat where possible and to work in tandem with nature. Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s cutaway rehabilitation will mean that a heterogeneous mosaic of habitats will develop on the cutaway. </p>  <p>  On some Bord na M&oacute;na land it is not appropriate to raise water levels, as adjacent land and neighbours would be affected. It is also not practical or feasible to re-wet areas with significant slopes. </p>  <p>  It is natural that native trees will be a part of the Irish cutaway landscape due to the wide variability and environmental conditions across the cutaway. Much of the older Bord na M&oacute;na cutaway has already developed extensive bog woodland.</p>  <p>  Woodlands would have formed a natural part of raised bog habitats, located around the edge where peat was naturally thinner, but have largely been lost due to turf cutting and reclamation. All these woodland habitats will have significant biodiversity and conservation value and will increase the native woodland cover in Ireland. </p>  <p>  To address an evidence-gap in relation to the carbon fluxes from these types of bog woodlands, Bord na Mona has been supporting research into GHG fluxes from different peatland habitats for nearly 20 years. A GHG flux tower has been established at Lullymore to aid UCC, financially supported by Bord na M&oacute;na, study the carbon fluxes from a cutaway bog woodland site. </p>  <p>  Currently it is understood while that dry peat releases carbon dioxide, growing vegetation on top mitigates this, as the carbon is trapped by the vegetation. It is expected that these types of sites will remain a carbon source but that developing bog woodland will result in a reduction in carbon being emitted.</p></reply>

In May 2019 I brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p>  <p>  The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder.

In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p>  <p>  Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently.

A resilient and well connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic wellbeing and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.   In December 2016, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the project in Ireland, while in January 2018 full planning permission was granted for the section of the line that lies in Northern Ireland. Both of the planning decisions have been subject to legal proceedings in each jurisdiction. In Ireland, a Supreme Court appeal of the planning permission was dismissed on 19 February 2019. In Northern Ireland, on 8 February 2019, the Department for Infrastructure asked the High Court to quash the planning permission given so the planning application can be re-determined under new legislation introduced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in November 2018. On 24 July, SONI/EirGrid submitted an addendum to the Environmental Statement to the Department for Infrastructure in Belfast. That Department subsequently carried out a consultation process in Northern Ireland to provide members of the public with the opportunity to review and comment on the addendum and is now reviewing the submissions received. </p>  <p>  In June 2019, ESB Networks awarded a framework contract for the design, test and supply of steelwork in relation to the project. I am advised that the design and testing part of the contract will commence shortly. However under the framework there will be no supply of materials until the planning process in Northern Ireland is complete.</p>  <p>  The earliest possible date for construction to commence is 2020.</p></reply>

Accordingly, decisions regarding particular promotional channels or campaigns &ndash; such as those relating to greyhound racing &ndash; are operational matters for the tourism agencies.</p><p>As regards Ireland&rsquo;s greyhound industry, recent coverage and debate regarding alleged cruel practices has certainly damaged the reputation of the industry.  I know that my colleague, Minister of State Doyle, who has responsibility for the greyhound sector, takes these allegations very seriously and has directed the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter.  I am confident that Minister Doyle and his Department, in cooperation with Bord na gCon, will ensure that any issues identified will be addressed appropriately.</p><p>As regards tourism marketing and promotions, I am very concerned about consequential damage to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a tourist destination.  While work is underway to right the wrongs and rehabilitate the industry and its reputation, we must be careful not to allow current negative publicity damage our tourism promotions.

The Convention will be brought into effect immediately in the event of there being no Brexit deal or at the end of the transition period in the event of a deal.  </p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s Winter Fuel Payment (WFP) is a Department of Work &amp;amp; Pensions payment which is not currently paid on a reciprocal basis.   Furthermore, I am advised that there has been no indication that the UK has any plans to make changes with regard to WFP recipients in Ireland, whether or not there is a Brexit deal.   </p>  <p>  With regard to our own fuel allowance, just this week, in Budget 2020, I increased the rate of payment by &euro;2 per week to &euro;24.50 per week from January.

An increased payment can be made where full-time care is being provided to two people. </p>  <p>   My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers, ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>   Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Long term social welfare schemes such Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (CA), with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process.  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to CA, evidence must be provided in respect of the care recipient&rsquo;s care requirement, the level of care the carer provides and the carer's means. This is prolonged further if the documentary evidence provided at initial application stage is incomplete or insufficient; this is often the case with carer&rsquo;s allowance applications. Medical Assessors have access to a customer CA claim inside a few days of the Department receiving the application. </p>  <p>  The average processing time for the award of a Carer's Allowance claim from January 2019 to September 2019 was 14 weeks. Staff have recently been re-assigned to the CA area to work on claims processing and this should lead to a reduction in processing times.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This forms part of the work programme of An F&oacute;ram.  </p>  <p>  The issue of a rating system is just one element of promoting water conservation. Reflecting the provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2017 and, in line with the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, the Water Services Policy Statement supports the promotion of water conservation and water resource management as an important element of water services policy that is reflected in strategic investment planning by Irish Water. For the period of the Policy Statement, this involves the prioritisation of multifaceted programmes around leak detection and repair, network improvements, cost effective metering, public awareness campaigns and funding to fix customer side leaks. The National Leakage Reduction Programme in particular includes investment of some &euro;250 million over the next four years under the Find and Fix repair scheme and the Water Mains Rehabilitation programme.</p>  <p>  Legislative provision to discourage the excessive use of water services was included in the Water Services Act 2017. Excessive usage is determined by reference to the threshold amount of 213,000 litres per household per annum as specified by ministerial order with effect from 1 January 2018, in line with provisions contained in sections 8 and 9 of the Water Services Act 2017.</p>  <p>  Irish Water is responsible for developing and implementing the necessary administrative arrangements, including billing arrangements, subject to oversight and approval by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that in July  2019, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) announced its final determination, following a comprehensive public consultation process, on the new excessive usage charges and charging arrangements that will apply to domestic households deemed to be using water services excessively i.e. using water services above the annual threshold allowance of 213,000 litres per household. The charges and charging arrangements now in place are consistent with the comprehensive overview set out in my letter of 15 July 2019 to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p>  <p>  The overall aim is to encourage water conservation rather than to generate revenue.  On this basis, I understand that Irish Water will work proactively with relevant customers to identify whatever practical steps may be necessary in order to address their situation and bring their consumption back within the threshold level.   Additional allowance amounts for water usage will be available to larger households (where the number of residents exceeds four) and exemptions will be available in cases of medical need.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee recommended a proactive approach to promoting awareness of water conservation, and Irish Water places a strong emphasis on this important area. A dedicated section on the Irish Water website provides information in relation to water conservation at www.water.ie/bewatersmart. The content includes suggested lifestyle changes to save water and information on how to check for water leaks in the home. Information is also available on water saving devices outside of the home, including rainwater butts and rainwater reuse for the farming sector. </p>  <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s website also has a facility where members of the public can report leaks in public areas. Based on the information provided, Irish Water will follow up to confirm a leak on the public mains and complete a repair. </p>  <p>  Irish Water also supports a number of environmental education campaigns which raise awareness, promote understanding and encourage people to take action on water conservation issues. This includes the Green Schools Programme, which has delivered savings of 360 million litres of water in schools in one year alone. Irish Water has also engaged with primary and secondary schools as part of Engineers Ireland&rsquo;s Engineers Week, to increase knowledge and awareness of water conservation and its benefits to the environment. </p>  <p>  In addition, Irish Water has undertaken a research study to provide an in-depth understanding of household water usage.  The findings, which show that, in general, people agree with the need to value and conserve water, will help guide the roll out of product and behavioural interventions to improve water conservation in Ireland. </p></reply>

Irish Water is the lead authority in relation to the management and conservation of public water supplies.</p>  <p>  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with the EPA in relation to its role in respect of water and wastewater services, including with regard to the resource implications arising from its responsibilities. Under its Water Quality Programme, my Department funds the EPA to conduct a range of activities to facilitate and support the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive, including the water quality monitoring of rivers, lakes, estuaries and groundwater.</p>  <p>  In relation to research matters it should be noted that funding for the EPA's research programme on climate, sustainability and water is allocated under the Vote of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  Proposals in relation to water related research are evaluated by the Water Research Co-ordination Group, which includes representation from my Department together with other relevant Departments and agencies and which takes on board national policy on water conservation as set out in the Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025, which in turn takes account of the 2017 Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services which was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

As the full impact of both of these provisions would only become fully evident over the course of an extended period the appropriate timing for the undertaking of a Post Enactment Report of this Act remains under consideration.</p><p>The conduct of post enactment reports in respect of the National Archives (Amendment) Act 2018, the Heritage Act 2018, and the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act 2018, all of which were enacted in 2018,  will also be considered in due course.</p></reply>

In this regard, the NIAH survey for County Galway included eleven piers, which would have been part of the Ministerial Recommendations to the Council for inclusion on their RPS. While An Sruth&aacute;n pier was not included in the NIAH survey it remains the case that the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, the RPS for County Galway is a reserved function of Galway County Council.</p>  <p>  In addition, under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014, my Department maintains the Record of Monuments and Places (RMP), which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.  Anyone proposing works to a monument that is recorded must give my Department two months notice before works can start.  I understand that An Sruth&aacute;n pier is not on the RMP, however the National Monuments Service of my Department is currently investigating whether there are sites in the vicinity of the pier which may be of archaeological interest.</p></reply>
