The continued contribution of so many people in all walks of life has been essential to getting us through this difficult time. Collaboration and solidarity have been the hallmark of our national approach to COVID-19 and the measures announced on 19 January are true to those principles. </p><p>After careful consideration, the Government made the decision to give all the people of Ireland a national day of recognition and commemoration on the 18<sup>th</sup>of March this year, and another permanent public holiday in February commencing in 2023. </p><p>The Government took many factors into consideration when coming to a decision in relation to any additional recognition measure for specific sectors.  It ultimately agreed that contribution of every sector is to be acknowledged through the introduction of a new public holiday.At the same time it decided that it was appropriate to acknowledge certain frontline healthcare workers in the public sector and in private nursing homes and hospices in particular through a special recognition payment.  </p><p>This is a balanced package of measures that will benefit all workers across the economy, while also recognising in particular the risks faced by certain frontline healthcare workers during this pandemic. </p><p>The Department of Health is working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply. This will be published as soon as possible. This work underway is to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended.</p></reply>

This Framework focuses on the longer-term approach to remote working in the sector and can assist in providing a consistent approach across the wider public sector. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Blended Working Policy Framework will be finalised shortly, following conclusion of the engagement with employee representatives.  Once finalised, the Framework will be rolled out to all civil service organisations and will inform the development of organisational blended working policies which will be tailored to meet the specific requirements of each Department/Office.  On completion, each Department/Office will progressively roll out their blended working policies and implementation plans. </p>  <p>  In line with Government commitments, the Civil Service will demonstrate leadership in moving proactively to this new blended working environment with a view to achieving at least 20% remote working initially, depending on the needs of the business. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-01a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100070#WRB00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 70 together.</p>  <p>As the Deputy might appreciate, issues involving the pension schemes in relation to the Commercial Semi State companies can be complex. They also involve a range of different stakeholders and are influenced by a number of different factors such as those which impact on the overall value of pension funds. There is also a historical context to the position of these schemes many of which have faced financial challenges over many years.</p>  <p>  I would like to take the opportunity to briefly outline the background to some of these  issues before highlighting the key factors to be considered in the development of proposals for discretionary pension increases as well as the process by which these proposals are brought forward.</p>  <p>  As you now, many of the pension schemes for the Commercial Semi State Bodies experienced a deterioration of their overall financial position during the financial crisis. Difficult measures had to be taken in some cases to ensure their survival. A large number of the schemes are still in deficit.  </p>  <p>  This means that along with relevant policy considerations, the extent of precedents and consistency with scheme rules, the overall funding position of the relevant pension scheme is one of the most important factors in considering any pension scheme proposals. Any measure which has the potential to negatively impact on the financial health of a pension scheme must be carefully evaluated.</p>  <p>  This also applies to proposals for discretionary pension increases. Many of the pension schemes in the Commercial Semi State sector have not had pension increases for this reason. As a result, the understandable desire of retired scheme members for pension increases must be balanced with the overall protection of pension benefits for all members of a pension scheme and with the long term survival of schemes. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, if pension increases are not affordable, it can lead to a failure to meet the statutory funding standard, which in turn can trigger the need for more difficult measures to restore the financial position of a pension scheme. </p>  <p>  As the key stakeholders involved in considering these proposals, the parent Department along with the relevant scheme trustees  and the scheme employer all play an important role in ensuring that the full impact of pension increases on the sustainability of the pension funds is carefully assessed along with all the other policy considerations before proposals are finalised</p>  <p>  The normal process by which these requests are advanced involves the parent Government Department under whose aegis responsibility for individual Commercial Semi State Bodies falls considering and approving any changes to pension scheme rules or discretionary benefits.</p>  <p>  My Department then considers these proposals when a fully completed set of business case and technical assessment documents are submitted in line with the standard governance requirements. This includes the advice from NewEra. This process applies to all proposals including the RT&Eacute; pension scheme before they are brought forward for my consent.</p>  <p>   In relation to your other parliamentary question, the full set of documents have not yet been received by this Department in relation to both the RT&Eacute; scheme and the Dublin Port scheme proposals. As you can appreciate, it can take some effort to assemble and review the full range of technical material required.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are available to consider these matters once all the necessary financial and actuarial analysis is carried out and the governance requirements have been met. </p>  <p>  Overall, while I understand the sensitivity of pension increase matters, the issues involved are not necessarily straightforward and the full impact of proposals have to be considered, not least on the long term viability of schemes.</p></reply>

Supports were introduced swiftly in 2020, with a range of schemes introduced to support incomes, employment and key public services. Over &euro;16&frac12; billion in funding was made available for measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic during 2020, which provided for essential economic and societal supports. This provided additional funding to support our health service in responding to the impact of the pandemic; to support the operation of public transport; and support the reopening of the Education sector. These measures included income and employment support schemes such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), along with a range of other business supports such as liquidity supports, restart grants and the commercial rates waivers. </p>  <p>  During 2021, as Covid-19 continued to impact, key schemes and supports were extended.  In addition to the measures provided for by allocations made to Departments in the Revised Estimates for Covid-19 related measures, the funding held in reserve under Budget 2021 was allocated during the year to provide for measures such as the further extension of the PUP and EWSS schemes, additional supports for businesses and particularly impacted sectors such as live entertainment. Across the year, provision of almost &euro;13&frac12; billion was made for Covid-19 related measures. </p>  <p>  For 2022, &euro;3.1 billion in funding to address the impacts of Covid-19 has already been allocated at Departmental level in the 2022 Revised Estimates, including &euro;0.2 billion for projects funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. A further &euro;3.9 billion remains held in reserve, to be allocated if required during the year for targeted measures to address the continued challenges caused by the pandemic. Within this, specific amounts have been earmarked for the Education and Health sectors and for labour market impacts. The contingency funding will be used to support our economy and society over the coming year and will be allocated to specific expenditure measures that can be most effective at that particular time. </p></reply>

Just over &euro;4 billion of this amount was held in reserve.</p>  <p>  In REV 2022, just under &euro;0.1 of the contingency was allocated with &euro;51 million to Education for term 2 Covid-19 measures, &euro;25 million for Live Entertainment, &euro;10 million for a support scheme for travel agents, and &euro;10 million for a Covid mitigation redundancy and insolvency scheme. </p>  <p>  Key measures have been extended as necessary since the beginning of the pandemic in order to continue essential support, most recently in response to the impact of the Omicron wave where a number of further measures were agreed by Government including for the EWSS and PUP and in respect of a further Commercial Rates Waiver for particularly impacted sectors.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022, set out the planned phasing out of the EWSS. Reflecting the impact of the public health response to Omicron, Government agreed to extend the enhanced rate of subsidy for a further two months across December 2021 and January 2022 and also to the reopening of the scheme for certain businesses.</p>  <p>  In January, Government agreed that businesses availing of EWSS that were directly impacted by the Public Health Regulations introduced in December, would continue to receive the enhanced rates of subsidy for the month of February, with the graduated step-down in subsidy rates being delayed by one month. Such firms would continue to receive support under the scheme until 31 May 2022.</p>  <p>  Any additional costs arising from these measures, along with costs due to increased demand on testing and on the Covid Illness Benefit Scheme, would fall to be met from the contingency reserve. This will leave funds available in the reserve to be allocated, if required, for targeted measures depending on the situation with the virus later in the year. </p></reply>

We aim to redefine and encompass techniques which are both compliant as well as being the best solutions for the built environment encompassed within our area of responsibility. This approach benefits all of society and re-frames and prioritises the work of OPW architects, engineers, surveyors, district inspectors, clerks of works and other stakeholders working directly with us or acting on our behalf. This in turn enhances the experiences of building users and ensures Accessibility and Universal Design principles permeate all aspects of the built environment to which the public have the right to access through application of our Codes of Practice, our Technical Guidance Documents and our Building Regulations.  </p><p>Accessibility audit reviews of a prioritised list of OPW buildings, to which the public have access countrywide, are being carried out at the moment, by a combination of our own technical staff resources and external consultants. Due to the pandemic most of our planned audits were postponed but the intention is to advance on these as a priority over the coming months. </p><p>Access audits are the mechanism for producing evidence based data for the works to be undertaken. This is informed by a set of criteria as set out by Part M of the Technical Guidance Documents of the building regulations. A priority list and the urgency of the works is set out at the start of each year with each regional manager and the Universal Access Programme budget holder. Since March 2020 the programme has been delayed by Covid-19 and for the most part progress halted where we could not visit sites. Our teams would require additional resources for what would be an extensive roll out programme across the entire estate. This is the current position as of 28th February 2022. Even with progress to date we fully appreciate that we must further strive to create a built environment best suited and equipped to ensure all our citizens are treated with dignity and consideration.  Since the publication of the I.S. EN 17161:2019 standard on Design for All in 2019, we have looked forward to moving towards wider application of the Universal Design principles in our buildings and sites. This will shortly  benefit from the suite of amendments under consideration to Technical Guidance Document Part M for the provision of Changing Places Facilities in specific settings. (Proposed legislation: Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2022).</p><p>In December 2020, in support of Government policy on advancing the rights and inclusion of people with disabilities, Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage established a Working Group to examine the provision of a Changing Places facility in certain buildings. The Working Group has now recommended the types and sizes of buildings where a changing places toilet should be required, along with the technical requirements (equipment, room size and layout) of a changing places toilet. </p><p>The public consultation was launched on 9 February 2022, which seeks submissions, observations and comments on a proposed amendment to the Building Regulations and associated Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use to make provision for a changing places toilet in certain buildings.</p><p>To assist in this process, the following documents are available on the Department's website <i>www.gov.ie/en/consultation/247d5-public-consultation-on-the-review-of-building-regulations-part-m-access-and-use-to-make-provision-for-a-changing-places-toilet-in-certain-buildings/</i></p><p>and interested parties will have until 12 May 2022 to submit their comments:</p><p>- Draft Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2022</p><p>--Draft Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use 2022</p><p>- A Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis </p><p>- An easy read consultation document</p><p>- A template for submissions</p></reply>

In 2002, gross voted expenditure was just over &euro;31.3 billion. This compares to total gross voted expenditure of up to &euro;87.6 billion under Budget 2022. </p><p>Growth in gross voted expenditure over the 20 year timeframe to 2019, prior to the onset of Covid-19, was considered in conjunction with revenue and economic growth when setting the Medium Term Expenditure Strategy, published last July in the Summer Economic Statement, which lays out planned expenditure ceilings to 2025. </p><p>Gross voted expenditure grew at an annual average of 5.6% across this period, with the most recent five year interval of this time frame, the period from 2014 to 2019 showing annual average voted expenditure growth of c. 5%, broadly in line with growth in the economy as measured by GNI*. These increases supported incremental improvements in the provision of day-to-day services and social supports and significant uplifts in public investment and put the public finances in a position to support the significant fiscal response to Covid-19.</p></reply>

These measures seek to assist households on lower incomes and other families who are facing increased energy bills, and are set within an overall fiscal framework that seeks to ensure that we have the resources to deliver on our commitments to better services for our people.  The total gross cost of this package is expected to be c.&euro;527 million.</p>  <p>  The Revised Estimates 2022 set out an Government Expenditure Ceiling of &euro;87,593 million, including funding already allocated to Departments of almost &euro;83 billion with further amounts totalling just over &euro;4.6 billion held in reserve. At this stage the costs of the package of measures are expected to be met from within the overall Government Expenditure Ceiling. </p>  <p>  Government is acutely aware of the need to provide support to households that are experiencing difficulties, and is also mindful of the need to ensure that our public finances return to a sustainable position and to avoid actions that could result in increased inflation. Sustainable public finances are essential to deliver improvements in key public services and infrastructure for our people. In this context, the package has focused on one-off temporary support measures that can quickly provide assistance to households, without pre-committing significant funding from the available resources for Budget 2023. </p></reply>

These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices.</p><p>The current public service agreement is Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022. This Agreement is weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments.</p><p>The Agreement provides for the following pay adjustments:</p><p>-  A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on 1 October 2021.</p><p>- The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1 February 2022. </p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1 October 2022.</p><p>- The Government is determined to ensure the current pay agreement is honoured in full. In this regard, an independent body was established to examine the additional hours worked by public servants under the Haddington Road Agreement. The full report of the Body has now been submitted and is under consideration. I expect to bring the report to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, Building Momentum is a two year Agreement, which is due to expire at the end of 2022. Accordingly, Government and public service staff representatives will be due to enter into discussions on the potential for a successor agreement later this year. I expect that the inflation and cost of living issues to which the Deputies have referred will feature in those discussions.</p></reply>

Under the European Union Procurement Directives, cost may be calculated using Life-Cycle Costing (LCC), which takes into account costs at end-of-life, such as those associated with disposal, as well as operational costs, such as energy use, and purchase price and associated costs, such as delivery. LCC may also include the cost of externalities, such as greenhouse gas emissions. The Directives allow inclusion of criteria relating to any stage in a product&rsquo;s life-cycle, including production and end-of-life. Such criteria must be defined, quantifiable, verifiable, and measurable.</p>  <p>  In 2019, my Department published Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement. This instructs Departments to consider using green criteria in their procurements. In 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published updated and expanded &lsquo;Green Public Procurement &ndash; Guidance for the Public Sector&rsquo;, accompanied by 10 sets of green criteria. These are mostly modelled on EU Green Public Procurement (GPP) criteria, which were developed using Life-Cycle Assessment i.e. considering environmental impacts throughout the entire life-cycle. The EPA, Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), and the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) have all actively promoted use of these criteria and the guidance. The guidance includes a section specifically on GPP and the Circular Economy. Elsewhere, it highlights circular approaches such as reuse, procurement of products with recycled content, resource sharing, procuring equipment that can be adapted over time or repaired, and LCC.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the establishment of an Environmental subgroup of the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, co-chaired by the OGP Policy and the Circular Economy unit in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, has ensured coordination between Circular Economy policy and public procurement.</p></reply>

A stay was also granted on works being carried out pursuant to the Decision, pending the resolution of these proceedings.</p>  <p>  Following an extensive legal review of the grounds of the Judicial Review, and the statutory processes around the decision-making process, the Department of Public Expenditure has agreed to consent to an order reverting the evaluation of the Blackpool Flood Relief scheme back to an advanced stage of further public consultation. In agreeing to this, the Department of Public Expenditure has conceded the matter on a single ground related to public consultation procedures on certain information as part of the confirmation process.</p>  <p>  Two other flood relief schemes are also currently under consideration by the Minister for Expenditure and Reform for Ministerial Confirmation pursuant to the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995 (as amended). These are the River Slaney (Enniscorthy) Scheme, and the River Deel (Crossmolina) Scheme.  </p>  <p>  In respect of any schemes submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for confirmation, it is important to note that, under Section 7.E of the Arterial Drainage Act Regulations 2019, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can (a) make an order confirming the scheme, (b) refuse to confirm the scheme, or (c) refer the scheme back to the Commissioners of Public Works for revision in specified respects.  </p>  <p>  It is necessary therefore to ensure that all legal requirements, including any existing or emerging case law, have been fully considered and complied with when making and confirming his decision in respect of any schemes, including those mentioned above, to ensure that decisions are robust as any decision taken by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under Section 7.E(a), (b) or (c) is subject to Judicial Review. </p>  <p>  The confirmation process for these schemes is a matter for the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform.

This report examined, inter alia, issues around the demand for the data concerned; methodologies and technologies used; the potential for direct provision by the State of these services itself, and; the maturity of the market to provide these services efficiently. On foot of this report, my Department decided in 2020 that the business case for its continued funding of Benefacts was no longer justified and accordingly the decision was made to terminate funding. This decision was notified to the Chairperson of the Board of Benefacts and other relevant stakeholders from June 2020.</p>  <p>  It was originally intended to terminate the funding arrangement in December 2020 but, in recognition that other public service bodies with direct policy involvement in the not-for-profit sector may have wished to consider whether they had an appreciable business case to continue funding Benefacts, my Department agreed to fund the initiative up to the end of 2021. This provision was made to facilitate relevant public service bodies to consider their position and to assess all of the options in relation to their respective business needs concerning data on the not-for-profit sector. </p>  <p>  In April 2021, my Department reaffirmed its 2020 decision to relevant parties concerned. Furthermore, in acknowledgment of the impact of Covid-19 on this deliberative process, a final three month extension of funding up to the 31st March 2022 was sanctioned late last year.  As of February 2022, no department or agency has identified an appreciable business to fund the service. </p>  <p>  I understand Benefacts did raise the possibility of alternative institutional and governance arrangements, however these proposals did not address all of the key matters identified in the review undertaken in 2020.  </p>  <p>  The factors influencing the original decision from 2020  have not changed materially and, consequently, the decision of my Department to terminate the funding remains unaltered. My officials are continuing to work closely with the staff and Board of Benefacts to ensure that all necessary requirements as part of its cessation plan can be met. </p>  <p>  My Department understands that the Department of Rural and Community Development have indicated a willingness to explore whether a need to develop a different database for not-for-profit sector exists, in addition to the database already provided by the Charities Regulator. Issues in relation to any such potential proposal are a matter for the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p></reply>

Later last year, Government acted quickly to respond to the increase in energy costs by committing to an energy credit of &euro;100 for all domestic account holders. With this earlier energy credit commitment, the package of measures announced post-Budget 2022 has a value of some half a billion euro. The package comprises:</p><p>A lump sum payment of &euro;125 to recipients of Fuel Allowance to be paid in March;</p><p>- An increase in the Energy Credit payment announced in December from &euro;100 exclusive of VAT to &euro;200 inclusive of VAT; </p><p>- Applying the Budget 2022 increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment from April rather than June;</p><p>- Further reducing the Drugs Payment Scheme threshold to &euro;80 per month, having been reduced to &euro;100 per month in Budget 2022; </p><p>- Reducing the maximum annual School Transport charge to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year;</p><p>- A 20% reduction in PSO Public Transport fares from May until the end of 2022.</p><p>While this will not combat the causes of the inflation we are currently seeing, which is mainly due to external factors such as higher oil prices and pandemic-induced supply chain bottlenecks in key regions along with the rapid rebound in the domestic economy, it will provide timely support to all households who may be experiencing difficulties as a result of rising prices. The package sought to balance targeting the main underlying problem of higher energy prices with the need to operate with the fiscal framework set out in the Summer Economic Statement and so has been designed to specifically target energy costs, while using the social welfare system to target additional support to those who are in receipt of the fuel allowance.</p><p>A range of budgetary reforms have been put in place in recent years, to drive spending efficiency and effectiveness and the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the budgetary process. This work includes the &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework, the Spending Review process, Performance Budgeting and Equality Budgeting and the development of the Wellbeing Framework for Ireland.</p><p>Given the significant level of resources to be provided under the medium term expenditure strategy, an ongoing and enhanced focus on value for money is required, looking at the quality of expenditure and what it delivers for citizens. It is in this context that all expenditure decisions will be taken, as part of the Budget 2023 process, to examine any further measures that may be required to address cost of living issues. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-01a.91.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100071#WRC00400"><p>Firstly, I&rsquo;d like to thank Deputy Stanton for his question in relation to Annes Grove House and Gardens, in Castletownroche, Co. Cork.</p>  <p>  The gardens at Annes Grove are of international significance, primarily because of their famous plant collection which contains an outstanding range of rhododendron species. The Grove Annesley family nurtured and developed a unique landscape over multiple generations until they generously donated the Estate to the Irish people in 2015. The majority of the gardens today dates from the early 20th century which was developed under the stewardship of Richard Grove Annesley. He was an avid plant collector and supported several plant hunting expeditions during the first half of the 20th   century, notably the expeditions of Frank Kingdon-Ward. The great history of plant collecting in Ireland across the centuries is to some extent, not widely understood or appreciated and so the renovation of Annes Grove House and Gardens offers a unique opportunity to explore this aspect of our great historic gardens which are part of our national heritage.</p>  <p>  Annes Grove is also an exemplar Robinsonian-style garden in Ireland, situated adjacent to the river Awbeg. The Robinsonian method was developed by William Robinson, from Co. Waterford, who championed a naturalistic approach to garden design and promoted the concept of the &lsquo;wild garden&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  Since 2015, The Office of Public Works (OPW) has managed and conserved the Estate on behalf of the people of Ireland. The Estate consists of 190 acres, encompassing the Demesne, gardens, parkland, 18th century house and outbuildings. This first phase of capital works is coming to a close in quarter one of 2022, with a total investment of &euro;2,162,935.19 to date, by the OPW.  </p>  <p>  Phase 1 identified areas for immediate attention, such as, commencing the restoration of the gardens, and of outbuildings in very poor repair and in danger of subsequent collapse. Throughout 2016 &ndash; 2019, good progress was made on repairing/rebuilding estate walls, roads, paths and car parking facilities. Windows and plasterwork were restored to the front of the house and new roofs installed on some of the 18th century farm yard buildings. Many overgrown areas were cut back and replanting works commenced.</p>  <p>  I understand from my officials that, in 2019, the OPW commissioned a Conservation Management Plan (CMP) of Annes Grove House &amp;amp; Gardens to describe the history and significance of the site, identify issues and threats and to outline conservation and design strategies. This document will inform future decisions regarding the management of the Estate. From 2020 &ndash; 2021, the OPW completed emergency repair works to the roof of the stable buildings in the north courtyard to prevent them from collapse and provided urgent repairs to paths, steps and ancillary works to the gardens to facilitate a 2022 opening to the public. </p>  <p>  The OPW is currently scoping and planning a second phase of capital works for Annes Grove. In 2019, the OPW was successful in seeking funding under the Rural Regeneration Development Fund and was awarded &euro;375,000 in grant funding to appoint an Integrated Design Team, led by Howley Hayes Cooney Architects to bring this Phase 2 scheme to planning application stage in 2022. This planning application will seek permission for the refurbishment and development of visitor facilities on site, such as, ticket office, caf&eacute;, exhibition spaces, and conservation of the main House for interpretation of the history of Annes Grove and its unique plant collection. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that Annes Grove Gardens will become a strong destination for visitors, particularly international visitors with an interest in gardens. With its close proximity to Doneraile Court and Estate which is just ten kilometres away, the OPW plans to market both heritage attractions as a package of designed landscapes and gardens in north Cork, managed and operated by the OPW.</p>  <p>  The OPW is committed to working with local stakeholders to ensure the re-opening of Annes Grove provides a sustainable, economic and social benefit to the local community, and that it will support tourism in the local area. My officials are working closely with the Grove Annesley family who have preserved and cared for the Estate throughout the generations, Ballyhoura Development, Avondhu Blackwater Partnership, Cork County Council and members of the public and local community interest groups to ensure the future success of Annes Grove as a new visitor destination in North Cork.</p>  <p>  The scale of ambition for Annes Grove is substantial and is subject to available funding and resources. As a result, the OPW plans to open the site on a phased basis, beginning in 2022 with an initial offering where visitors access the extensive garden and riverside walks and enjoy a catering offering on site. The gardens will be accessible by paid guided tour only which will concentrate on the gardens and the internationally significant plant collection. Visitors will also have opportunities to explore some areas of the restored courtyards. </p>  <p>  I look forward to joining the Deputy and other local stakeholders in mid-late April of this year as we celebrate the opening of Annes Grove gardens to the public.</p></reply>

This instructs Departments to consider using green criteria in their procurements, and to include green considerations in the planning and reporting cycles. The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) fully embraces switching to green procurement. A key objective in the OGP's Statement of Strategy is enabling better and more transparent public procurement that is socially, environmentally, and economically sustainable through guidance, advisory services, and training. This includes embedding strategic public procurement, which includes green and social considerations, in procurement policy and in the OGP&rsquo;s next generation procurement solutions.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, chaired by the OGP, promotes the incorporation of strategic considerations into public procurement projects. In 2021, the OGP and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications established and co-chair an Environmental subgroup to facilitate more detailed, technical, discussion of issues relating to green public procurement (GPP) and broader sustainability and climate considerations in public procurement.</p>  <p>  Further to ongoing engagement by OGP officials in recent years in explaining and promoting green public procurement, the OGP recently hosted a Conference &lsquo;Go Green: From Policy to Practice&rsquo;, which highlighted examples of the transition to green procurement both within the OGP and across a number of public sector bodies.</p>  <p>  The line with the Programme for Government the OGP and its partner Central Purchasing Bodies (CPBs) have been reviewing all central purchasing arrangements to identify opportunities to include green considerations. 165 central arrangements had been updated to include green criteria by the end of 2021. A further 41 arrangements will be updated to include green criteria this year and next. </p></reply>

The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and effective condition. These embankments are not in State ownership but are on lands that are, for the most part, privately owned. I am advised that these embankments were not designed or constructed to cater for cycleways or walkways and might not have the capability to have any sort of walking or cycling infrastructure placed on top of them. </p></reply>

In brief, this Review is examining:</p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s existing ethics legislative framework, </p><p>- The recommendations of relevant tribunals of inquiry,</p><p>- Recommendations made by the Standards in Public Office Commission based on its operation of the current regime,</p><p>- The views of key stakeholders;</p><p>- Current EU/international best practice; and</p><p>- The views submitted by way of a public consultation.</p><p>Formal stakeholder engagement for the Review commenced in November. A public consultation exercise launched in November and closed in mid-January 2022. Key elements of context for the draft review report&rsquo;s findings have been drafted, including a detailed survey of Ireland's current provisions, and a survey of the arrangements in a number of relevant and comparable jurisdictions. An initial engagement has also taken place with relevant Government Departments and the Office of the Attorney General.</p><p>I expect the Review to be completed by end June. The outcome will then inform proposals for legislative reform that I  intend to bring to Government later this year. In seeking to develop a renewed legislative initiative, my Department will take as its point of departure the policy approach underlying the 2015 Public Sector Standards Bill (and set out in November's Public Consultation Paper), which lapsed when the D&aacute;il was dissolved in January 2020 in advance of the last General Election. Very broadly, this involves consolidation of the statutory framework for ethics and giving effect to relevant recommendations of the Mahon and Moriarty Tribunals.</p></reply>

The provisions of Circular 13/2014 apply to the movement of funds from a Vote to an outside body, and to any/all onward movements of that funding. The objective is to ensure that all Exchequer funds, regardless of the method of distribution, are accounted for and properly managed.  </p>  <p>  The circular sets out details of the responsibilities of both grantor and grantee organisations.

It is an ongoing requirement for all Departments to review their systems of financial control, which would include issues arising in terms of the implementation of the circular. Where weaknesses emerge, through such reviews, or other processes like internal audit, it is a matter for the Department concerned to take actions to strengthen the controls in place. </p></reply>

This package included: </p><p>- An increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households.</p><p>- A lump sum payment of &euro;125 to be paid in March to fuel allowance recipients.</p><p>- To reduce the burden on people returning to the workplace and other people using public transport, there will be a temporary reduction in fares of 20% on PSO public transport services from early May to the end of the year. This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users.</p><p>- The Drug Payment Scheme threshold will be further reduced to &euro;80 per month, having been reduced to &euro;100 per month in Budget 2022. This will benefit just over 70,000 recipients.</p><p>- The increase in the threshold for the working family payment announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from June to April.</p><p>- Reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children for the next academic year. </p></reply>

Unfortunately, in recent years there have been increases in reports of damage to archaeological monuments including Loughcrew Cairns.  As a result, promotional efforts relating to Loughcrew will focus on reminding people of the importance of protecting this significant heritage site and, indeed, all of our country&rsquo;s unique archaeological and architectural heritage sites, many of which are extremely vulnerable.</p>  <p>  This messaging strategy follows on from the &lsquo;Protect our Past&rsquo; campaign run jointly by the OPW and the National Monuments Service of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in 2021 which  focused on raising awareness of the value, importance and uniqueness of Ireland&rsquo;s archaeological heritage together with conveying the key messages for appropriate visitor behaviour at vulnerable heritage sites to ensure their survival in the landscape so that they can be enjoyed by present and future generations.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that only one of the cairns at Loughcrew is in State ownership and that is accessible to the public at all times.  This is one of the largest tombs in the complex and it is aligned to sunrise at the Spring and Autumn equinoxes and at these times people gather there to see the first rays of the sun.  The monument attracted in excess of 28,000 visitors in 2019, but like many such sites, visitor numbers were negatively impacted by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.</p></reply>

This funding is targeted at delivering timely access to acute hospital services which is a key goal of Sl&aacute;intecare and the funding is used to improve access to services and reduce waiting times for patients. The level of expenditure on the NTPF has increased over the last five years, with average year-on-year increases of around &euro;25 million since 2018 including once-off funding.</p>  <p>  The overall allocation for the Department of Health for 2022 is over &euro;22 billion and this allocation has been provided to significantly increase capacity with more hospital and community care beds and additional doctors, nurses and consultants. Budget 2022 provides further resources to drive the strategic reform of the health system in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  Any future allocation for the National Treatment Purchase Fund will be subject to engagement as part of the Estimates process as is standard practice for expenditure programmes.</p></reply>

This figure suggests that the site already attracts a significant number of visitors and is operating close to, or at, what would be considered a sustainable carrying capacity. </p>  <p>  The OPW is aware that at peak times, there are operational challenges which impact both on the monument site itself and on the surrounding area. While Tara is perceived by many as a local site for amenity, it is also a very sensitive archaeological site which is already at a maximum carrying capacity in terms of the number of visitors annually.  The OPW therefore will not be seeking to intentionally grow the numbers of visitors at Tara but rather, will be seeking to improve the sustainable management of the numbers already visiting, enhance the visitor experience, promote greater knowledge of the significance of Tara and careful manage any additional numbers that will likely arise in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  OPW is working closely with colleagues in the National Monuments Service at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Meath County Council in finalising a new Conservation Management Plan for Tara. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Objectives of the plan are:</p>  <p>  Objective 1: to protect and conserve the heritage of the State-owned lands on the Hill of Tara and sustain its cultural significance, integrity and authenticity </p>  <p>  Objective 2: to promote awareness and understanding of the Hill of Tara and its significance</p>  <p>  Objective 3: to manage and enhance the visitor experience on the Hill of Tara </p>  <p>  Objective 4: to implement the Tara Conservation Management Plan</p>  <p>  The OPW will continue to work closely with stakeholders to ensure that Tara, and all OPW-managed heritage sites in Meath, play their part in the local tourism and economic agendas but to also ensure that the extraordinarily rich heritage of Tara is careful protected and presented to the highest standards for the enjoyment of Irish citizens and international visitors alike.  </p></reply>

The renewed NDP has a particular focus on the all-of-Government priorities of housing and climate action ambitions, as well as to support other national strategic objectives as set out in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  The NDP is the largest in the history of the State. Our annual capital investment budget is now among the largest among EU countries. 2022 will be pivotal in consolidating the progress already made, and, most importantly, delivering the infrastructure to support our future climate, social and economic requirements. This year almost &euro;12 billion is available to spend on vital infrastructure in areas such as housing, transport, education, enterprise, sport and climate action.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I am responsible for setting the overall capital allocations across Departments and for monitoring monthly expenditure at Departmental level.  The responsibility for the management and delivery of the individual investment projects, within the allocations agreed under the NDP, rests with the individual sponsoring Department in each case. </p>  <p>  The NDP includes indicative Exchequer allocations for each Department for a five year period (2021 to 2025) and overall capital expenditure ceilings out to 2030. This expenditure is aimed at supporting the delivery of the ten National Strategic Outcomes (NSOs) identified in the National Planning Framework (NPF), which sets the overarching spatial strategy for the next two decades.  </p>  <p>  As the NDP is a high-level financial and budgetary framework it does not outline a comprehensive list of all the public investment projects that will take place over the next ten years, including 2022. For an extensive list of projects that are currently planned as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Deputy might consider the publications that were published alongside the NDP in October 2021, particularly the updated Investment tracker which is available at gov.ie/2040. The tracker provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments with an estimated cost of greater than &euro;20 million, including the location of the projects where possible. </p></reply>

We discussed the extremely concerning situation in Ukraine which has deteriorated significantly since our meeting.  Ireland stands with our EU partners in making clear that there can be no compromise on Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  The invasion by Russia of Ukraine and its attack on its people, is an outrageous and immoral breach of the most fundamental and basic principles of international law.</p>  <p>  The Chancellor and I discussed bilateral relations between our two countries.  Ireland and Germany are old and close friends, and relations between us are growing stronger all the time.</p>  <p>  The Chancellor and I also discussed a number of issues on the European Council&rsquo;s agenda, including economic recovery and investment.  Our Governments share a high level of ambition on climate action, and we both support the EU&rsquo;s climate goals for 2030 and beyond. </p>  <p>I also took the opportunity to brief Chancellor Scholz on the difficult political situation in Northern Ireland, and the importance of ensuring a period of calm ahead of the Assembly elections in May.</p></reply>

The table attached shows the number of publicly announced investments won in each of the years 2020 and 2021. It should be noted that not all companies agree to announce their investments and as a result, the table does not truly reflect the level of investments won or the performance of FDI in a particular year.</p><p>Jobs announced are typically created over a period of between 3 and 5 years depending on the company&rsquo;s business plan.</p><p>There are a number of established clusters in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s multinational client base located in regions throughout Ireland. These include Life Sciences, Technology, International Financial Services, Global Business Services, and Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies.</p><p>IDA is working closely with my Department, Enterprise Ireland and SFI to support the development of further clusters that align with national priorities, enterprise strengths and transformative areas of opportunity. </p><p>In addition, IDA has supported the development of NIBRT (National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training) and most recently the establishment of the new AMC (Advanced Manufacturing Centre). Both of these will advance sectoral developments across life sciences, tech, engineering and national expertise in new advanced manufacturing areas, supporting exports and the growth of high-end, challenging jobs in Ireland.</p><p>The development of a National Clustering Policy and Framework is currently underway and due for completion in Q2 2022, the aim of which is to develop a cohesive approach to clustering and its role in Enterprise Policy and to maximise the potential of clustering as a driver of enterprise development. This work will also aim to formalise a working definition of a recognised industry cluster. </p><p>Clustering is a strategic focus for both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as a mechanism to promote balanced regional growth and to strengthen enterprise linkages and spillovers. Recent supports for clustering include the Regional Technology Clustering Fund (RTCF) linking enterprise and regionally based Institute of Technology (IoTs)/ Technical Universities (TUs), the incentivisation of regional industry-led clusters through the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF).</p><p>The RTCF aims to build sectoral clusters of Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to drive productivity and competitiveness in and across regions through encouraging engagement between, enterprise and regionally based knowledge providers, such as the IoT&rsquo;s / TU&rsquo;s. RTCF-funded clustering initiatives are detailed in Table 1 attached. </p><p>The Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) is aimed at accelerating economic recovery in all regions of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional enterprise strengths. Its objective is to support significant regional initiatives to build on sectoral strengths, better leverage identified resources to improve enterprise capability, drive employment and enterprise development and stimulate enterprise clustering initiatives. Each of the three REDF calls included a stream to support industry clustering to stimulate innovative activity through promotion, sharing of facilities and exchange of knowledge and expertise.  Nine projects in total across the three calls of the REDF were approved funding under those specific streams. There was one cluster focused project under the Border Enterprise Development Fund. These projects are detailed in Table 2 attached.</p><p>Other clustering initiatives funded outside of these programmes include Cyber Ireland, a National Cyber Security Cluster and Geoscience Ireland which focuses on the internationalisation of indigenous businesses. <table>    <tr>       <th>Project</th>       <th>Location</th>       <th>Project summary</th>       <th>Fund </th>       <th>Approved Grant</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>BPO Cluster Ireland CLG</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>Project to support the further development of an indigenous Business Process Outsourcers cluster to support scaling and employment growth in the sector.</td>       <td>REDF</td>       <td><div>&euro;155,064</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>REDF (Call 1)</td>       <td><div>&euro;250,000</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Emerald Aero Cluster</td>       <td>Mid-West (Limerick)</td>       <td>Establishment of an Aerospace Manufacturing Cluster for the Mid-West.</td>       <td>REDF (Call 3)</td>       <td><div>&euro;350,560</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>REDF (Call 1)</td>       <td><div>&euro;209,844</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IT@Cork</td>       <td>South West (Cork)</td>       <td>Hiring of a cluster manager to work with IT@Cork's member companies to foster collaboration between companies and organisations.</td>       <td>RETS</td>       <td><div>&euro;91,200</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KerrySciTech</td>       <td>South West (Kerry)</td>       <td>Develop KerrySciTech as a cluster for growth of science and technology jobs in Kerry</td>       <td>REDF (Call 1)</td>       <td><div>&euro;236,500</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CIT Consortium Projects DAC</td>       <td>South West (Cork/Kerry)</td>       <td>Increase the number of start-ups coming from the undergraduate population of the three 3rd level college in the South West.</td>       <td>REDF (Call 2)</td>       <td><div>&euro;336,360</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Crystal Valley Tech DAC</td>       <td>South East (Waterford)</td>       <td>ICT Industry Cluster.

In order to increase the agility and responsiveness of the system, the Review recommended that new legislation be initiated.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Review found that there is a clear role for time limited work permissions for seasonal contracts for typically 6-9 months, and that there is a demand for such a permit type for lower skilled workers. To meet that demand, the development of a seasonal employment permit is underway, to provide for a non-EEA national to work in the State temporarily while retaining a legal domicile in a third country, for the purposes of employment in a sector of seasonal activity.</p>  <p>  The Employment Permits (Consolidation and Amendment) Bill sets out to consolidate the existing legislation to make a more accessible statutory basis for our economic migration system and to increase its agility and responsiveness.

It was created to make recommendations on how more women can be involved in decision-making at the top level of businesses in Ireland. The Review Group examines the gender mix within the governance and senior management of companies in Ireland and the issues which arise in connection with the appointment of company directors and senior management. They have set progressive targets to 2023 for the achievement of improved gender balance on the boards and senior management of these companies.</p><p>The Fourth Report of the Balance for Better Business Review Group was published on 13 December 2021. Important measures of progress noted in this report include:</p><p>- For all listed companies, as of 1 September 2021, 28% of directors are female, up from 14% in 2018</p><p>- ISEQ20 companies, at 31% female directors on average in September 2021, have exceeded the 2021 target (27%), a sizable improvement from 18% in 2018</p><p>- The 2021 target for female representation on boards of 27% (ISEQ20 companies) and 20% (other listed companies) has been met by 11 of the ISEQ20 boards and 10 of the other listed companies</p><p>- Of the 36 new board appointments made between September 2020 and September 2021, 15 (41%) of these appointments were female, up from 27% in September 2020</p><p>- Women on leadership teams of ISEQ20 companies increased from 16% in 2018 to 25% in September 2021, surpassing the 2021 target of 23%; and</p><p>- The gap between Ireland and the EU27 average for women on boards has continued to narrow, from 7.7 percentage points in 2018 to 0.9 percentage points 2021. Ireland is now ranked in 12<sup>th</sup>position, compared to 16<sup>th</sup>in 2018.</p><p>My Department, though its agency Enterprise Ireland, has been focused on increasing the number of women founding High Potential Start Ups (HPSUs). In 2011, only 7% of EI backed HPSUs included a female founder. By providing capability and funding supports specifically targeting women this had increased to over 21% by 2019.  </p><p>In January 2020, Enterprise Ireland launched its new six-year strategy for Women in Business including a detailed Action Plan. The aim of the strategy is to drive Ireland&rsquo;s economic success by harnessing the full talent and expertise of a diverse population. The Women in Business strategy includes four Key Objectives:</p><p>1. Increasing the number of women becoming entrepreneurs </p><p>2. Increasing the number of women starting High Potential Start Ups </p><p>3. Increasing the number of women led businesses that are trading internationally and </p><p>4. Increasing the number of women in senior leadership and decision-making roles inIrish companies.</p><p>This long-term approach is underpinned by the inclusion, for the first time ever, of a focus on increasing the number of women in management and leadership positions in Irish companies. Progress has been made in implementing the actions in the 2020 strategy including:</p><p>- a dedicated &euro;1m fundingstream for woman entrepreneurs under the Competitive Start Fundprogramme.  </p><p>- 75% of Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital investment funds supported by Enterprise Ireland have a womanat partner/investment manager level.</p><p>- The Level Project, www.levelproject.ie launched in November 2021 is a toolkit free to allcompanies, helping them assess their current situationand put in place practical actions to enhance gender balance in theirsenior teams.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices also promote National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day, which takes place in autumn each year. Last year due to COVID-19, it took place exclusively online, with the theme of &ldquo;Build the Future&rdquo;.  The event attracted over 1,000 attendees.</p><p>Under the National Digital Strategy, my Department is committed to continuing to increase the number of women-led start-ups and the number of women in leadership roles in digital companies. Under the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy, we have also stated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to achieving improved gender balance in AI.</p><p>The impacts and dynamics of trade from a gender lens are important issues for Ireland.  My Department supports the continued implementation of the Buenos Aires Declaration on trade and women&rsquo;s economic empowerment from the &ldquo;MC11&rdquo; WTO Ministerial Conference in 2017, welcomes the finalised Joint Ministerial Declaration on the advancement of gender equality and women&rsquo;s economic empowerment within trade for the &ldquo;MC12&rdquo; WTO Ministerial Conference and looks forward to its launch.  </p></reply>

url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100073#WRE01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 137 and 138 together.</p><p>The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages, in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.  The system is managed through the use of lists designating highly skilled and ineligible occupations.</p><p>Since March 2020, the Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment.  Indeed, Ireland was one of the few countries which managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis.</p><p>From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.</p><p>The Department has experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications. </p><p>The Department issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 at the end of January 2022.</p><p>In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits, following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists, that I announced at the end of October has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.  </p><p>Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack, when employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods. </p><p>Cognisant of the significant impact the pandemic has had on the Hospitality Sector, when the sector reopened in July, the Department committed to prioritise the processing of chef employment permit applications received in the processing queue at that time, in order to support the sector.  </p><p>The Department recognises the impact of current delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and has developed a plan of action to bring down the processing backlog built up over the pandemic.  The plan includes both additional staffing and systemic changes.  Staffing actions include recruitment of additional permanent and temporary staff.  In late November 2021 approval was granted to increase our permanent processing capacity by 69% and to increase overall capacity to 125% when temporary staff are included.  On 2 February 2022 further additional approval was granted to increase permanent processing capacity by 125% and increase overall capacity by 225% from the original early base in early November.  When all recruitment is completed, the team will be three and a quarter times the size it was in early November.  There has also been an increase in overtime and the temporary reassignment of staff from other areas of the Department with relevant skills.</p><p>As the plan of action is fully implemented it is expected that there will be positive progress achieved in reducing the backlog by the end of Q1 with it substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.  This should see a return to more normal processing timeframes.  </p><p>In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.  The Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.  A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.  This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period.</p><p>The Employment Permits Section of my Department are currently processing standard applications received on 4 October 2021 and Trusted Partner applications received on 11 November 2021.</p><p>Applicants can keep track of Employment Permit applications current processing dates at </p><p>My Department engages directly with key stakeholders including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups and individual companies, in addition to issuing updates on relevant employment permit matters through the Employment Permits Trusted Partners network.

However, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.</p><p>The table below details the number of IDA in person visits for counties Galway, Clare and Limerick in 2019 the number of in person and e-Site visits for counties Galway, Clare and Limerick in 2020 and 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2021 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2019 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway  </td>       <td>31 </td>       <td>21 </td>       <td>46 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>37 </td>       <td>26 </td>       <td>57 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare  </td>       <td>20 </td>       <td>16 </td>       <td>28 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In response to COVID, IDA migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms during 2020. IDA Ireland has developed a suite of digital content which can be accessed by potential investors.  The Agency has developed this further and has put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors.  The use of digital platforms by IDA staff has contributed to an enhanced digital engagement with existing clients and also in hosting E-Site visits, with potential new investors.  As with in person visits, a number of locations can be marketed within an e-visit.</p><p>I am assured that IDA will return to hosting in person site visits in line with all public health guidelines and continue to position all counties, including Galway, Clare and Limerick, for these into 2022 and beyond.</p><p>Regional development is at the centre of IDA&rsquo;s strategy, Driving Recovery &amp;amp; Sustainable Growth 2021-2024. IDA is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. IDA will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country.</p></reply>

The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme has been developed in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework.  It has been approved by the European Commission on the basis that it will be used by viable businesses for working capital/liquidity requirements and investment purposes to meet the challenge of a changed working environment arising from COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  While a loan application for purposes of financing real estate is ineligible under the CCGS, it is a matter for the lending institution as to whether it would consider such an application outside of the CCGS.</p></reply>

In order to improve traceability of waste received and to counter the trade in stolen metal, an amendment to the Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) Regulations was introduced in 2014 to require the following at all permitted facilities receiving/purchasing waste:  - the production of proof of identity and current address for the person supplying the material;</p>  <p>  - records to be kept of the registration number and waste collection permit number of the delivery vehicle;</p>  <p>  - records to be kept describing the materials, time and date of sale, weight and amount paid; and</p>  <p>  - the provision of a signed statement by the person supplying the material indicating that they are the lawful owner.</p>  <p>  The Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) have issued guidance to all waste facility permit holders, including Authorised Treatment Facilities (ATFs) for end-of-life vehicles, advising them of their responsibilities and local authorities continue to undertake inspections to ensure compliance with the regulations.

This is an exceptional measure which uses the single eligibility criterion of a meter point registration number (MPRN), to ensure payments to each domestic electricity account as early as possible in 2022 using the existing electricity billing infrastructure. The payment will be applied to the domestic electricity account rather than an individual. Therefore the scheme is without application or further qualifying criteria.The scheme will also include pre-pay customers.</p>  <p>  Domestic premises, which are connected to the electricity grid and so have an MPRN assigned, and have a micro-generation system installed, will have the payment credited to the electricity account associated with that MPRN.

The Government recently approved a package of significantly improved supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and lower emissions. The supports include a new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the previous level of 30-35%). </p>  <p>  When a homeowner is completing a whole home energy upgrade, windows and doors form part of the overall fabric and are assessed through the home energy survey and assessment. The assessment may therefore recommend upgrading to ensure that home achieves a B2 rating or is suitable for installation of a heat pump, and in these situations that windows and doors are eligible for support through the One Stop Shop service. </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is recommended that homeowners considering a window upgrade should consider a whole home energy upgrade to determine the best measures to achieve a warm and comfortable home. Similarly, homeowners can receive support for upgrading windows and doors as part of a Community Energy Grant project &ndash; where the upgrade also addresses the whole home. The provision of grants for windows and doors, as part of a whole home energy upgrade, represents a continuation of the approach adopted previously as opposed to any change in policy.</p>  <p>  In the Warmer Homes Scheme, poorest performing homes are upgraded and in certain circumstances windows may be recommended following a survey and provided where suitable. They are not offered as an individual energy upgrade but as part of a suite of upgrades to provide a warm and comfortable home for the homeowners in an economic and efficient way.</p></reply>

This Bill is currently before the Houses, with a view to the scheme becoming operational by the end of Quarter 1. This scheme is in addition to the Government&rsquo;s ongoing measures to address energy poverty and the protection of vulnerable customers, and is in addition to the measures introduced in the Budget.The scheme will apply to all domestic accounts and will include pre-pay customers.The mechanism by which pay as you go customers will receive the credit is currently being finalised in discussions between the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU), ESB Networks and suppliers. The CRU has indicated that it is expected that this would happen by way of the credit being applied towards the account of the pay as you go customer, who would then receive the credit when they vend for credit. My Department is engaging closely with the CRU on this matter, and will continue to do so.The Deputy may also wish to note that regular information updates, including frequently asked questions, are being made available on gov.ie at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/4ae14-electricity-costs-emergency-benefit-scheme/.</p></reply>

It will also facilitate the achievement of the goal of generateing up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.    The option of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions. Most recently, the key finding from the International Expert Commission's report of October 2018 was that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this critical electricity infrastructure.</p>  <p>Notwithstanding this, I decided to commission a further short review to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remains valid.

The scheme will also include pre-pay customers. </p><p>The type of coin operated meters referred to by the Deputy are not installed by ESB Networks (ESBN) and are not regulated by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU). I understand that such devices are usually installed behind the electricity meter, and their use for payment of electricity is a contractual matter between residents and their landlords or the operators of mobile home parks. </p><p>While the majority of tenants will hold their own domestic electricity accounts, and therefore receive the payments directly, others would have tenancy agreements where tenants pay their actual share of each bill and, in those cases, will benefit from the payment because the amount of the bill will be reduced by the amount of the payment. </p><p>A small proportion would have other arrangements in place whereby electricity costs are part of the rental cost. With the support of the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage, my Department is working closely with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) on a public information campaign to ensure that all tenants are aware of the scheme. Disputes relating to tenancies including any terms relating to electricity payments can be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for dispute resolution.</p></reply>

The Plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key areas: driving demand and activity; financing and funding; supply chain, skills and standards; and governance.    In line with commitments in the Plan, the Government recently approved a package of significantly enhanced supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades. The new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme will provide increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard. A network of One Stop Shops will offer a new end-to-end project management service for homeowners. This includes surveying the home; designing the upgrades; managing the grant processes; helping with access to finance; engaging the contractors to deliver the work and then quality-assuring that work.</p>  <p>  In addition, increased grants for attic and cavity wall insulation have also been made available, covering 80% of the cost to homeowners of these highly cost-effective upgrade measures. Free upgrades are available for households at risk of energy poverty. My Department is also developing a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme which will enable financial institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates for retrofit projects. </p>  <p>In light of the foregoing, an additional funding model such as that used for the fair deal scheme was not considered in the context of these recent changes.   </p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 143,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme. In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased to &euro;17,100.</p><p>There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are:</p><p>-  Awaiting the initial survey of their home;</p><p>-  Have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor;</p><p>-  Have been allocated to a contractor for works; or,</p><p>-  Currently undergoing works. </p><p>Activity under the Scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2021, the average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 26 months. While this delay was largely driven by COVID related issues, the deeper measures being provided under the scheme since 2018, also involve more substantive works. </p><p>In order to reduce this timeline to completion, the following key actions are being taken:</p><p>-  The budget, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;</p><p>-  The number of homes retrofitted under the scheme are due to increase from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month in 2022;</p><p>-  SEAI has allocated additional staff for the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme;</p><p>-  SEAI is working to increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management. </p><p>Works under the Scheme recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector and activity did ramp up again towards the end of last year. Based on the foregoing, SEAI target clearing the homes currently on the waiting list in approximately 18 months. The status of individual applications is an operational matter for SEAI and they have established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members in this regard; oireachtas@seai.ie.</p></reply>

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of 18 February, almost 303,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 157,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and almost 55,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 22 counties. In County Cork surveying is underway in the Deployment Area of Clonakilty, surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Templemartin, Tallow, Kanturk and Fermoy, main works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Midleton and Youghal and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Carrigaline.  To date over 35,000 premises in County Cork have been surveyed, with over 10,500 premises under construction and over 4,500 premises now available to order. With regard to  Rockchapel, the premises located within the Intervention Area are covered by the Meelin Deployment Area and will be delivered with high speed broadband as part of the NBP, ensuring the premises will not be left behind.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 18 February 2022, 493 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork 22 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date including Glash Community Centre which is approximately 9km from the Rockchapel area. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>In County Cork 15 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area.

I am advised by IFI that despite ecological pressures, the river Liffey remains one of only a handful of rivers in European Capitals through which a self-sustaining population of Atlantic salmon actively migrate.        IFI have also advised that they initiated a large scale River Liffey Catchment fish population survey during Summer 2021 mobilising a cross-agency response to concerns expressed by local angling groups. IFI are currently analysing these data for compilation in a report which will be publicly available during 2022. A review of the the report referred to by the Deputy - &lsquo;Fisheries Assessment of the River Liffey, County Kildare (December 2021)&rsquo; - is underway at IFI. </p>  <p>  Reviewing both sets of data is an operational matter for IFI and I and my Department have no role in this matter.

Energy poverty is influenced by a person&rsquo;s income, the energy efficiency of their home and the cost of the energy they use. Recent measurements of the share of households likely to be experiencing energy poverty include:</p>  <p>  -  In 2019 and 2020 the Economic and Social Research Institute assessed the number of households likely to be spending more than 10% of their income on energy needed. In the 2020 analysis, this was estimated to be 17.5% of households;</p>  <p>  -  The Survey of Income and Living Conditions is carried out annually by the CSO and gives an indication of the number of households experiencing difficulty in keeping their homes warm. In the most recent survey results (for 2020, published in 2021), the proportion of people who reported that they were unable to afford to keep their home adequately warm was 3.4%. </p>  <p>  A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute has been established to examine the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland. The group consists of representatives from my Department, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office.</p>  <p>  The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to alleviate fuel and energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits.These supports are available nationwide and are linked to a household&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  In addition, a payment of &euro;200 (inclusive of VAT) will be paid to all domestic electricity accounts as part of the Government&rsquo;s package of measures to provide further support to households in the context of increased living costs.</p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. Commercial operators have indicated their plans to supply Gigabit services to all premises in the BLUE area of the NBP Map by 2026.  Under State aid rules, my Department is not permitted to displace commercial investment by intervening in areas where commercial investment exists or is planned, as to do so would be an infringement of these State aid rules. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard. </p>  <p>  Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to ensure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p></reply>

It is important to note that activity under the Scheme in 2020 and 2021 was significantly impacted by COVID-related restrictions on the construction sector which led to a large increase in the number of homes awaiting works. Addressing wait times is a key priority for my Department and the SEAI.  The 2022 budget for the Scheme, at &euro;109 million, will support an increase in the number of homes retrofitted from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month (or a total of 4,800) this year. This greatly increased level of activity will enable the homes currently on the waiting list to be cleared in approximately 18 months. In addition to the record capital allocation for the Scheme this year, I have also secured additional staffing resources for the SEAI including the Warmer Homes Scheme team.  Delivery capacity in the supply chain has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel established in late 2020. The SEAI continues to work with the scheme contractors on an ongoing basis to further increase output. </p></reply>

The UK&rsquo;s gas supply comes mainly from indigenous supplies, via pipeline from Norway and through imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).  In addition, the UK can also import via two gas interconnectors connecting the UK to Belgium and the Netherlands. Both the UK and Ireland both have far less reliance on Russian gas than other European Countries.   The European Commission is a working closely with Member States to protect the resilience of  Europe&rsquo;s gas security of supply and the Commission is also actively engaging with other countries to ensure sufficient and timely supply of natural gas to the EU from diverse sources across the globe to avoid supply shocks, including those that could result from disruptions. </p>  <p>  Any disruption of Russian gas supplies would maintain upward pressure on European gas prices, with knock-on effects on electricity prices. In the unlikely event of any gas supply emergency, there is excellent cooperation between Irish and UK gas system operators &ndash; to maintain security of gas supplies from the UK. This cooperation includes regular testing of emergency plans by the operators. </p>  <p>Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) is the designated National Gas Emergency Manager appointed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.

Through bye-laws, these local authorities set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations. It is under Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 that local authorities are provided with power in respect of making bye-laws.  Local Government legislation comes within the ambit of my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  In most counties, there seems to have been little demand and bye-laws are not in place. In other areas, the matter is more relevant.  For example, in Kerry, where there is a long tradition of jarvey operation, bye-laws have been adopted to regulate the operation of these horse-drawn hackney carriages. </p>  <p>  Unlike other local authorities in the country, Dublin City Council lacks the power to regulate and set standards for horse-drawn carriages.  My Department is working with relevant stakeholders in developing an appropriate regulatory framework for this area. This work includes the consideration of how best to safely repeal the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55, which currently vests the power to regulate horse-drawn carriages in Dublin with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the successor.  Work on this issue unfortunately did not progress as planned in the last two years due to the need to prioritise work in other areas, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic but is once again progressing.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 50,500 now. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is available online. In line with the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to support the transition to EVs:</p>  <p>  -  The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland has been retained until at least end-2022. Work is ongoing to identify additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles. Overall, cost-effective, targeted policy supports will continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and   </p>  <p>  -  Work is underway to establish An Office for Low Emission Vehicles, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-01a.403.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100076#WRH03700"><p>I thank the deputy for the opportunity to set out, in brief, some of the achievements made by my department in the area of equality and inclusion, specifically in relation to women, over recent times.</p><p><b>Intersectional Policy Initiatives</b></p><p>My Department worked closely with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) on the development and implementation of its Public Sector Duty Assessment and Action Plan. This is an ongoing duty that my department monitors, reviews, and develops continuously.  My department also participates on several equality interdepartmental groups including the National Strategy for Women &amp;amp; Girls (NSWG).</p><p><b>Equality Budgeting</b></p><p>In 2021, the Department of Transport introduced a dedicated equality budgeting spending line in the budget alongside dedicated performance indicators in keeping with the current Programme for Government commitment to expand the Equality Budgeting Programme across government departments and agencies. By examining budgeting and expenditure from an equality perspective, the Department is better placed to identify gaps or bias in expenditure that can cause or maintain disadvantage, or fail to promote equal access to transport and related services.</p><p><b>Gender Balance on State Boards</b></p><p>Across the 18 State Boards under the remit of the Department of Transport, the gender balance is currently 68% male and 32% female. I actively encourage applications from as wide and diverse a pool of candidates as possible and am acutely aware of the need to meet a 40% gender target.  I am committed to promoting diversity and inclusion on the State Boards under my remit, and to widen access to a broader range of experiences, perspectives, and skillsets.  Ahead of International Women&rsquo;s Day, my department is hosting a webinar this week to promote the benefits of gender balance, diversity, and inclusion on its State Boards. Both I and my colleague, Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton will be participating in this event.</p><p><b>Public Transport Services</b></p><p>Transport is often seen as gender-neutral, providing benefit to all equally. However, a growing body of international research highlights that this is not the case. Women and men can have different needs, constraints, and expectations for using transport. In 2020, Transport Infrastructure Ireland carried out a women in travel survey &ndash; &lsquo;Travelling in a Woman&rsquo;s Shoes&rsquo;. The report sheds light on the disparities and realities that women face every day in order to understand the different mobility patterns and needs of both women and men.</p><p>Capturing gender information in transport surveys is key to understanding the needs of everyone and ensuring everyone feels safe while travelling. The department has utilised CSO and Census data to analyse the age and gender of public transport users in the development of its Sustainability Mobility Policy, which is due to be launched shortly.</p><p>Accessible public transport provides greater opportunities for all members of society, and especially those who may be in vulnerable situations - women, persons with disabilities, older people - to access essential services, such as employment, education, training, and health services.</p><p>My department delivers its commitments towards making public transport accessible for all via its Accessibility Work Programme which provides the framework for prioritising projects and programmes to progressively make public transport accessible.  The department&rsquo;s Accessibility Consultative Committee (ACC) monitors progress on the Work Programme. The ACC gender balance is currently 75% female and 25% male.</p><p>In addition to the above, the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility plan, which is a major national public transport initiative developed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) to increase public transport connectivity, particularly for people living outside the major cities and towns, will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services right across the country. </p><p>In the context of services to rural areas, Local Link public transport services prioritise the reduction of social exclusion across all demographics. As well as combatting rural isolation, the vast majority of Local Link services are door-to-door community type services, which enable women in rural areas to access work, education and training services.</p><p><b>Cycling</b></p><p>In 2019, a Bike Life Dublin Metropolitan Area report was produced by Sustrans in partnership with the National Transport Authority (NTA) with gender being a key part of the data collected and presented in the report. There is evidence from the census that there is a significant gender-gap with regard to those cycling, with only one in every 250 girls cycling to school in the country.  The Green Schools initiative funded by the NTA, working with teenage girls, has developed #andshecyclescampaign to look at addressing this issue.</p><p><b>Employment Equality in the Transport Sector</b></p><p>The need to increase the number of women employed in the transport sector is something that my department and its agencies are very aware of. Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and Bus Eireann all share an ongoing commitment to maintaining a diverse, inclusive and balanced workforce, and have a number of regular initiatives in this regard</p><p>Regarding diversity and inclusion in the aviation and maritime sectors, the Department has committed to supporting research by Dublin City University on building gender balance within the aviation industry.  To support greater inclusion of women in the maritime sector, the National Maritime College Ireland (NMCI), which is Ireland&rsquo;s designated centre for the education and training of personnel for the Merchant Marine, organises annual events to coincide with International Women&rsquo;s Day designed to encourage women to apply for the various maritime course offered by NMCI.  My Department is the regulatory authority for approving NMCI courses. </p><p>As the Deputy will see from the foregoing, my Department is fully committed to making progress on equality objectives for women. </p></reply>

The intention of this permit is to provide access to parking bays of sufficient size in close proximity to important services such as post offices, banks, pharmacies and shops. The scheme is for people for whom access to such services, because of their limited mobility, would be denied if they could not park and disembark, either because of the size of a parking bay or because they could not park within a short distance of a service.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise to the Deputy that issuing a large number of extra permits, either by extending the eligibility criteria to include autism, or by introducing an autism-specific scheme, would put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and compromise the availability of accessible parking spaces for people with significantly restricted mobility.</p></reply>

It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.</p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day. A further &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. The NTA will work with the PSO public transport operators in the coming weeks to commence rolling out these fare reductions across the public transport network in April/May. </p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the inclusion of commercial bus operators in the schemes, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published for consultation early this year.</p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. </p>  <p>  The Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government which will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through the supports for on street chargers. I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf.</p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund (CAF) to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles - 17 high power chargers distributed across 14 multi vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.  The installation of high powered charging hubs will be the priority for the remainder of the program.</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.  ESB are awaiting the delivery of new chargers which have twice the charging capacity and speed when compared to the existing technology.  This element of the programme will restart when the units are delivered and conclude in Q3.</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete, 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p>  <p>  The project is due to be completed in 2023.  </p>  <p>  Further details on ESB charge points nationwide can be found at esb.ie/ecars/charge-point-map.</p>  <p>  In light of the ESB eCars responsibility in the matter of the provision of charge points, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the ESB for direct response.  Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days. </p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.</p><p>In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (24 February) by EWSS is over &euro;7.5 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;6.51 billion and PRSI forgone of over &euro;1 billion to 51,900 employers in respect of over 717,300 employees. In relation to TWSS, in total &euro;2.8 billion was paid to over 67,000 employers in respect of almost 690,000 employees.  Overall to-date, support well in excess of &euro;10 billion has been provided across the two wage subsidy schemes. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the amount of support provided to the childcare sector from March 2020 to January 2022 (the latest month for which data are available) through the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) amounts to approximately &euro;677m. The breakdown by scheme and year is set out in the table below. These estimates are based on childcare providers registered with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2020 &euro;m </th>       <th>2021 &euro;m </th>       <th>2022 (Jan) &euro;m </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EWSS </td>       <td>116 </td>       <td>399 </td>       <td>32 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TWSS </td>       <td>130 </td>       <td>NA </td>       <td>NA </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS. </p><p>Since the introduction of EWSS there has been regular and, where necessary, detailed engagement between my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (D/CEDIY). Analysis undertaken by D/CEDIY informed the approach taken with regard to the childcare sector. Childcare business will continue to benefit from the EWSS exemption until end April 2022.</p><p>As announced by my colleague, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman, it is intended to put in place a transition fund between May and August 2022, which early learning and childcare providers can access. From September 2022, a major new funding stream will be introduced, to support providers in meeting their operating costs in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase.</p></reply>

Analysis undertaken using SWITCH, the ESRI tax and benefit model, to simulate the impact of the carbon tax increase and the compensatory welfare package has confirmed that the net impact of the combined measures is progressive.  Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off as a result of these measures.</p><p>In addition to the Budget 2022 measures announced in October 2021, in February this year the Government approved a further package of measures to the value of &euro;505m to mitigate the cost of living including an increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households.  The package also included a series of targeted measures which will reduce the impact of inflation including ; </p><p>&mdash;a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance will be paid to 390,000 recipients;</p><p>&mdash;a temporary reduction in public transport fares of 20% from the end of April to the end of the year. This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Go Ahead, Luas, DART and Local Link services;</p><p>&mdash;a reduction of the Drug Payment Scheme from &euro;144 to &euro;80. This will benefit just over 70,000 families</p><p>&mdash;the working family payment budget increase will be brought forward from 1 June to 1 April;</p><p>&mdash;reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children;</p><p>Carbon Tax is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050.  The Programme for Government commits that all revenues raised from additional increases in Carbon Tax will be used for:</p><p>-  Targeted social welfare measures to prevent fuel poverty and ensure a just transition;</p><p>-  To part fund a socially progressive national retrofitting programme;</p><p>-  To encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way.</p><p>It is revenue from carbon tax that will support Ireland in meeting our climate targets in the short and medium terms by protecting against fuel poverty, and in the long term by providing for a more sustainable living environment. In the long run the best way to protect Ireland from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them. We will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish Society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government 2020 outlined a commitment to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The need to make significant emissions reductions in the transport sector is fundamental to Ireland&rsquo;s policy around Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and Motor Tax; the systems are designed to facilitate the uptake of EVs and to address the increasingly harmful environmental and public health effects of vehicle emissions. </p>  <p>  Vehicles registered after July 2008 are charged motor tax according to their emissions profile; the rate for EVs is &euro;120 and scales up to &euro;2400 for the most pollutant vehicles. The VRT system has been modified in recent Budgets to strengthen the environmental rationale of the regime, and is structured to provide a reduced rate for EVs of 7% of open-market selling price (OMSP), while vehicles falling into the highest emissions band are liable to a rate of 41%. The &euro;5,000 VRT relief for electric cars and vans were due to end on 31st December 2021 but was extended for two years in Finance Act 2021 to end in 2023. As the rate of VRT charged for EVs is already very low, many purchased in the next two years will pay no VRT at all. </p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019 I legislated for a CO2-based benefit-in-kind (BIK) regime for company cars from 1/1/2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.</p>  <p>  The current &euro;50,000 BIK exemption was extended in Finance Act 2021 with a tapering mechanism that represents a value for money consideration.  This forms part of a broader series of generous measures including the preferential rates of VRT and Motor Tax, the VRT relief, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this Government continues to provide a generous set of supports to encourage the transition to low and zero emission vehicles.</p></reply>

A cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by the installations covered by the system. The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall.   Within the cap, installations receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. </p>  <p>  The Irish Carbon Tax is a national tax which is applied to mineral oils, solid fuels and natural gas.    In line with the Programme for Government policy approach to Carbon Tax, Finance Act 2020 legislated for a series of annual increments in the Carbon Tax rate leading to a rate of &euro;100 per tonne of tonne of CO2 emitted in 2030.   This trajectory of increases transparently signals to households and businesses the specific rate increases which they can expect to occur every year out to 2030, thereby affording a period of gradual transition.   </p>  <p>  The ETS, as a market based system applying to large installations, operates through an entirely different structure to the domestic carbon tax. While the ETS carbon price changes periodically, the rate of carbon tax is set out in the 2020 Finance Act. The Government remains committed to the carbon tax rates outlined in the Programme for Government and Finance Act.  </p></reply>

These patrol and monitoring activities are aimed at the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of illegal importations and exportations of prohibited and restricted goods, including drugs. It is also involved in servicing national and international Memoranda of Understanding and Mutual Assistance requests from other jurisdictions, and works closely with the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC-N), based in Lisbon, the focus of which is to reduce the threat of drug trafficking into the EU by sea.</p>  <p>  Revenue currently has two cutters (patrol vessels) in service, RCC Suirbh&eacute;ir and RCC Faire, I am informed that Revenue intends to purchase a replacement vessel for RCC Suirbh&eacute;ir, which is in operation since 2004 and is approaching the end of its service life. As part of the procurement process, Revenue published a Prior Information Notice (PIN) in the Official Journal of the EU in November 2021. The purpose of the PIN was to inform the market that Revenue may seek tenders in 2022 for the provision of a new cutter. It is anticipated that this procurement competition will also include an option for a second vessel which could be a future replacement for RCC Faire, which has been in operation since 2009. I am advised that Revenue is currently finalising the detailed specifications and requirements as regards any cutter which it may seek to acquire through the tender process.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should note that Revenue&rsquo;s capacity to carry out customs patrols is independent of the Naval Service. Questions relating to the Naval Service are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Programme for Government recognises the need for a continued focus on insurance reform in order to tackle the issue of costs, including of public liability insurance. This focus is being driven by the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, through the Action Plan for Insurance Reform.</p>  <p>  One of the key achievements of this whole-of-Government reform agenda has been the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, which have significantly lowered award levels of many common injuries. The Guidelines should also help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, thereby reinforcing the benefits of using the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) to settle claims, which in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that the benefit of the suite of reforms being pursued, including the Guidelines, are passed onto customers. In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has held two rounds of meetings with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in the Irish market, to discuss their response to the Action Plan, and we will both maintain a proactive engagement process throughout 2022 in order to hold industry to account in this regard. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Sub-Group has a number of key areas of focus for 2022, including actions relevant to public liability insurance, such as reforming the duty of care legislation. Rebalancing the duty of care should help to address the issue of slips, trips and falls, which are particularly prevalent in footfall-intensive areas, and should contribute to easing the insurance difficulties facing artists and performers. I will continue working with the Minister for Justice, who is leading on this action, and with colleagues across Government, in order to ensure that the overall implementation of the Action Plan leads to improved affordability of insurance for all sectors of the economy, including the arts.</p></reply>

The VAT Directive obliges each Member State to have a standard rate of VAT and also allows that a Member State may choose to have no more than two reduced rates of VAT, which may be no less than 5%, and which may be applied to certain goods and services:  any of those listed in Annex III of the Directive. Within this framework, Ireland currently applies a standard rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%. </p>  <p>  Also, within the EU Directive there is provision for derogations from the general rules which allows an individual Member State to continue certain historic tax treatments.  By way of special derogation from the general rule, Ireland maintains several standstill provisions and derogations, including the availability of either an exemption or application of the reduced rate of VAT of 9% to the promotion of and admissions to live musical performances (excluding dances) &ndash; the exact VAT treatment depends on whether food or drink is available for consumption.</p>  <p>  Under Irish VAT law the supply of services by writers, composers and performing artists are subject to the standard rate of VAT, currently 23%.  The providers of such services are required to register for VAT where their supplies exceed &euro;37,000 per annum, and &ndash; in line with normal VAT rules &ndash; if the recipients of the services are registered for VAT and use the supplies in the course of their taxable business activities, then the VAT charged on the supply is deductible by the recipient</p>  <p>  Under the VAT Directive, there is no provision to permit the introduction of an exemption or what the Deputy refers to as a &ldquo;super reduced&rdquo; rate to the supply of services by writers, composers or performers.  Member States may apply a reduced rate to such services;  however, any consideration of this possibility would need to assess the benefit of making such a change &ndash; given that the VAT charged on service supplied to a VAT-registered business is already deductible by the recipient of the supply, under the normal VAT rules.  </p>  <p>  Decisions about tax changes are generally taken in the context of the Budget and, as part of our normal annual Budget preparations, various options for tax policy changes will be considered by the Tax Strategy Group prior to Budget 2023.</p></reply>

As an employer, the Department must fulfil its obligations under equality legislation, particularly the Employment Equality Act 1998-2015.</p><p>The Employment Equality Act 1998-2015, outlaws discrimination in a wide range of employment and employment-related areas. These include recruitment and promotion; equal pay; working conditions; learning opportunities - whether on the job or formal training; dismissal and harassment including sexual harassment. </p><p>In 2015, the Civil Service published its revised Dignity at Work Policy, which was developed in partnership between the Civil Service Management and Staff Unions. The revised policy, which applies to staff of the Department of Finance, aims to promote respect, dignity, safety and equality in the workplace. The policy is brought to the attention of staff upon commencing employment in the Department and during the induction programme, that all forms of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment are unacceptable and every member of staff has a duty to behave in an acceptable and respectable manner. During the induction training staff are also given an overview of unconscious bias and they are encouraged to complete the Project Implicit Test (available at implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) to give them a better understanding of their own biases. </p><p>As part of the revised policy a new role of Designated Person and Contact person were introduced. The contact person is someone who is available to listen and provide information to a staff member who may be concerned regarding bullying, harassment and/or sexual harassment in the workplace.</p><p>In addition, the Civil Service Employee Assistance Service, CSEAS, is a neutral support service and provides a wide range of free and confidential supports to all employees of the Department.</p><p>During 2017 and 2018 the Department of Finance provided &lsquo;Being an Engaged Leader&rsquo; Programme (unconscious bias training) to staff of the Department with over 200 staff attending this training. In 2021 this training was expanded on through a new programme which built on the foundations of the initial training, called Diversity 3.0. To date 128 staff have completed the Diversity 3.0 training and more sessions are planned for 2022 in conjunction with eLearnings in the following areas:</p><p>-  Ethnic &amp;amp; Racial Diversity in the Workplace</p><p>-  Gender Diversity in the Workplace</p><p>-  LGBTQ+ Inclusion in the Workplace</p><p>-  Masculinity in the Workplace</p><p>-  Neurodiversity in the Workplace</p><p>-  The Multi-Generational Workplace</p><p><b>Recruitment</b></p><p>The standards for recruitment and selection for the Department/Civil Service are set by the Commission on Public Service Appointments (CPSA). The Public Appointments Service (PAS) is tasked with carrying out external requirements from Clerical Officer through to Principal Officer level, and PAS also administer any TLAC recruitment needs. It should be noted that recruitment is merit based and for external recruitment (i.e. open and interdepartmental) the Department has no choice on gender or otherwise of the candidates, as we are allocated the next candidate on the panel.</p><p><b>30% Club</b></p><p>To mark International Women&rsquo;s Day on Tuesday 8 March 2022, the Chair of the Irish Chapter of the 30% Club, will give a Power Hour presentation on the aims and work of the Club, all staff are invited to attend. </p><p>The club is a global campaign supported by Board Chairs and CEOs of medium and large organisations, committed to achieving better gender balance at leadership levels and throughout their organisation, for better business outcomes.</p><p>The aim of the 30% Club is to support the achievement of a minimum of 30% Gender Balance at all senior decision-making tables across Ireland, including Boards and c-Suite. They are business led, representing the needs of their supporter organisations and the daily workings of the group are managed by a volunteer panel representing a cross section of those organisations.</p></reply>

Under domestic legislation, professional medical care services recognised as such by the Department of Health are exempt from VAT. Professional medical care services recognised by the Department of Health are generally those medical care services supplied by health professionals who are enrolled, registered, regulated, or designated on the appropriate statutory register provided for under the relevant legislation in force in the State or equivalent legislation applicable in other countries.

A final stakeholder engagement session has been scheduled for early March. Legislative proposals arising will go to Cabinet shortly thereafter.</p><p>As part of the Review of the Policy Framework, Minister of State Fleming has conducted extensive stakeholder engagement, meeting with the representative bodies, collaborative ventures, service providers, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the Registrar of Credit Unions and individual credit unions. The information gained from these meetings will help inform the next steps taken by Government. </p><p>In terms of supporting the sector to provide essential financial services to local communities, the following are some recent developments which highlight the potential of the sector to grow and fulfil a role in relation to community banking.  </p><p><b>Lending and Investment</b></p><p>The Central Bank has in recent years reviewed both the lending and investment frameworks. Since 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to &euro;1.1 billion in additional SME and mortgage loans, with further capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. As of September 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;387 million, an increase of 19% year-on-year.  </p><p>Credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). I am pleased to share with the Deputy that three credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank. Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will subsequently lend to AHBs. </p><p><b>SME Lending </b></p><p>Nineteen credit unions were approved in early 2021 for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further, in November five credit unions were announced as participants in the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). The BILS provides low-cost loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m to eligible Brexit-impacted businesses. </p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 6.9% year on year to end September 2021.  Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book. </p><p><b>Access to Finance for Retrofit </b></p><p>The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit. My officials have been engaging with stakeholders to support increased credit union participation in retrofit loan schemes.  </p><p><b>Other Services</b></p><p>Other than member savings and lending, in order to provide &ldquo;additional services&rdquo;, a credit union must receive approval from the Central Bank.  </p><p>66 credit unions are approved to provide current accounts.  </p><p>The Central Bank has prescribed a list of exempt services which may be provided without requiring approval. The Central Bank is undertaking a review of the Exempt Services Schedule to ensure that the services listed reflect the current financial services landscape. The Central Bank has commenced a public consultation seeking views from stakeholders on the proposed changes arising from this review.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that that continues to be the position</p>  <p>  When section 865 was introduced, Revenue&rsquo;s general right to raise assessments or make enquiries in relation to taxpayer returns was also reduced to four years, although in certain circumstances, for example where fraud or neglect is suspected or in the context of the application of general anti-avoidance rules, Revenue's right to raise assessments or make enquiries is not time limited.  Previously, the general time limit on the raising of assessments by Revenue had been ten years. The provision of a four-year time limit for Revenue raising assessments and making enquiries and for taxpayers to claim a repayment of tax creates parity between both positions.  An increase in one limit would have to be considered in the context of corresponding increases in other time limits in order to preserve that parity.</p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to amend the four-year limit in section 865.</p></reply>

This process takes the equivalent Financial Action Task Force (FATF) lists as a starting point.  Other countries to be assessed and the order of priority for this assessment, are determined based on detailed criteria, including the status of the country&rsquo;s AML/CFT framework and its ties to the EU financial system. A key feature of this methodology is the engagement with a country prior to a decision on its listing, to allow it to remedy identified deficiencies. The Member States are consulted by the Commission during this process. I trust the Commission services to continue work according to this methodology and I do not wish to prejudge any process or decision which may be made in regard to any country.</p>  <p>  Switzerland is a fellow member of the FATF and is committed to upholding its Standards for AML/CFT policy. Switzerland performed well in its 2016 assessment by FATF, in which the country&rsquo;s framework was found to &lsquo;reflect the high risk level associated with the banking sector.&rsquo; Reviews by FATF are conducted by teams of unbiased AML/CFT experts from all over the world. I have full confidence in the impartiality and thoroughness of this process and the resulting assessment of banking regulators, or indeed any other AML/CFT authority.</p>  <p>  In terms of customer due diligence, I am informed by the Department of Justice that obligations in Ireland on all designated persons in the financial and non-financial sectors, in relation to customer due diligence to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, are set out in the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 as amended. These best practice obligations in relation to customer due diligence derive from the FATF Standards and EU obligations under the fourth and fifth anti money laundering Directives.  The Central Bank supervises designated financial institutions in the regulated financial sector to ensure compliance with the law. </p></reply>

The EFSM and EFSF loans formed part of the EU-IMF Programme 2010-2013. The SURE Programme loan was drawn down last year to assist in dealing with the employment impact of the pandemic. </p><p>The other Medium/Long-Term (MLT) debt category in the table above includes loans from the European Investment Bank and Council of Europe Development Bank.  </p><p>A further &euro;19.6bn or 8% of the Gross National Debt is in the form of State Savings products such as Savings Certificates, Savings Bonds, National Solidarity Bonds and Prize Bonds. The majority of this debt is held by Irish citizens. </p><p>Non-marketable short-term paper debt, which comprises Exchequer Notes and Central Treasury Notes, is mostly held by Irish domestic public sector entities.</p><p>Of course, most of the public debt is in the forms of Irish Government bonds, which accounted for 65% of Gross National Debt at year-end 2021. While the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) is the registrar for Irish Government bonds, the way they are settled and registered does not allow for the identification of individual holders. </p><p>However, the CBI publishes some information on holders of Irish Government bonds, disaggregated between resident and non-resident holders. At year-end 2021 resident holders accounted for just over 50% of bonds outstanding. </p><p>Within the resident category, Credit Institutions and the Central Bank are by far the largest holders. This primarily reflects the purchase of bonds under the Quantitative Easing (QE) Programmes introduced by the European Central Bank (ECB) &ndash; the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) and more recently the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP)  &ndash; as well as the Floating Rate Bonds acquired by the CBI on the liquidation of IBRC in 2013.

With an initial focus on gender, due to the availability of data, Equality Budgeting has since been expanded across multiple dimensions of equality including gender, socio-economic, disability and minority groups.</p><p>An Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group (EBEAG) has been established to guide the development of Equality Budgeting policy. Representing key stakeholders such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the National Women&rsquo;s Council and the National Disability Authority, this group is chaired by my Department and has met regularly since 2018.</p><p>To drive this important work forward in line with international best practice, in 2019 the OECD was requested by my Department, and the Department of Justice and Equality, to conduct a scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. The report, published on Budget day 2020, supported the approach taken, and also provided twelve recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward. </p><p>Implementation of the report's recommendations is well advanced, is a continued focus of work, and includes the work-streams below.</p><p>In cooperation with my Department, the CSO conducted a data audit in 2020 to ascertain the availability of public service data that is disaggregated by equality dimension. This work was guided by the EBEAG and the audit findings were published alongside Budget 2021. The information is published on the CSO website and will continue to be updated as new data is identified.  </p><p>Following the data audit, work is now underway to identify a data strategy that will identify what actions are needed to improve the disaggregation of data and identify actions needed to address data gaps. This work is led by the CSO and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (D/CEDIY).  </p><p>A key OECD recommendation, that has underpinned overall implementation, was the establishment of an inter-departmental network of Equality Budgeting contact points.  In March 2021, Government agreed to establish an inter-departmental network on Equality Budgeting in order to facilitate the full implementation of Equality Budgeting across all departments, in line with this OECD recommendation. The network first met in June, and have since met on three further dates. The inter-departmental network members are tasked with:</p><p>-  ensuring that policy makers in their departments are fully aware of, and implementing, Equality Budgeting policy where applicable and </p><p>-  bringing all relevant work within their department to the attention of the Equality Budgeting unit, to ensure that strategic direction of Equality Budgeting is fully informed. </p><p><b>Wellbeing Budgeting</b></p><p>An initial multi-dimensional Well-being Framework for Ireland was published in July 2021.  Since then the CSO has launched an interactive dashboard to complement the Framework and a wide-ranging public consultation led by the Department of the Taoiseach is ongoing. My Department is in the process of piloting an approach of locating well-being within existing public policy. The approach builds on the performance budgeting initiative by placing an explicit focus on stated policy goals and evidence of progress. With regard to well-being, my Department intends to: </p><p>(1)  Put in place supports for other Departments to support them in using the Well-being Framework as part of the Spending Review process; and</p><p>(2)  Develop an approach to linking budget decisions with the various dimensions of the Well-being Framework.</p><p><b>Public Sector Duty</b></p><p>In line with the Public Sector Duty, under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, all public bodies assess and identify the human rights of women and girls and the gender equality issues that are relevant to their functions and address these in their strategic planning, policies and practices, and annual reports.</p><p>My Department published its Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 on 19/01/2021, which includes its Public Sector Human Rights and Equality obligations among the organisation&rsquo;s values. www.gov.ie/en/collection/da1589-dper-annual-reports-2013-16/#2020.</p><p><b>Next steps</b></p><p>We continue to work very closely with our colleagues in D/CEDIY to ensure that Equality Budgeting and gender mainstreaming work together to achieve common goals and on mutually beneficial policies. The Inter-departmental network outlined above is jointly chaired by D/CEDIY which ensures collaboration is maximised. </p><p>The actions outlined above, and the work plan in place for 2022, will continue to support the further development of Equality Budgeting, ensuring that that the momentum achieved to date will be maintained. </p><p>[1] A vacant board is an established board with no board members currently in place. </p></reply>

The launch of the Flood Risk Management Plans in May 2018, following the largest ever study of flood risk in Ireland, identified that Government investment is feasible to protect 95% of properties assessed to be at risk from significant flooding. The Government has committed &euro;1.3 billion to the delivery of some 150 additional flood relief schemes over the lifetime of the National Development Plan to 2030 to protect approximately 23,000 properties in threatened communities from river and coastal flood risk. The legislative basis for these works includes the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 and the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995.</p>  <p>  There have been a number of further amendments to the Principal Act that provide the statutory framework to ensure work on flood risk management by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland meets the European environmental assessment and other requirements. The most recent amendments were made in 2019 by way of S.I. 472/19, for the purposes of transposing EU Directive 2014/52/EU (Environmental Impact Assessment).  </p>  <p>  The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain Arterial Drainage Schemes carried out under the Arterial Drainage Acts. These maintenance works are carried out in accordance with relevant legislation, through a range of environmental assessments, including Strategic Environmental Assessments, Appropriate Assessments and Ecological Assessments, supported by widespread stakeholder consultation. Further information on environmental activities and associated environmental assessments and studies are available on the OPW website.</p>  <p>  To minimise potential ecological impacts, the OPW undertakes these statutory maintenance works having regard to a set of procedures called &ldquo;Environmental Guidance: Drainage Maintenance and Construction&rdquo;. This guidance was developed in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p>  <p>  The OPW continually monitors the legislative basis for its overall management of Ireland's flood risk, including working with all statutory bodies and with the European Commission.</p></reply>

A worker is defined in section 3 of the Act as being an individual who is or was: an employee; a contractor; an agency worker; a work-experience student (pursuant to a training course); or a trainee. A person in a work-based relationship with a political party would have to be a "worker" within the meaning of the Act to be entitled to its protections. </p>  <p>  The Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2022 provides, at section 4, for a significant expansion of the definition of a "worker" to include individuals who are: shareholders; members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of an undertaking; and volunteers as well as individuals who acquire information on a relevant wrongdoing during a recruitment process or any other pre-contractual negotiation. This expansion of the definition of "worker" - in particular by virtue of the inclusion of volunteers - means that members of political parties who report concerns of wrongdoing that come to their attention in the context of their activities with the party concerned should be protected by the Act when the Bill is enacted. </p>  <p>  In relation to how a protected disclosure can be made, the legislation, once amended by the Bill, will provide that a worker can report either internally to their employer; or externally to a prescribed person or the Protected Disclosures Commissioner; or, subject to more stringent criteria, make a public disclosure. Once the Bill is enacted, the Protected Disclosures Commissioner will be able to receive reports of any relevant wrongdoing within the scope of the legislation and will transmit the report to the most appropriate person to follow up on the alleged wrongdoing or, if no such person can be identified follow-up directly on the report. Workers who wish to report externally can also report directly to a relevant prescribed person - for example, a concern about health and safety can be reported directly to the Health and Safety Authority.</p></reply>

This will build on reforms introduced over the last number of years, including Performance Budgeting and Equality Budgeting, which seek to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework and ensure that expenditure is managed in an efficient and effective way and are focussed on providing the evidence base to support the efficient and effective delivery of services that have a positive impact on people's lives.  This work is being further enhanced with the development of the Wellbeing Framework for Ireland that can inform efforts to improve the impact of public policy.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework introduced means an ongoing consideration of budgetary priorities throughout the year, rather than focusing budget discussions only around Budget Day and seeks to support enhanced transparency and engagement in relation to budgetary issues. An important element of this is the publication at key points in the year of a range of documents including the Public Service Performance Report, the Summer Economic Statement, the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, and the Spending Review papers.   </p>  <p>  Given the significant level of resources to be provided under the medium term expenditure strategy, an ongoing and enhanced focus on value for money is required to ensure the benefit to the Exchequer and citizens. It is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister to manage expenditure within their respective allocations and careful monitoring of spending against profile and of progress on programmes and projects is required. My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices regarding this.  Spending figures are compiled monthly and published in the Fiscal Monitor to report on spend against profile for all Ministerial Vote Groups and the main spending Departments will continue to report to Government quarterly in 2022 on spending within their areas.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the public finances. Some &euro;30 billion in direct expenditure supports has been made available across 2020 and 2021 with provision for up to &euro;7 billion in Covid-19 related spending under Budget 2022.  This funding allowed Government to introduce a wide range of support schemes and measures in response to the impacts of the pandemic and extend these as necessary. Budget 2022 was prepared in line with the fiscal framework set out in the Summer Economic Statement, which allows us to meet core objectives set out in the Programme for Government of investing in our economy and society to deliver improvements in infrastructure and public services, while reducing the deficit in order to underpin the sustainability of the public finances as we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. </p></reply>

Additionally, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer in my Department is due to publish a new Public Service Digital Strategy very soon, and this will  clearly articulate our ambitions around further embedding digitisation and the increased delivery of digital services to the public. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure coherence and support for the reform efforts across the wider Public Service we have established the Public Service Management Group and Public Service Leadership Board, which draw on senior management from right across the Public Service. These senior level groups oversee the delivery of our reform programme for the public service. </p>  <p>  As regards the drive for more value for money all public organisations are required to treat public funds with care, and to ensure that the best possible value for money is obtained whenever public money is being spent or invested. This is in accordance with the Public Spending Code. Moreover, Action 5 of Our Public Service 2020 emphasises the need to ensure value-for-money principles are adhered to across the Public Service. </p>  <p>  As part of this broader approach to ensuring value for money, the introduction of shared services and centralised procurement in earlier phases of reform continue to be embedded in the delivery of services to clients and customers. My Department continues to actively explore new areas and mechanisms to further embed reforms and efficiencies that will enhance the cost-effectiveness of public services; for example, through greater use of opportunities presented through digitisation, intelligent automation, innovation and the implementation of new ways of working and service design.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that by agreeing to the Public Service Pay Agreement &lsquo;Building Momentum&rsquo;, all parties involved have committed to the ongoing reform and development of public services to meet the changing needs of citizens, communities, businesses and the staff who deliver our public services.</p></reply>

The NPPPF consists of 5 strands: Legislation (Directives, Regulations); Policy (Circulars, etc.); General Guidelines; the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF); and detailed technical guidelines, template documents and information notes that issue periodically.  This framework enables a consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector to deliver value for money for the taxpayer. </p>  <p>  Each individual Accounting Officer is responsible for the monitoring of performance of public contracts under his or her remit.  Each must ensure that the public procurement function is discharged in line with the standard accounting practices, procurement rules and procedures in an efficient and effective manner to deliver maximum value for money for the taxpayer.  Under Circular 40/2002,  all procurement contracts awarded without a competitive process and which exceed &euro;25,000 in value (exclusive of VAT), should be reviewed within the Department, preferably by the Internal Audit Unit or alternatively by an appropriate senior officer who is not part of the procurement process.  A report of such contracts is submitted to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General each year and copied to the Office of Government Procurement.</p>  <p>  The Interim Procurement Reform Board (the Board) was appointed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in 2017 to provide oversight to the delivery of the procurement reform programme.  In July 2021, officials from HSE Procurement presented to the interim Procurement Reform Board on the HSE&rsquo;s self-assessment of procurement performance in 2020.  While the Board welcomed the provision of the assessment, they raised concerns with the figures presented and the Board&rsquo;s Chairman subsequently wrote to me to advise me of the situation.  As this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health, but has expenditure implications which are of concern to me, I corresponded with him on it.   In his response, the Minister for Health advised that he has engaged with the HSE in relation to these matters and on the measures being put in place by  it to improve procurement performance.  My officials continue to engage with the HSE on the arrangements, actions and targets being undertaken to progress its procurement performance.  I have also asked that the interim Procurement Reform Board remain appraised on this matter.</p>  <p>  To assist Contracting Authorities in the conduct of procurement procedures, the OGP has published extensive guidance material for contracting authorities including the Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services (the Guidelines) available at: gov.ie/en/publication/c23f5-public-procurement-guidelines-for-goods-and-services/ and the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) available at: constructionprocurement.gov.ie/.  The Guidelines outline the various stages of the procurement process from specification, through to selection and award stages, and through to the contract management stage. They provide guidance on ensuring the specifications fully and accurately capture the requirement of the goods or services and identify the risks of poor specification and the challenges that this can cause Contracting Authorities when subsequently managing their contracts. </p>  <p>  The OGP and its sector partners in Health, Education, Local Government and Defence have a range of centralised procurement frameworks and dynamic purchasing systems in place in respect of sixteen categories of common goods and services to minimise administration and to deliver enhanced service levels and value for money promptly and efficiently. Contracting authorities are encouraged to check the Office of Government Procurement website for existing or planned procurement arrangements which may meet their needs.</p></reply>

The OGP established the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, bringing together officials from policy Departments with procurement practitioners to share best practice in relevant fields and to facilitate the process of incorporating social and environmental considerations into public procurement. </p>  <p>  Circular 20/2019 requires public bodies to incorporate relevant green procurement measures into their planning and reporting cycles. Defined, quantifiable, verifiable, and measurable criteria for a number of products and services have been developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 2021, for the first time, government departments reported to the EPA on the proportion of their procurement spend in 2020 that was green. The EPA is analysing this information and will report later this year.</p>  <p>  The appropriateness of including environmental, economic and social considerations is a decision for each contracting authority and should be examined on a contract-by-contract basis. Each contract should be effectively managed and monitored by the individual contracting authority. The National Public Procurement Guidelines provide public bodies with steps to follow when managing contracts. In addition, the OGP has been promoting the use of strategic procurement to be applied in line with each organisation&rsquo;s own strategic goals and wider government objectives. Through its Information Note on the subject, the OGP has advocated for the completion of a corporate procurement plan (CPP). CPPs can assist contracting authorities to align their procurement functions with wider environmental, economic and social considerations. The OGP recommends that public bodies consider the incorporation of wider strategic considerations from the outset and have flagged the planning phase as the most critical stage. </p>  <p>  The OGP and its partner central purchasing bodies (CPBs) have been reviewing all central purchasing arrangements to identify opportunities to include green considerations. 165 central arrangements had been updated to include specific green criteria by the end of 2021. A further 41 arrangements will be updated to include green criteria this year and next.</p>  <p>  Finally, my officials present at a range of public sector events and seminars to promote green and social public procurement and will continue to promote utilising the State&rsquo;s purchasing power to deliver on our commitments to sustainable development and social inclusion. Environmental, economic and social procurement considerations are also discussed with business representative bodies at the SME Advisory Group meeting which is chaired by my colleague, Minister of State Ossian Smyth. Following consultation with SME representatives, the OGP developed a suite of policy measures aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities (implemented through Circular 10/2014). </p>  <p>  Together with Minister Smyth and the OGP, I will continue to monitor and enhance the significant measures and strategies in place to support the inclusion of environmental, economic and social considerations in public procurement opportunities.</p></reply>

Submissions received will be published on my Department's website in due course.</p>  <p>  In parallel with this consultation process, my Department will continue to engage as appropriate with the Office of Public Procurement in order to advance the appointment of a consultant to undertake the overall review and make recommendations to the Department on the matter in due course. Submissions received on foot of the public consultation process will be taken into account as part of the review.  By way of  background information in relation to this aspect in particular, the Deputy may be aware that my Department has been working with the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) since the middle of last year in order to progress the appointment of consultants to undertake the review. Tenders have been sought from the market on two separate occasions since last summer  but none were received on either occasion. In order to expedite matters, the public consultation element of the process commenced last week, while further efforts will be made to engage a consultancy as outlined.</p></reply>

All of the improvements which were introduced for recent rounds of the Programme to make the process as user-friendly as possible were maintained for this round. This included giving applicants a second chance to submit corrected documentation. The full scoring system and assessment procedures can be viewed on the sportscapitalprogramme.ie website.</p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on 6 August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p>  <p>  My Department will soon be in contact with all unsuccessful applicants. All of these organisations will have the opportunity to appeal the Department's decision and full details of the appeals procedure will issue shortly. Of the record &euro;150 million made available for capital projects, &euro;6 million has been kept in reserve for any successful appeals lodged by unsuccessful applicants. </p>  <p>  When the appeals process is complete, a full review of the 2020 round of the SCEP will be undertaken and any recommendations contained therein will be included in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete.</p></reply>

Early delivery occurred across a number of these (i.e., infrastructure, audiovisual production, and the global dimension).  Key Departments and Agencies considered that significant scope remains for continuing implementation in relation to young people and communities in the years ahead.  Similarly, there was a recognition of the benefits that arise from a focus on creative industries more broadly; enhanced collaboration and integration across the arts, healthcare and social care sectors; and enabling the cultural and creative sectors to support a more sustainable and inclusive society.</p>  <p>  In February 2022, Government agreed in principle that Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Creative Ireland Programme will continue for a further five years encompassing the period 2023-2027 and will focus on the following pillars: Creative Youth; Creative Communities; Creative Industries; Creative Health and Wellbeing; and Creative Climate Action and Sustainability.  This in-principle decision is intended to facilitate the development of the future Programme details through collaboration amongst departments, public bodies, and key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  My  Department is now commencing further more detailed discussions and consultations with key Departments and Agencies across each of the five priority areas to develop strategic objectives for the next phase of the programme.  Wide-ranging consultations with key sectoral organisations and representative bodies including the Boards of Management and leadership of schools will also be undertaken by relevant Departments and Agencies, while a separate consultation for children and youth will be facilitated by Hub na n&Oacute;g.</p>  <p>  As well as reflecting on the outcomes of evaluations and research undertaken or in progress as part of the current Programme, public consultations across communities in the 31 local authorities will also be undertaken to finalise individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2023-2027.</p>  <p>  A final more detailed framework for Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Creative Ireland Programme 2023-2027 is expected to be brought to Government for its agreement in Autumn 2022 prior to its publication, launch and implementation on an all-of-government basis.</p></reply>

Its core proposition is that participation in arts, cultural and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.</p><p>Under the Creative Communities initiative in the Creative Ireland Programme, my department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 Local Authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022. These Strategies were developed in 2017 following extensive local public consultation and are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area as well as the strategic priorities identified by the local community. Highly innovative, multi-disciplinary Culture and Creativity Teams in every Local Authority support and drive the relevant, locally-agreed, strategic priorities and projects.</p><p>Furthermore, since 2018 my Department has also provided each local authority with additional funding to support the delivery of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g - the national day of free creativity for children and young people under 18 years of age. While it is a key initiative of the Creative Youth Plan, the 31 Local Authority Culture and Creativity Teams have been key to its nationwide delivery.</p><p>The number of events and initiatives organised by county as part of the Creative Ireland Creative Communities strand (and Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g) is listed in Table 1 below; programming by the 31 local authorities is currently underway for 2022. </p><p>In 2021, a strategic review of the Creative Communities initiative led by the Creative Ireland Programme and the County and City Management Association was published. It examined the effectiveness to date in embedding creativity within public policy at local level, and in deploying creativity as a strategy for wellbeing, social cohesion and economic development. While broadly positive in its findings, the review also explored how delivery in collaboration with the 31 local authorities could be optimised in the future. These recommendations continue to be implemented as the initiative looks towards the period 2023-2027.</p><p><b>Table 1</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority</th>       <th>Creative Communities<br /><br />2018-2021 (inclusive) </th>       <th>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g<br /><br />2018-2021 (inclusive) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>117 </td>       <td>41 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>164 </td>       <td>49 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>157 </td>       <td>91 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>-          Cork City</td>       <td>71 </td>       <td>82 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>-          Cork County</td>       <td>119 </td>       <td>74 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>146 </td>       <td>81 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>-          Dublin City</td>       <td>75 </td>       <td>179 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>-          D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown</td>       <td>93 </td>       <td>92 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>-          Fingal</td>       <td>76 </td>       <td>70 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>-          South County Dublin</td>       <td>93 </td>       <td>141 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>-          Galway City</td>       <td>88 </td>       <td>43 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>-          Galway County</td>       <td>87 </td>       <td>64 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>106 </td>       <td>71 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>152 </td>       <td>58 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>76 </td>       <td>23 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>85 </td>       <td>37 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>125 </td>       <td>71 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>188 </td>       <td>40 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>181 </td>       <td>54 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>93 </td>       <td>30 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>110 </td>       <td>52 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>102 </td>       <td>68 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>75 </td>       <td>49 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>137 </td>       <td>110 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>118 </td>       <td>58 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>113 </td>       <td>59 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>137 </td>       <td>50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>179 </td>       <td>89 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>167 </td>       <td>84 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>83 </td>       <td>87 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>48 </td>       <td>80 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This robust and wide-ranging research programme covers the views of 1,000 employers and 3,500 workers with tourism and hospitality experience as well as international benchmarking, a review of education provision and consultation with recruitment agencies. This research is shaping F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s work programmes for the year ahead which will focus on:</p>  <p>  - Supporting recruitment to drive recovery:  to provide support to the industry to address the immediate labour and skills supply challenges, which will be critical to the short-medium term recovery of the sector.</p>  <p>  - Supporting the long-term repositioning of the industry: to support businesses and the wider industry to work together to drive the long-term repositioning of the industry as an appealing and rewarding career choice and workplace, and ensure a future pipeline of talent.</p>  <p>  - Building employee capability and skills: to build the capability of individual employees to help businesses to bridge the skills gaps they are experiencing and also drive greater employee retention by improving the quality of training across the business.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also chairs the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group (COG) which will continue to work closely with industry bodies, education providers and other Government bodies to support sustainable employment in the tourism sector with an immediate focus on recruitment and retention initiatives, as well as focusing on the long-term repositioning of the industry as a career choice.  My Department and the Department of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology are represented on the COG.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department also participate in the Interdepartmental Group on Work Permits chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Most recently the work of the Group resulted in up to 350 work permits being granted for managerial positions in certain tourism and hospitality businesses. Last year, my Department also successfully advocated for the prioritisation of chef permit applications.</p>  <p>  I have also recently worked with Minister Donohoe on the extension of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. I will continue to engage with and provide support to the tourism sector through these challenging times.</p></reply>

It is intended to build on this for this year&rsquo;s Culture Night.</p>  <p>  Following on from a successful roll-out of vulnerability training last December which supports the recommendation on the issue of public safety, my Department is supporting the delivery of additional on-line vulnerability training, commencing in March. This training has been developed with and is supported by the nightclub sector (Give Us The Night), the Vintners Associations, Restaurant Association of Ireland, the local authorities and also with the support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made with our partners in the local authority to develop the pilot initiative establishing new "Night-Time Advisors" in six cities and towns to develop new Night-Time Economy opportunities.   </p>  <p>  Work is also well underway in relation to action 5 which recommends organising dedicated activation workshops to determine actions that are required to support night-time economy initiatives for different age groups. The process of consultation will begin with the 16-24 age group.  My Department is working with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to identify an appropriate model of engagement for this specific age group. The next scheduled phase of consultation/workshops will be an older demographic and my Department will work with the appropriate agencies to determine the best models of engagement for this age demographic.</p>  <p>  The action which recommends a comprehensive audit of arts and cultural facilities, and event spaces nationwide which could potentially be used in the Night-Time Economy is the responsibility of the Arts Council and my officials will be engaging with the Arts Council to progress this recommendation in the Report.</p>  <p>  I look forward to continued progress across all areas of this Report over the coming months.</p></reply>

My Department recently met with the Council of National Cultural Institutions (CNCI) to offer support where required to develop this action further and the National Cultural Institutions are working together with the Department to progress this.</p><p>In addition, my Department has provided additional support to the National Cultural Institutions through the allocation of a further &euro;5 million in Budget 2022. This funding was intended to support a range of initiatives, including the extension of opening hours where deemed practicable. To that end:</p><p>- The Crawford Art Gallery has planned extended opening hours on Thursday evenings, closing the galleries at 8pm instead of 5pm and offering free tours for visitors.</p><p>- The Chester Beatty Library have programmed late night opening on Wednesday evenings, for which various talks, tours and events have been organised. This will include a special lecture series to coincide with the exhibition &quot;Meeting in Isfahan: Vision and Exchange in Safavid Iran,&quot; which will take place onsite in the lecture theatre, as well as online.</p><p>- IMMA extended its opening hours on a trial basis from 22<sup>nd</sup>October 2021 as part of its 30<sup>th</sup>birthday commemoration. This extension of opening hours is effective three days per week. IMMA is continuing with this trial of extended hours through Spring 2022.</p><p>- The National Museum of Ireland is currently working with its staff and management teams to enable the piloting of extended hours in Spring / Summer 2022.</p><p>While the NCIs under the aegis of my Department are independent in their management of day-to-day matters, I am delighted that they have taken the initiative to make their world-class exhibitions and programmes available to the public through these extended hours.</p></reply>

After a period of extensive research and consultation, the National Cultural Institutions purchased 422 works by 70 artists, of whom 45 were female. This addition of new works, 64% of which were by women, is an important step in establishing a greater gender balance in our National Collections.  8 of our National Cultural Institutions are led by women.</p>  <p>  Regarding those outcomes in the area of sport, a fundamental aim of the Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to increase the levels of participation in sport and physical activity across the population, with a specific focus on less represented groups including women and girls and to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport entirely by 2027.  One of my priorities in 2021 was to eliminate the funding gap that existed in grant funding for male and female Gaelic players.   This aim have been achieved, ensuring that we have now parity in terms of grant funding.   </p>  <p>  Last year, Sport Ireland announced an investment of &euro;4m in the Women in Sport Programme for the two years 2021 and 2022. 45 NGBs will receive funding under this investment.   A further &euro;265,000 was invested last year in the Local Sports Partnerships under the Programme. </p>  <p>  A gender gap is beginning to re-emerge as COVID 19 restrictions are lifted.  To this end, many National Governing Bodies are delivering Women in Sport and Dormant Accounts Funded Programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities.</p>  <p>  Addressing women&rsquo;s participation at all levels in sport is an important element of the National Sports Policy.  That includes women in leadership positions, such as board members of National Governing Bodies.  The National Sports Policy had originally set a target of 30% of either gender on the Boards of funded bodies by 2027.  In the new Action Plan for Sport 2021-2023, which was published in November 2021, we have set a revised target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023.    It is a priority to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation.</p>  <p>  I would refer the Deputy to the detailed reply on the progress of our work as outlined by my colleague Minister of State Jack Chambers TD, in his reply to D&aacute;il Question No. 50 of Thursday 24 February.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore,  there are twenty-one varied and diverse State Boards under the remit of the Department.  At the end of 2021, there was an average of 50% female representation on these boards of these bodies. </p>  <p>  I trust that this information is of assistance  to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Kerry. This route is part of EuroVelo - the European cycle route network &ndash; comprising 17 long distance cycle routes passing through 42 countries including Ireland.  EuroVelo is intended to encourage European citizens to cycle and so to promote a shift to healthy and sustainable travel for daily trips, recreation and cycling tourism. </p>  <p>  There are two such routes in the State. EuroVelo 1, the Atlantic Coast route, and EuroVelo 2, the Capitals route. EuroVelo 1 travels around the coast from Rosslare Harbour in Co. Wexford to Bridge End in Co. Donegal covering over 2300km. From Bridge End it continues across the border into Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The route has been developed through a partnership approach involving Sport Ireland, acting as National EuroVelo Coordinator, working with each of the relevant local authorities to identify a suitable route meeting the criteria for EuroVelo as defined by the European Cyclists Federation (ECF). The ECF is the co-ordinating body for EuroVelo at a European level. The full route in Ireland was assessed using a methodology defined by the ECF.</p>  <p>  The guidance for the development of EuroVelo is that routes should be relatively straightforward without too many detours, should not include spurs off the route and should be one continuous line. In this context it is not intended that the route would detour to visit every village along its 2300km length. EuroVelo routes are intended to form a backbone from which cyclists can explore locations on either side of the main route. </p>  <p>  It is intended that promotional material for the route will be used to inform cyclists about any points of interest on or adjacent to the route. These can be identified using directional signage where appropriate. In many cases directional signage will already be in place. </p>  <p>  The erection of directional signage to points of interest along the route is a matter for the local authorities.</p>  <p>  For the EuroVelo 1 route in Ireland there will soon be a dedicated website where any points of interest along the route in each county can be highlighted. The complete route in Ireland is due to be fully signposted in the coming weeks and is expected to be launched along with the related website before the summer.</p>  <p>  In terms of tourism marketing and promotion of the route, Sport Ireland has kept F&aacute;ilte Ireland fully informed in terms of the development and roll out of the signage and both agencies are engaging to consider ways to include the cycle route in relevant tourism marketing and promotional initiatives.</p></reply>

This work is being led by my Department, in consultation with other Departments and Agencies, with maritime stakeholders and with the wider public.</p>  <p>  In broad terms, MPAs are geographically identified areas where measures are put in place to conserve marine features such as species, habitats or other parts of the marine ecosystem for example. They can take a wide variety of forms, ranging from marine reserves, sanctuaries or designated parks for example, to areas in which the sustainable use of resources is permitted or where harmful human activities are restricted.</p>  <p>  The process underpinning this work began in 2019 with the convening of an advisory group to provide independent expert advice and recommendations on expanding Ireland&rsquo;s MPA network. This advice was published in January 2021. Informed by the expert advice and  public consultation feedback my Department is now developing the necessary legislation for the identification, designation and management of MPAs. This  work will continue throughout 2022 with the aim of publishing the heads of a bill in the autumn of this year. The issue of the establishment of an offshore maritime area as a national park can be considered once progress is made on the broader MPA objective.</p></reply>

It ensures the scheme is sustainable, and the tenant purchasing the house has the financial means to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period. Subject to meeting this requirement, monies for the purchase of a house may come from several sources, including savings, a mortgage provided by a financial institution, or a local authority house purchase loan. </p>  <p>  The scheme was reviewed in 2021 in line with Programme for Government and Housing for All commitments. The Government approved a number of amendments on foot of the review and these came into effect on 1st February 2022.</p>  <p>  The amendments include a reduction in the minimum reckonable income required to be eligible under the scheme from &euro;15,000 to &euro;12,500.

In addition, and complementary to the constitutional provisions of Article 16.2 in particular, Part II of the Electoral Act 1997 (as amended) provides for a constituency review following each Census of Population and establishes, among other things, the terms of reference of a Constituency Commission.</p>  <p>  In very broad terms, the publication of preliminary census results triggers the establishment of a Constituency Commission under section 5(1) of the Electoral Act 1997 with the Commission required, under section 9(1) of that Act, to present its report on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies to the chairman of the D&aacute;il within three months of publication of final census results. The timing for the publication of both preliminary census results and final census results are matters for the Central Statistics Office but typically have taken place within approximately 3 months and 12 months respectively of the holding of the census.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, in January 2021, Minister O'Brien and I published the General Scheme of the Electoral Reform Bill. The general scheme addresses a number of commitments in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future including the commitment to establish a statutory Electoral Commission. The general scheme has been published on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/34cf6-general-scheme-of-the-electoral-reform-bill-2020/. The Bill is included on the list of priority legislation in the Government's current legislation programme and I expect that it will be published and will commence its progress through the Oireachtas shortly.</p>  <p>  The Electoral Commission will be independent of Government and will report directly to the Oireachtas. Following its establishment, it will, among other matters, take on several existing statutory electoral functions from the outset, including the work currently undertaken by constituency commissions and local electoral area boundary committees.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, the Government, on the advice of the Central Statistics Office, decided to postpone the 2021 Census due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The next census is now due to take place on 3 April 2022. The next review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies will commence following the publication of preliminary census results, will be undertaken in compliance with our constitutional requirements and will be completed in accordance with the statutory timeframe.</p>  <p>  Unlike the position for D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies, there is no constitutional or legislative requirement for the revision of local electoral areas.</p>  <p>  Section 23 of the Local Government Act 2001 empowers the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to divide a local authority area into local electoral areas and to amend those areas. However, in advance of deciding to make an order under section 23 of the Act, the Minister must, in accordance Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 (as amended), request a boundary committee to make a report having regard to such matters as may be specified by the Minister.</p>  <p>  The Minister must publish the report of the boundary committee and must have regard to the report of that committee when deciding to make an order in relation to any amendment to local electoral area boundaries.</p>  <p>  At this point in time, no decision has been taken in relation to a review of local electoral area boundaries in advance of the next local elections in 2024.</p></reply>

Action 8.5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan makes a commitment &ldquo;to improve gender balance at each level by reviewing supports and policies to ensure these are impactful and measurable&rdquo;. My Department fully supports this commitment.</p>  <p>  My Department has proactively managed its gender balance particularly at senior management level where at Assistant Principal (AP) and Principal Officer (PO) levels there was a relatively low representation of females in the past. At the most senior level of my Department 50% of Assistant Secretaries and equivalents are female. However, in January 2021 only 28% of POs and equivalents and 44% of AP and equivalents were female. Following a concerted focus on encouraging greater numbers of women to apply for senior roles in my Department, these levels have improved over the past year and at the end of January 2022 of 42% of POs and equivalent were female and 47% of AP and equivalents were female. My Department is very encouraged by this growth in female participation in these two grades and will continue to monitor gender equality across all grades.</p>  <p>  A gender action plan has been developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department is committed to advancing the actions set down in the plan, and has developed its own departmental action plan. My Department has also established a senior working group who are looking at ways to improve female participation rate at a senior level. My Department actively supports family friendly initiatives such as flexible working hours, shorter working year and work sharing across all the grades where appropriate. A diversity policy will also be developed in 2022 which will include gender equality measures.</p></reply>

These include the contribution of the local government sector to the General Government Balance (GGB) and controls exercised under the Expenditure Benchmark requirements. The key factors that must be controlled by local authorities in relation to GGB requirements are as follows:</p><p>- Revenue account balanced- no deficit</p><p>- Capital account (excl Agency debtors type expenditure and non-mortgage borrowing) balanced</p><p>- Net increase in non&ndash;mortgage borrowing limited to levels sanctioned.</p><p>- Net bank position limited to previous years level. </p><p>Local authorities have been directed that, similar to their revenue account activity, capital expenditure should not exceed capital income within the reporting year. Development contributions are recorded in the capital account of local authorities. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves.</p><p>However, within these overall limits, there is capacity for the expenditure of built up capital balances and own resources, or expenditure supported by borrowing, which must be sanctioned by the Minister with policy responsibility for the specific programme involved.

It can cause significant disruption to their hearing systems and normal behaviour, and may lead to permanent or even lethal injury. Accordingly, I wrote to both Minister Coveney and the Russian Ambassador to express these concerns.</p>  <p>  Regulation 27 of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011-2021 outlines public authority responsibilities and duties under the 2011 Regulations and states that public authorities shall exercise their functions in compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives.</p>  <p>  It creates a responsibility for compliance with the Directives that permeates throughout the public sector, rather than solely within the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Other public authorities that would have responsibility for activities in the Irish EEZ include the Naval Service (overseen by the Department of Defence) and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority; the identification of the appropriate competent authority would be contingent upon the location and type of activities proposed.</p>  <p>  My Department did not receive notification of or applications relating to the issue outlined by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Part of the impetus for this work arises from the review of fire safety in Ireland carried out in the aftermath of the Grenfell tragedy in the UK. It is also my intention that the Bill will place relevant elements of evolved emergency management practice at national and local level on a statutory footing and also revise the legislative approach to certain aspects of public safety in Ireland, with an initial focus on safety at funfairs.</p>  <p>  A General Scheme of the Bill is being preparation within my Department. This has been informed by consultation with the relevant sectors likely to be impacted by its provisions. The shape of the Bill has been considered on a number of occasions by the Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM). The Board is comprised of Chief Executive Officers from local authorities, the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) as well as other Government Departments and supports the general approach being taken in the Bill.  However, there is still a need for further consultation with both stakeholders and our other Government partners to ensure Bill brought forward is both comprehensive and robust.</p>  <p>  The intention of the Bill is to support and strengthen the role of local authorities. The provision of fire services in local authority areas, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises, is a statutory function of each individual fire authority. The work of local authority fire services has, to a large degree, been underpinned by the Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003 for nearly 40 years. While this legislation has served the country well, and key indicators such as fatalities from fire per million of population have been reduced consistently to the point where they are at their lowest for forty years, it is appropriate now to ensure that the underpinning legislation fully reflects the changes is society and the expanded and more dynamic roles that our local authority fire services have taken on in recent years. For that reason, the opinions of the local government sector have been sought as to the shape this legislation should take and preliminary opinion has also been received from the Local Government Management Association.</p>  <p>  Like all legislation, this is a complex piece of work, which necessitates consideration of multifaceted issues that impact on a number of sectors. The current Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 have stood the test of time for nearly 40 years. I want to ensure that its replacement also stands the test of time and when my Department is satisfied that the legislation being brought forward is appropriate, balanced, complete and robust, a Memorandum will be brought to Government on the issue in due course, followed by publication of the Bill.</p></reply>

Section 103 of the Local Government Act, 2001, as amended, provides for the local authority budgetary process. It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. This includes the taking in charge of housing estates.</p>  <p>  The taking in charge of housing estates by local authorities is provided for under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act), and the procedures for this are initiated under section 11 of the Roads Act, 1993. In addition to financial decision making, the taking in charge of residential estates is also a reserved function of the elected members.</p>  <p>  The intention of the relevant provisions in the Act is that once a residential estate is completed, the planning authority can be requested to take over the roads and footpaths, public lighting and open spaces. However, where work has not been completed to satisfactory standards, there can be a delay in this process as enforcement proceedings against concerned developers, including invocation of bonds, are progressed.</p>  <p>  Subsection 2 of section 180 requires a planning authority, where requested by the majority of the owners of the dwellings involved, to take in charge a residential estate even if it has not been completed to the satisfaction of the authority, if four years have elapsed since the expiry of the planning permission and no enforcement action has been initiated.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, progression of individual developments through the taking-in-charge process is a matter for the relevant housing developer, the residents in such developments and the relevant local authorities, following the procedures set out in section 180 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Under Section 30 of the Act, I, in my role as Minister with responsibility for planning, am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned.</p></reply>

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned. The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern and are being taken very seriously. It is important that we establish the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response on the best knowledge and evidence available. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at the local level.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes a detailed monthly report on homelessness, based on data provided by housing authorities. The Report outlines details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities. The Reports are available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/homelessness/other/homelessness-data</p>  <p>  While the information requested in respect of the number of deaths of homeless service users on a county basis is not available in my Department, a pilot study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board (HRB) on behalf of the Department of Health. It is hoped that the HRB will be in a position to publish the study shortly. The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, involves the review of approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts. The Department will engage with the Department of Health on completion of this study. </p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to support all individuals experiencing homelessness. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in doing this.</p></reply>

The following six applications were received by the deadline of 30 June 2021: </p>  <p>  - The Passage Tomb Landscape of County Sligo</p>  <p>  - Inis Cealtra, County Clare</p>  <p>  - Transatlantic Cable Ensemble: Valentia-Heart&rsquo;s Content, County Kerry and Newfoundland, Canada</p>  <p>  - The Cultural Landscape of the Burren Uplands, County Clare</p>  <p>  - The Royal Sites of Ireland, (D&uacute;n Ailinne, Hill of Uisneach, Cashel, Rathcroghan Complex, Tara Complex, and Navan Fort)</p>  <p>  - Glendalough Valley, County Wicklow</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware I appointed an Expert Advisory Group (EAG) to review all six applications and their recommendations were submitted to me and issued to the applicants last November. The EAG considered that only the Sligo application had sufficiently demonstrated Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), i.e. was able to show that the site was so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries. UNESCO's World Heritage requirements in respect of OUV are critical in determining what sites should be included on the Tentative List. The EAG determined that there was more work to be done by the other applicants to see if they could sufficiently demonstrate OUV.  In addition, the EAG also considered that the full implications of being a World Heritage Property in terms of long-term management, protection and conservation, alongside capacity building and the resources needed to progress any future World Heritage nomination dossier required further consideration by all applicants.  </p>  <p>  Given the issues raised by the EAG, and having engaged further with all the applicants over recent weeks, my Department has reconvened the EAG to offer further detailed technical advice and support to all applicants, so they may attempt to address issues raised in terms of the EAG recommendations, and to offer further specific advice and guidance in terms of the future management of a World Heritage Property. </p>  <p>  I anticipate that this current support process will be concluded around June 2022 and I would intend to make an announcement then on the composition of a new Tentative List. It is important to reiterate that only those sites whose applications - by the conclusion of this new support phase of engagement - clearly demonstrate OUV will be included on the new Tentative List. If by the conclusion of this current process, any applications require yet further work to determine eligibility in terms of OUV we will continue to offer our support.</p>  <p>  It should be stressed that if any application does not demonstrate OUV for UNESCO World Heritage process purposes, this does not in any way lessen the significance of the site in terms of its heritage and meaning to those communities who care passionately about them; in such a case we would continue to offer our support in whatever way we can to ensure that this ambition for our wonderful heritage is recognised.</p></reply>

Furthermore, it provides that the household&rsquo;s eligibility shall be reassessed at the point of allocation of support.

The closing date for applications was 14 October 2016. It was open to all local authorities to apply, with funding to be allocated on the basis of a competitive bid process in relation to proposals with the capacity to secure the early delivery of additional housing at scale, including at affordable prices. A total of 74 proposals, from 21 local authorities were received initially.</p><p>Approval was given for 30 projects under LIHAF in 2017 in order to stimulate the development of approximately 20,000 housing units across 14 local authorities. There has been no further call under the LIHAF fund since then. The list of approved projects and related funding is available at assets.gov.ie/45575/913180878aa647e29f8bcb65ffc2170c.pdf.</p><p>Of the 30 approved projects, 3 projects are not proceeding, 10 have been completed, and 9 are currently under construction. 3 projects are at or close to tender stage, and the remaining 5 projects are being kept under review. </p><p>Kildare County Council submitted seven projects for consideration under LIHAF at Naas, Kildare.

Cork City Council deployed a crew of whole-time firefighters to Ballincollig as a temporary measure, but I understand that arrangement has now ceased and that fire risk in the area is being managed by an appropriate arrangement of fire cover response from the network of fire stations in the region, together with statutory and community fire safety measures. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the non-availability of any particular fire station does not mean that fire risk management, including fire service response, is diminished. The systemic approach to fire risk management, which has been the policy in use in this country for a more than a decade, has seen a welcome and steady downward trend in fire losses in Ireland. While each fire death is one too many, the fire death rate per million of population, averaged over three years, stands at 4.2, a figure which is one third of what it was 10 years ago.  </p>  <p>  Provision of a retained fire service in Ballincollig remains the objective of the City Council, and a new recruitment campaign is underway for retained firefighters in Ballincollig. It is hoped that suitable candidates will be interested in taking up roles as retained firefighters, and that the local business community will consider facilitating any staff that go forward for this valuable community service.  </p>  <p>  In relation to average response times of individual fire stations, my Department does not collect that granular level of information. That information would be available from the relevant Council.</p></reply>

The minimum income requirement has a dual purpose - it ensures the scheme is sustainable, and the tenant purchasing the house has the financial means to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period.</p>  <p>  The scheme was reviewed in 2021 in line with Programme for Government and Housing for All commitments. The Government approved a number of amendments on foot of the review and these came into effect on 1st February 2022.</p>  <p>  The amendments include a reduction in the minimum reckonable income required from &euro;15,000 to &euro;12,500. This means older tenants, whose only income might be the contributory or non-contributory State pension, will be eligible to buy their homes if they have the financial means to do so. The time an applicant is required to be in receipt of social housing supports to be able to apply under the scheme has also been revised. This has been increased from one to ten years. </p>  <p>  Further changes to the scheme are currently being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda.</p></reply>

However, certain long-term State benefit payments may be considered as repayment income only where the main income source is of an earned nature (i.e., more than 50% of the income that forms the full Home Loan application is from a source other than State benefits payments).</p><p>Long-term State benefit payments considered will be: </p><p>- State Pension (Contributory and Non-contributory); </p><p>- Widow&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s Pension; </p><p>- Blind Pension; </p><p>- Invalidity Pension; </p><p>- Disability Allowance.</p><p>The long-term nature of the payment must be confirmed by the Department of Social Protection or other relevant Government Department.</p><p>The One-Parent Family Payment is not taken into account as income for repayment capacity for local authority lending. As noted above, social welfare payments may only be considered where the main source of income is earned, therefore where One-Parent Family Payment is the main source of income it cannot be counted.  As the One-Parent Family Payment can also be impacted if the borrower's circumstances change it cannot be factored in as a long term source of income. </p><p>The final decision regarding Local Authority Home Loan applications are made by the relevant Local Authority Credit Committee on a case by case basis.  Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the Regulations establishing the scheme and the credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and the lending local authority.  My Department is not involved in individual loan decisions.</p><p>Further details can be found on <i>localauthorityhomeloan.ie/</i>.</p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority. </p><p>The number of inspections undertaken in 2020 and in 2021 to the end of Q3 are set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Physical   Inspections <br /><br />carried out</th>       <th>Virtual Inspections <br /><br />carried out</th>       <th>Total Inspections <br /><br />carried out</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>24,315</td>       <td>1,388</td>       <td>25,703</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 to Q3</td>       <td>7,174</td>       <td>4,643</td>       <td>11,817</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Local authority data in respect of Q4 2021 is currently being collated and verified by my Department but indications are that virtual inspections only accounted for circa 5% of all inspections undertaken in that period.</p><p>Under this Government&rsquo;s housing plan - Housing for All - targets for the inspection of rental properties will be set at 25% of all private residential tenancies, as soon as Covid-19 public health restrictions permit. No target is set specifically for virtual inspections and local authorities have the discretion to use whichever inspection type they deem most appropriate to a situation.</p><p>Pandemic restrictions greatly impacted on inspection activity since March 2020. The County and City Management Association&rsquo;s (CCMA) Local Authority Services Frameworks for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response did not permit on-site rental inspections for long periods in 2020 and 2021. This was in order to protect tenants, landlords and inspectors. Even when restrictions were relaxed there was still a reluctance on the part of some tenants to allow authorised inspectors access their homes. Inspections have been and continue to be frustrated by some tenants needing to self-isolate due to having Covid-19 or being a close contact.</p><p>In response some local authorities piloted virtual inspections which my Department supported with Exchequer funding. Dublin City Council led this initiative and commenced virtual inspections in May 2020. My Department incorporated and standardised the approach taken countrywide into a pilot programme, requesting business cases from participating local authorities to ensure that processes are suitably robust and comprehensive.</p><p>The Department deems a virtual inspection to have been carried out when a decision is made on whether or not a dwelling is compliant with the Regulations, based on a review of the:</p><p>- landlord&rsquo;s completed self-assessment checklist </p><p>- photographic/video evidence provided </p><p>- local authority&rsquo;s engagement with the tenant in respect of any non-compliance issues they may be aware of and whether or not they can confirm if the landlord&rsquo;s checklist answers are correct.</p><p>It is a key component of the virtual inspection model that local authorities reserve the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so and landlords were advised accordingly. Many rented dwellings have been subsequently re-inspected physically, since pandemic restrictions have eased.</p><p>As set down in Housing for All  I believe that the potential offered by a virtual inspection approach needs to be fully explored. This is being done through an ongoing process of evaluation.</p></reply>

The importance of the Emigrant Support Programme in this regard was underscored in our reponse to the Covid-19 pandemic with the creation of a dedicated Covid Response Fund of nearly &euro;2 million tailored to help Irish communities abroad work collectively to protect our most vulnerable emigrants. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides significant funding to a number of organisations based in Ireland, including Crosscare and Safe Home, to support returning emigrants in crisis situations.  We recently expanded our support to the Samaritans, to provide 24-hour Freephone access to their helpline in Ireland for Irish people abroad.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of these projects to provide advice and assistance for the Irish abroad who are in distress, struggling to cope or who are in need of emotional support.</p>  <p>  The Government's new Diaspora Strategy recognises that the well-being of our Diaspora is dependent on having strong and active community engagement.  To this end we also support projects which preserve and build that sense of community, promoting vibrant networks and a sense of Irishness.  In this regard, substantial support is provided to sporting, cultural and heritage organisations such as the GAA and Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann for the important role they play in keeping our communities abroad connected to each other and to Ireland. </p>  <p>  The 2022 Emigrant Support Programme funding round was launched in January.  It prioritises outreach to those who are less connected to our existing networks, or who may have disengaged or been unable to access supports during the pandemic.  It recognises the need to heal the relationship with our emigrants who left Ireland in crisis, as a result of discrimination or as victims of institutional abuse, with a particular focus on initiatives to support those survivors living abroad. Announcements on the disbursement of this year's ESP funding round will be made in the coming months. </p></reply>

The Order blocks certain property of DAB and requires it to be transferred into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The ultimate fate of the frozen funds remains as yet unclear, due both to various legal cases in the US courts and to the likely delay of several months to finalise modalities relating to the Executive Order. The US Administration has said that they will consult widely with international partners during that time.</p>  <p>  I am extremely concerned by the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, which now has the highest number of people in emergency food insecurity in the world. In response, Ireland through its Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme, Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;4 million in humanitarian support for the people of Afghanistan since mid-August. This funding has been allocated to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) and UNICEF respectively. These emergency response programmes are addressing the urgent needs of the population, including providing food aid, treatment for severe acute malnutrition in children, and other essential services. As Ireland&rsquo;s aid has been allocated directly to UN agencies, it is not impacted by measures taken by the US in relation to freezing or unfreezing assets of the Central Bank of Afghanistan.</p>  <p>  I and my officials have been active in discussions on addressing the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan at EU level and especially at the UN Security Council, prioritising a continued core role for the UN in the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to the millions who need it. In an effort to further alleviate the dire humanitarian situation, Ireland strongly advocated for UN Security Council Resolution 2615 on humanitarian exemptions from UN sanctions against members of the Taliban. Agreed unanimously in December 2021, these exemptions will ensure that humanitarian activity is not impeded by UN sanctions and will assist in meeting the basic needs of the Afghan people.</p>  <p>  The most recent Security Council meeting on Afghanistan took place on 26 January, and Ireland highlighted the urgent need for the international community to work collectively to address the dire humanitarian situation while noting that the crisis is of such a magnitude that it requires a broader and more sustained response. We will again emphasise the need for urgent action on the humanitarian situation when the UN Security Council meets to discuss UNAMA (the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan) later this week. I have also raised the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan in numerous bilateral meetings over the past few months, in particular in meetings with counterparts from other members of the UN Security Council and regional actors. </p></reply>

Over recent years, my Department has taken a proactive and strategic approach to advancing gender equality and wider diversity and inclusion issues. In 2012, a Management Board Sub-Committee focusing on diversity and inclusion issues, including Gender Equality was established, which brings together key stakeholders across the Department to provide leadership and strategic direction. </p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Strategy 2019-2022, a number of initiatives and policies have been advanced to improve gender, equality, diversity and inclusion. In 2019, a dedicated Lead Officer for Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion was appointed who co-ordinates work in this area across the Department. Through the Human Resources Strategy 2019-2022, as part of a wider Gender Equality Action Plan, my Department has published a Maternity Leave Cover Policy;  a Guide to Supports for Maternity, Adoptive and Parental Leave; and is finalising the adoption of a Menopause Policy, which is expected to be launched in Q2 2022. </p><p>Since 2019, my Department has published three reports on the Gender Pay Gap within DFA and in 2021 developed a Gender Pay Gap Action Plan. The Department of Foreign Affairs has reduced its Gender Pay Gap from over 30% in 2013 to 16.48% in 2020, and has made determined efforts to work towards a better gender balance at HQ and overseas positions. The next Departmental Gender Pay Gap report will be published in line with regulations to be introduced under the Gender Pay Gap Information Act, 2021.</p><p>Efforts towards ensuring greater gender balance at more senior levels is a key priority in the  Department.  As the end of 2021, the percentage of women at Principal Officer level and higher was 40 percent. In addition, of the 22 Ambassadorial and senior-level Head of Mission nominations for 2022, 11 are women and 11 are men. Including Consuls General appointed, 18 women will take up Head of Mission roles in 2022 out of a total of 31. Once all these appointments to bilateral and multilateral missions are in place in 2022, the percentage of female Heads of Missions will be 46%, up from 36% one year ago. As part of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the Gender Pay Gap, it led on the establishment of an inter-departmental working group on the Gender Pay Gap, which acts as an informal means of sharing best practice in the area of reducing the Gender Pay Gap and promoting Gender Equality.</p><p>More broadly, my Department is working to embed a culture of diversity and inclusion across the Department. In October 2020 and November 2021 the Department launched two surveys to gather the views of staff on how we can make further progress in this area. Combined, the results of these surveys will be used to develop a bespoke Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan and Training Programme, which will be both be finalised by the end of Q2 2022. </p><p>Gender Equality and the empowerment of women and girls is a key priority for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy, establishes gender equality as one of four core policy priorities. We are committed to integrating gender equality across all our interventions and in our wider foreign policy; and to increasing allocations to interventions directly dedicated to achieving gender equality. Ireland has a longstanding reputation as a leader on gender equality on the international stage. In 2018 and 2019, Ireland successfully chaired the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. Ireland is consistently ranked by the OECD DAC as among the OECD member countries with the highest gender equality focus in official development assistance (ODA). Gender features as a theme of the 2020 Irish Aid Annual report.</p></reply>

Our two countries share deep historic ties. Canada is home to millions of people who claim Irish heritage, and has both historic and new Irish communities. </p>  <p>  The Consulate General of Ireland in Vancouver was opened in 2018 in order to facilitate a further deepening of the political and economic relationships with Canada; to allow more effective servicing of the consular and other needs of a growing community of Irish citizens resident in western Canada; and to enhance diaspora engagement on the Pacific coast of the country. </p>  <p>  Last year was the Consulate&rsquo;s first full year of operation in its new premises in downtown Vancouver, during which the Consulate team worked to promote our close bilateral relations with Canada, and to support our citizens in British Columbia. Over the course of the year, more than 1,700 consular related queries, including 899 emails and 805 phone calls, were answered by the Consulate. </p>  <p>  In 2021 alone, the Consulate engaged in over 100 business meetings and events, both virtually and in-person. Flagship engagements included the virtual Brigid Festival Vancouver and CelticFest Vancouver, as well as the Consulate&rsquo;s own virtual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day reception. They also participated in the Hearts Beat Downtown Eastside Festival as part of continuing collaboration with the Indigenous community. </p>  <p>  This year the Consulate continues its valuable work to promote Ireland&rsquo;s interests and values in the region as set out in Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for the US &amp;amp; Canada 2019&ndash;2025. Ongoing activities include running a well-attended Business Breakfast on a near monthly basis; hosting a recurring parents and toddlers morning event; providing a workspace facility for Irish entrepreneurs; and creating an Irish book library. The Consulate is also working with the Irish community to explore the feasibility of establishing a Celtic Cultural Centre in Vancouver.</p>  <p>  The team are currently preparing a full programme for the visit of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael McGrath, T.D., for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day later this month.  </p>  <p>  The Consulate is staffed by two posted diplomats, and two locally engaged officers.</p></reply>

This service was launched in Dublin on 27 September 2021 and in Cork on 26 October 2021. The Urgent Appointment Service ensures that, for those who unexpectedly require a very urgent turnaround of a passport renewal, there is an option available that is transparent, predictable and clear. It means that an applicant can book and pay for their appointment, safe in the knowledge that they will have their passport within a day, or a few days. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin and within 4 days in Cork.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 appointments per week. To avail of the Urgent Appointment Service for Passport Renewal, applicants must first book an appointment to attend the public office in Dublin or Cork. Applicants can book an appointment through the Department of Foreign Affairs website (www.dfa.ie/passports)</p>  <p>  The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications. Over 90% of all passport applications are received through Passport Online. </p>  <p>  All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. Passport Online can also be accessed by first time applicants, irrespective of age in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service regrets that Passport Online experienced technical issues during the week of 24 January 2022. Despite these issues, over 32,000 applications were submitted via Passport Online that week.</p>  <p>  A scheduled system upgrade that has improved the responsiveness and efficiency of the system was completed on Friday, 28 January 2022. This upgrade has addressed the issues experienced by some customers. Since the upgrade was completed, Passport Online has been fully functional and operating smoothly.</p>  <p>  In cases where passport applicants submitted an application twice and incurred a second fee during the week of 24 January 2002, these applicants can receive a full refund for the first application by contacting the Customer Service Hub at (01) 6711633 or via Webchat on my Department's website (www.dfa.ie/passports).  </p>  <p>  My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.</p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

Expenditure under the Army Pensions Vote is essentially demand-driven and non-discretionary.

Such additional funding is met through the Supplementary Estimate process. In 2018, an additional &euro;3.5 million was required and in 2019, an additional &euro;1.9 million was needed.

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. In terms of fishery protection, the Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the EEZ. The Naval Service also carry out a number of other non-fishery related tasks in tandem with maritime surveillance, and as such any Naval Service patrol should be viewed as a multifaceted activity. </p><p>The number of Fishery Patrol and Non-Fishery Patrol days completed from 2016 to 2021 are detailed below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Fishery patrol days</th>       <th>Non-Fishery patrol days</th>       <th>Total Patrol days</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>1068</td>       <td>308</td>       <td>1376</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>1091</td>       <td>317</td>       <td>1408</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>1076</td>       <td>221</td>       <td>1297</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>1036</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>1061</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>781</td>       <td>226</td>       <td>1007</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>766</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>832</td>    </tr> </table> Scheduled patrol days can be impacted by a range of factors including adverse weather conditions and unscheduled maintenance, as well as staffing issues.  </p><p>At any one time the Naval Service can have a number of ships that are on active operations around the Irish EEZ whilst a number of others are undergoing routine resupply, maintenance and down time for ships companies. The high level of non-fisheries patrol days 2016-2018 can largely be attributed to the Naval Service's participation in Operations Pontus and Sophia in the Mediterranean during these years. </p><p>In July 2019, the Naval Service reduced its operational flotilla to six ships, placing two ships on operational pause, while a third ship entered a mid-life re-fit programme. The L&Eacute; Rois&iacute;n came back into operation last year following her mid-life re-fit, while the L&Eacute; Niamh has begun her mid-life re-fit following the fire on board in October 2020.  The reduction in overall Patrol Days 2020-2021 is mainly due to issues relating to Covid 19 as one of the ships, L&Eacute; Ciara, could not go to sea given its inability, due to its size, to implement safely the necessary Covid 19 'clean ship' precautions.  The fire on board the L&Eacute; Niamh also contributed to the reduction in scheduled Patrol Days in 2020. A shortage of suitably qualified and experienced personnel during the period in question was also a factor. I acknowledge these challenges have had an impact on overall planned Patrol Days. </p><p>Notwithstanding some mechanical and staffing issues being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations. My focus is on returning the Naval Service to its full capacity.</p></reply>

The Government, however, has committed to amending this Act and bringing both the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the scope of its provisions, where appropriate. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for preparing an appropriate legislative framework lies with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

A significant amount of work undertaken by civil and military management has determined that a high percentage of the normal everyday work of the Defence Forces is already in compliance and that a range of activities may also qualify for exemption. Legal interpretation of the Directive continues to evolve and recent case law relating to military service is also informing the deliberations of civilian and military management. It is understood that these deliberations are at an advanced stage and will feed into amendments to the legislative framework. </p>  <p>  The operational profile of Naval Ships is a security matter and details of operational routines cannot be discussed. That notwithstanding, the Officer Commanding of each ship has the authority and discretion to allocate rest periods to the ship&rsquo;s crew during operational deployments whilst maintaining operational readiness to respond as required. Ships crews are afforded rest and leave time during self-maintenance periods at the Naval Base whilst the ship is not operationally deployed.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the health and safety of personnel in the Defence Forces remains a priority for myself and the Chief of Staff and we remain fully committed to ensuring that the provisions of the Working Time Directive are applied throughout the Defence Forces.  </p></reply>

The new assessment arrangements under the Framework for Junior Cycle on the other hand require all students to engage in an assessment of their oral skills through Classroom Based Assessment.  This gives a greater opportunity for <b>all</b>students to develop and enhance their oral language proficiency skills over the three years of Junior Cycle and to foster their ability to use the Irish language. </p><p>With effect since 2017, as part of the Framework for Junior Cycle, Junior Cycle provision for Irish in post-primary schools and settings comprises two new specifications. The L1 (Language 1, in Irish, Teanga 1) specification is targeted at students in Irish-medium schools and students in English-medium schools who learn one or more subjects (apart from Irish) through the medium of Irish. The L2 (Language 2, Teanga 2) specification is targeted at other students in English-medium schools.  </p><p>The new specifications (both L1 and L2) have a strong emphasis on oral language.  This is particularly highlighted in the main strand of the specifications &ndash; Communicative Competence. This strand places an enhanced emphasis on Irish as the language of learning and communication in classrooms as well as an emphasis on the skills required to communicate effectively with other users of the language. Communication, opportunities for use and interaction are central to classroom tasks.  </p><p>The assessment of these skills forms an integral component of the overall language learning experience and occurs in a number of ways. As well as the completion of tasks where students use and demonstrate their oral language skills to achieve specific learning outcomes, their oral language skills are also formally assessed through the two new Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs). The second Classroom-Based Assessment in particular is entirely based on students&rsquo; oral language competence. The CBA is linked to ongoing classroom exchanges and represents a more authentic reflection of students&rsquo; interests and competence levels in Irish. Importantly, the oral skills of all students are now assessed in classroom-based assessments and formally reported upon in each students&rsquo; Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement.  Unlike the previous reporting format in which candidates receive one overall grade based on their achievement in Irish in the Junior Certificate, whether they undertake the optional oral or not, the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement allows students&rsquo; achievement in the CBAs to be recorded independently of the result in the state-certified examination.</p><p>These new arrangements provide a greater opportunity for students to develop their oral language proficiency skills.  </p><p>My Department remains committed to encouraging the use of spoken Irish.  The development of the new curriculum specifications for Irish at Junior Cycle was informed by research and extensive consultation with the education partners including practising teachers and students. Extensive continuing professional development (CPD) provided to teachers is complemented by a range of other supports. The new approach gives better recognition to the development of students&rsquo; oral competence, including their ability to speak Irish, over the three years of Junior Cycle.</p><p>As is the case with all of the specifications developed under the Junior Cycle Framework, an early enactment review of Junior Cycle Gaeilge is being conducted. The purpose of the review is to capture feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders on the early enactment of the Junior Cycle Irish L1 Specification and Junior Cycle Irish L2 Specification. The review addresses, among other issues, questions on how well the specifications get to the heart of the learning aspired to within Junior Cycle Irish, L1 and L2 and more broadly within the Framework for Junior Cycle. The review is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of this year. </p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in a number of school planning areas including in East Cork.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in East Cork to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can also be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p>  <p>  Specifically, in East Cork, there are a number of significant school building projects providing additional capacity at post primary level:</p>  <p>  - Carrigtwohill Community College (76333G) is a co-educational post primary school with an enrolment of 535 for the 2021/2022 school year.  A project to provide a permanent school building for 1,000 pupils is currently at Stage 3. </p>  <p>  - St Aloysius College, Carrigtwohill, (62140P) is an all girls post primary school with an enrolment of 792 for the 2021/2022  school year. A project to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.</p>  <p>  - Christian Brothers Secondary School Midleton (62360G) is an all-boys post primary school with an enrolment of 907 pupils for the 2021/22 school year.  A project to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils has been devolved to the school  authority for delivery.</p>  <p>  - St Mary&rsquo;s High School, Midleton (62380M) is an all girls&rsquo; post primary school with an enrolment of 758 pupils for the 2021/2022 school year. Temporary accommodation to allow the school to cater for 750 pupils has recently been approved and  this Department continues to engage with the school patrons in respect of a project for a new school building for St. Mary&rsquo;s High school to later for 1,000 pupils.</p>  <p>  - Pobailscoil na Trion&oacute;ide, Youghal, (91513S) is a co-educational post primary school with an enrolment of 1005 pupils for the 2021/2022 school year. A project to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,200 pupils has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.</p>  <p>  - Col&aacute;iste Mhuire, Cobh  (62180E) is a co-educational school which had an enrolment of 702 pupils  for the 2021/2022 school year. A devolved grant has been approved to the school to facilitate its expansion to cater for 700 pupils.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work to advance these and other projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient mainstream and SEN school places at both primary and post primary level.</p></reply>

This support was vitally important to ensure that our schools remained open for pupils. </p>  <p>   In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that a framework for adapted School Placement arrangements was developed by the Department of Education and the Teaching Council, together with the relevant Initial Teacher Education (ITE) providers, in order to ensure that student teachers at primary level could continue to support schools during periods of planned school placement from the beginning of January up to the February mid-term break. During this period, student teachers continued to be located in their host school for school placement, but were also available to support other schools where required. </p>  <p>  The Education Stakeholders, including the Department of Education, HEIs providing initial teacher education (ITE) and the Teaching Council, have continued to work together to maintain the integrity of the students&rsquo; ITE experiences and support students in satisfactorily completing their ITE programmes.</p>  <p>  The adapted School Placement arrangements were an exceptional measure introduced as part of a suite of measures to support schools to minimise the risk associated with COVID-19 and in light of the prevalence of the Omicron variant, with the understanding that these would be unwound as soon as possible. The Department understands that student teachers will now return to experiencing the more typical School Placement arrangements, and associated assessments, which are a critical part of their ITE programmes. </p>  <p>  While the adapted School Placement arrangements are no longer in place, student teachers will, if they wish, still be able to support schools by providing substitution cover when they have availability outside of their ITE programme requirements.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>On the 24th   February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome.</p>  <p>  The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.</p>  <p>  Secretaries may also choose to receive additional pay to ensure they no longer need to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. Proposals have also been made in relation to issues surrounding to annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for school secretaries who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and a generosity and willingness to come to the table to engage in discussion and find the pathway forward. This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries in our schools.</p></reply>

The Plan aims to ensure women and men are assigned an equal share of high visibility positions across the Department.  It also develops initiatives to support middle managers to ensure a strong female leadership pipeline for the future. It provides for unconscious bias training and ensures the organisational culture is supportive of work-life balance.  </p>  <p>  At the most senior levels, my Department has achieved gender balance on the Management Board with a 50/50 female: male composition.  54% of principal officers in my Department are female. The Department&rsquo;s involvement with the 30% Club has facilitated annual participation in the IMI 30% Club Network Mentor Programme to develop potential female senior leaders. The Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Unit also participates on the Gender Pay Gap Inter-departmental Working Group. My Department will shortly draft its new People Strategy which will contain further measures to build  and enhance existing equality objectives specifically in relation to women.</p>  <p>  Across the eleven state boards under the aegis of my Department, just over 53% of the total number of posts were held by women. In relation to the Government&rsquo;s target to achieve 40% representation of each gender on all boards, six of the eleven boards were achieving this target. Three of the boards had over 60% female representation and two had less than 40% female representation.  </p>  <p>  Within the national curriculum across all levels, a core value is inclusivity and diversity. The curriculum at all levels, is for all learners, from all backgrounds, regardless of gender, socio-economic background, race or creed. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s STEM Education Policy Statement 2017&ndash;2026 sets out the ambitious goals and actions required to achieve and improve the STEM education experience and outcomes for all learners. A Gender Balance group has been established to address the issue of gender balance in STEM, the barriers that exist, and to look to create inclusive educational experiences for all learners but with an initial focus on female participation in STEM. A Report &lsquo;Review of Literature to Identify a Set of Effective Interventions for Addressing Gender Balance in STEM in Early Years, Primary and Post-Primary Education Settings&rsquo; was published in November 2020.  This report sets out what is known about critical barriers to girls&rsquo; participation in STEM education and STEM learning, while also highlighting effective interventions to increase participation of girls in STEM. Following on from this report a set of recommendations have been developed and will be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department supports a number of actions in national inclusion strategies, including the National Women and Girls Strategy as led by the Department of Children, Equality Disability, Integration and Youth.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>On the 24th   February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome.</p>  <p>  The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.</p>  <p>  Secretaries may also choose to receive additional pay to ensure they no longer need to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. Proposals have also been made in relation to issues surrounding to annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for school secretaries who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and a generosity and willingness to come to the table to engage in discussion and find the pathway forward. This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries in our schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE plays a critical role in ensuring that policy and provision develops and evolves, so that students with special educational needs are helped to perform to their potential and achieve good education and life outcomes. Recruitment of administration and professional staff is carried out by the NCSE as provided for in section 25 (1) of the Epsen Act 2004.   </p>  <p>  At year end, 2021, the number of staff employed in the NCSE was 230. This is comprised of 141 employees in executive, administration, therapist and Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) posts, and 89 advisors &amp;amp; visiting teachers.</p>  <p>  As part of the annual budget preparation cycle, staffing requirements in the NCSE are addressed in the estimates process. The NCSE will be asked to review their current requirements and project the resource requirements anticipated for the next year, based on their programme of work. The projected requirements will be subject to detailed examination and review, by both the Department of Education and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform prior to sanction.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in  the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website: ncse.ie/for-schools</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website: www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website: www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;17.2 million in 2021 to all of these schools.</p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Circa. 96% of primary schools and 69% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those most in need. </p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1million provided under Budget 2020 was allocated to 102 Primary DEIS schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year.  This funding continued this for the 2021/22 school year. </p>  <p>  The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. It will continue to run for the 2021/22 school year and it&rsquo;s effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per student.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per student to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per student enrolled in the school.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>On the 24th   February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome.</p>  <p>  The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.</p>  <p>  Secretaries may also choose to receive additional pay to ensure they no longer need to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. Proposals have also been made in relation to issues surrounding to annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries presently. As set out in the framework agreement of 14 September 2021, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. Should the proposal be agreed and an implementation plan put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for staff who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and a generosity and willingness to come to the table to engage in discussion and find the pathway forward. This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries and caretakers in our schools.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 to additional schools.</p>  <p>  This package follows an extensive body of work which has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The refined DEIS ID model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index. It is important to note that there is no application process for the DEIS programme and all schools will be considered under the refined DEIS model when it is applied.</p>  <p>  In advance of the implementation of the refined DEIS identification model, there will be further engagement with relevant stakeholders. The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 1,023,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  The free travel scheme is a non-statutory scheme and is not governed by legislation.  Decisions in relation to applications for non-statutory schemes are made by Officers of my Department based on published guidelines setting out the conditions of entitlement in detail.</p>  <p>  Although establishment of a customer&rsquo;s entitlement to Free Travel is made on a non-statutory basis, delivery of Free Travel to customers is by way of a free travel token embedded in the customer&rsquo;s PSC, which the customer presents when availing of free travel on a range of public transport services.   </p>  <p>  The Department introduced the new Public Services Card Free Travel (PSCFT) in December 2013.  In excess of 94% of Free Travel customers have now registered for a PSCFT card. Whilst a small number of legacy paper passes remain in circulation, paper passes are no longer issued.</p>  <p>  This wide saturation of the PSCFT is having a hugely positive impact on travel operators&rsquo; ability to authenticate the identity and eligibility of Free Travel customers.  While no date has been fixed yet for the withdrawal of the paper free travel pass, discussions are ongoing.  </p>  <p>  In 2019 the Data Protection Commission (DPC) published a report on the processing of personal data in relation to SAFE registration and the issuing of PSCs.  In the report, the DPC stated that nothing in the findings made by the DPC impacts the validity or use by individuals of PSCs already issued and that nothing in the findings impacts existing free travel users or prevents DSP from processing and issuing further free travel variants of the PSC.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As with all other persons, farmers can avail of the State Pension (Contributory) scheme if they have sufficient PRSI contributions.  People on low incomes, including farmers, may alternatively qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory) (SPNC), which is a means-tested pension, financed by the Exchequer, and paid at up to 95% of the maximum rate of the SPC.  </p><p>The Farm Assist scheme was introduced in 1999 to provide income support for low income farmers.  It replaced the Smallholders&rsquo; Unemployment Assistance payment and did not entail any payment of self-employed PRSI contributions.  Recipients who had previously paid Class S social insurance contributions could, at that time, pay voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied the qualifying conditions to do so.  </p><p>Since 1st January 2007, the exemption from Class S PRSI has been removed and those self-employed persons receiving Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Farm Assist are subject to Class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.  Many low income famers qualify for the non-contributory State pension on this basis.</p><p>Low income farmers, on Farm Assist who don't, on reaching age 66, qualify for the contributory pension can take the option to retain the Farm Assist rate of payment if that is  higher than any amount that they would get on the non-contributory, or means tested, pension.</p><p>There are approximately 5,100 farm assist claims in payment at present.  Recipient numbers have been falling in recent years, partly due to the rising age profile of the customer base.  There are approximately 21% of current recipients aged 62 and over who will reach pension age in the next 4 years.  The numbers on the scheme are also dependent on the level of farm income.  </p><p>The Department is currently finalising a technical review of the means test disregards for the Farm Assist Scheme, in line with a commitment under the Programme for Government and in 'Our Rural Future, Rural Development Policy 2021 &ndash; 2025'.  </p><p>Any changes to social welfare supports, are considered in a budgetary context in view of the overall improvements to social welfare supports.  </p><p>I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Commission presented its report to Government late last year and unambiguously established that the current State Pension is not sustainable into the future and that change is needed.  It is a comprehensive and detailed report that takes account of responses to an extensive consultation process.  The report sets out a wide range of recommendations, including measures to increase Social Insurance Fund (SIF) income.</p><p>The report was referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  That Committee published its views on the 2nd February 2022.  </p><p>Separately, and as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system, including relevant PRSI rates and coverage recommendations, and I await its views.  </p><p>In parallel, I am working with my officials to examine each of the recommendations carefully and consulting with colleagues in Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  </p><p>I think it is very important that we get all the relevant views and complete our examination work before reaching conclusions on any specific aspect or recommendation.  Once that is done, I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government for its consideration by the end of March.</p><p>The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.

This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p><p>However, significant additional cost is not the only feature of the Deputy's proposal. Automatically awarding the fuel allowance payment to the cohort of people referred to by the Deputy would fundamentally change the nature of the scheme. The scheme would no longer be a targeted measure, as it would be awarded irrespective of a person's or a household's means. The measure would also result in multiple payments of fuel allowance in households that have more than one of the cohort of people referred to by the Deputy residing in them.</p><p>Any decision to extend the qualifying criteria for Fuel Allowance in the manner outlined by the Deputy could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p><p>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Spending on these payments in 2022 is expected to exceed &euro;1.5 billion. </p><p>The current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple. </p><p>In acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society I introduced a number of measures as part of Budget 2022 in relation to supports provided by my Department. These include the following changes to the carer means test which will take effect in June:  </p><p>- An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner,</p><p>- An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. </p><p>A more generous means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has been called for over successive Budgets by organisations representing carers.  An increase in the general weekly income disregard will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and therefore provide an income support to carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.</p><p>Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.  It also brings the capital formula applied to savings in the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in line with Disability Allowance.</p><p>Notwithstanding the increased level of support already in place for carers, my Department will keep these measures under review as part of the annual budgetary process.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My department has advanced the following important actions to meet the equality objectives in the Strategy and progress opportunities for women.  A number of strands of activity include income support, opportunities for and the protection of employment and pensions coverage.</p><p>Budget 2022 contained a range of measures which will contribute to the alleviation of poverty in families and in particular in female-headed households.  These include increases to</p><p>- the weekly rates of all working age payments (including One Parent Family Payment, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition payment and Maternity/Paternity/Adoptive/Parent&rsquo;s Benefit) and the State pension</p><p>- the weekly rates of payment for qualified children</p><p>- the income thresholds for the Working Family Payment for all family sizes</p><p>- both the income and capital means disregards for the Carers Allowance (in addition to the increase in the weekly payment rate)</p><p>- the annual Back to School Clothing and Footwear allowance, along with an adjustment to the weekly income limit for one parent families to bring it in line with two parent families.</p><p>My Department brought forward new legislation to protect women's employment rights before policy responsibility moved to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 delivered a commitment under the Programme for Government commitment to tackle increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious work. The Regulatory Impact Analysis on this legislation found that women are disproportionately represented in low paid sectors of the Labour market. As this legislation is targeted at the low-paid and precariously employed, the legislation has a positive impact on the employment rights of women. </p><p>Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Government&rsquo;s overall framework for activation and employment support policy, was published in July 2021.  The strategy contains five strands of action with &quot;Strand 4: Working for All - Leaving No one Behind&quot; extending targeted employment supports to groups facing additional challenges accessing work such as people with disabilities, lone parents and minority groups, including Travellers.  The strategy includes a commitment for the development of a Returner programme, to support people who have left the workforce and been out of the workforce for a period with a view to assisting their return to the workforce, to commence from early 2023.  The aim of a returner programme is to help women, in particular, to re-integrate into the workforce following an extended career break and will particularly benefit those with caring commitments.  </p><p>The Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) is a key policy initiative under the Government's new national employment services strategy - Pathways to Work 2021-2025.  WPEP is a funded work placement scheme to provide work experience for jobseekers who have been unemployed for more than six months, including time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP). To date, of the 195 placements approved, 112 (57%) are female, including six participants who are currently in receipt of either One Parent Family Payment or jobseekers transition payments.</p><p>The level of consistent poverty among lone parents stands  at 21.6%. In line with the 2020 Programme for Government commitment to prioritise and protect supports for lone parents and having regard to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection's Report on the Position of Lone Parents in Ireland (2017), the need to maintain income adequacy for lone parents is recognised as essential in order to successfully transition to employment and to avoid poverty.  As part of the Budget 2021 measures, the earnings limit of &euro;425 per week was removed in order to incentivise lone parents to work and to enhance the potential for increased work intensity.  This measure also aligned the earnings threshold between jobseekers transition and one parent family payments and offers a vital in-work support for those parenting alone, who are predominantly women.</p><p>In addition, the position of lone parents has been highlighted in another Pathways to Work commitment, recognising that their position is a key consideration. </p><p>Pension coverage for women is critical and, in particular, the aim is to reduce the gender pension gap that exists in Ireland. All pensions policy options continue to be examined from a gender perspective.</p><p>This is not an exhaustive list of measures advanced by my Department since the publication of the National Strategy on Women and Girls in 2017, but it is reflective of the level of commitment to improving the position of women in our society through income support, employment opportunities and pension coverage. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date expenditure on the scheme is over &euro;9.1 billion. </p><p>Flexibility has been provided to the self-employed to take up and receive payment for occasional or intermittent self-employment work while retaining their PUP. This measure has assisted people to maintain their business during the pandemic and provides that a person can earn up to &euro;960 from self-employment over a previous eight week period.</p><p>As a temporary measure in response to the pandemic, the Part Time Job Incentive, which was previously limited to employees only, was also made available to the self-employed. The extension of the scheme to the self-employed is targeted at a situation where a self-employed person exceeds the &euro;960 earnings threshold, having been in receipt of PUP. It is intended to support those re-opening their business, but who due to the pandemic could only do so intermittently or on a limited or reduced basis. </p><p>The scheme supports those working up to a maximum of 24 hours per week and provides a partial payment while retaining employment income. The rate of payment is a flat personal rate of &euro;131.80. There is no income limit applied.  The scheme is supporting approximately 1,300 self-employed.</p><p>In line with the gradual lifting of restrictions, the PUP has been closed for applications since 22<sup>nd</sup>January 2022 and the process of winding down the scheme continues.  With effect from 8 March 2022, anyone still in receipt of the PUP will move to a weekly rate of &euro;208. This represents a four-week extension on what had previously been arranged.  PUP recipients will start transitioning to standard jobseeker terms, and if eligible, will move onto a jobseeker payment from 5 April 2022. </p><p>It is intended that the Part Time Job Incentive scheme for the self-employed will run for as long as the PUP scheme is in operation. </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position at this time. </p></reply>

It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age will be able to apply for payments immediately when the scheme is in place.  The ex-gratia payment provides for 2 weeks pay per year of service or part thereof in the qualifying period.  The calculation will be based on the salary point of the CE supervisor or assistant supervisor on the date of retirement, subject to a cap of &euro;600 per week.</p>  <p>  The qualifying period for the scheme is from 1 July 2008 to 31 December 2023 and will apply to all periods of employment as a CE supervisor or assistant supervisor during that period. </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection is currently working on the administrative arrangements to implement the agreed settlement so that payments will issue to qualified CE workers in 2022. </p>  <p>   </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

There are some 970 people currently receiving it of whom 523 are aged 65 years or older. </p><p>The expenditure on heating supplement is provided for under the heading of &ldquo;other supplements&rdquo; which also include supplements such as travel and fuel. Provisional expenditure under these supplements was over &euro;4.0 million in 2021 and &euro;4.33 million has been provided for 2022.</p><p>Heating supplements are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme.  All the relevant circumstances of the case are taken into account in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  </p><p>While statistics are maintained on the number of recipients of heat supplement, the total number of recipients is not available for the period 2008-2010 and a breakdown by age is not available for the period 2008-2011.  Table 1 shows the total number of heating supplement recipients for the years 2011 to 2021 and those aged 65 years or older in each of the years 2012 to 2021.  </p><p>More generally, my Department also provides  discretionary Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) where appropriate to people who face difficulties in meeting fuel bills.  In 2021, over 2,300  exceptional needs payments totaling almost &euro;750,000 were made to assist with household bills and heating costs.  </p><p>Anyone who struggles with heating costs is entitled to make an application for a payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance schemes.  I would encourage them to contact the Community Welfare Service at their local Intreo Centre and, once they meet the eligibility criteria, they will be provided with additional financial support.  There is a national Income Support Helpline in place - 0818-800024 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p><p><b>Table 1: Total number of heating supplement recipients for 2011 to 2021 and for those aged 65 years or older in each of the years 2012 to 2021.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Total Number of Recipients</th>       <th>Recipients aged 65 years or older</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td>3,053</td>       <td>N/A</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>2,735</td>       <td>1,535</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>2,288</td>       <td>1,298</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>2,018</td>       <td>1,139</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>1,794</td>       <td>  982</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>1,665</td>       <td>  908</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>1,589</td>       <td>  851</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>1,398</td>       <td>  732</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>1,253</td>       <td>  646</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>1,123</td>       <td>  580</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>1,101</td>       <td>  569 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b></b></p></reply>

Strategy.</p>  <p>  The key role of the Department of Social Protection is to provide income support where an income need arises because of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  My Department provides a comprehensive package of carers&rsquo; income supports including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion. </p>  <p>  The Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main scheme by which my Department provides income support to carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested payment social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people whose disability is such that they require full-time care and attention.  The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2022 is approximately &euro;990 million.  </p>  <p>  In the case of a full-time carer who is caring for two or more people who require full-time care, the full rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance may be payable along with an increase of 50% of the full rate.  Carers may also, subject to certain conditions, qualify for the Household Benefits Package and a Free Travel Pass.   </p>  <p>  In terms of other forms of financial assistance available to carers to assist with additional expenses, the annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to family carers providing full-time care regardless of means.  The name was changed to better reflect the use of the grant and it can be used for a variety of purposes, including to pay for respite for the care recipient, to meeting heating costs, other household bills and travel expenses.  This grant is paid automatically to those in receipt of carer income supports, including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and will be paid on the first Thursday of June.  This grant is not available for any other group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.  Despite the extra financial demands due to the Covid-19 crisis, in Budget 2021, I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant by &euro;150 to its current rate of &euro;1,850.  This is the highest rate since its introduction.  The estimated spend on this grant in 2022 is over &euro;262 million. </p>  <p>  In the situation the Deputy outlines - that of a person who is providing full-time care for multiple    persons - it should be noted that in addition to the Carer's Allowance as outlined above, a full Carer's Support Grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for.  This is to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers.</p>  <p>  For those in financial difficulty, the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) is also available.  This is a means-tested payment available through the Department's Intreo Centres.  The SWA scheme is considered the "safety net" within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department may award a supplement to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and which are deemed to be necessary. </p>  <p>  I have also introduced a number of measures as part of Budget 2022 in relation to the income supports provided by my Department.  These include the following changes to the Carer's Allowance means test which will take effect in June: </p>  <p>  - An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  - An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 a week for single carers and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p>  <p>  In addition, the following changes also benefitting carers were announced and came into effect in January:</p>  <p>  - &euro;5 increase in maximum rate of all core weekly payments, with effect from January.</p>  <p>  - &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over and &euro;2 for those up to age 12, in all core weekly payment.</p>  <p>  I expect that these measures will go some way in improving the income supports to family carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.  However, any further changes to the carers payments as they are currently configured would have to considered in an overall policy and Budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  Finally, other supports for carers and people with disabilities, such as respite services and assistance with transport to and from appointments, are a matter for the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The HSE provides these services directly and also funds voluntary organisations to provide supports and services to individuals and their carers.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Regulations implementing the Act are currently being developed and it is anticipated these will be finalised and published in early 2022.</p>  <p>  Significant advances have been made in the provision of family leaves, including the extension of Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit to five weeks for each parent and extending entitlement to Adoptive Leave to fathers through the Family Leaves and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021. </p>  <p>  Parent's Leave and Benefit will be further extended to seven weeks for each parent from July of this year and I will also shortly bring to Government Heads of a Bill to give effect to some remaining aspects of the EU Work Life Balance Directive including the right of workers to Carers' Leave of five working days per year, and providing workers who are parents of children up to at least 8 years old, and carers under the Directive, with a right to request flexible working arrangements.</p>  <p>  Provision for maternity leave for Members of the Oireachtas is also under active consideration by my Department, and I hope to advance this work in 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is currently developing proposals for the introduction of Domestic Violence Leave to enable persons experiencing domestic violence to have time off work, including to attend court to secure orders against the person perpetrating such violence.</p>  <p>  Other, ongoing work includes the establishment of an Interdepartmental Network in 2021, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to fully implement gender and equality budgeting. The group will facilitate the embedding of the Equality Budgeting Initiative across all Government departments, and guide its continued progress. </p>  <p>  Looking to the future, the Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment that the Government will develop and implement a new National Strategy for Women and Girls. I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over the term of the National Strategy for Women and Girls and consider how we can develop a new Strategy which even more robust and effective. In this regard, my Department has commissioned a study to evaluate the processes for implementation of three equality strategies, which includes the National Strategy for Women and Girls as well as the Migrant Integration Strategy and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy. Consultations in regard to the successor strategy will commence during 2022, with work to build the new Strategy taking place in 2023.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

This group is led by my Department, and includes representatives from the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. The group meets on a regular basis, having held 8 meetings to date, whilst also progressing key pieces of work and liaising bilaterally between meetings. </p>  <p>  The Group's focus is on organisational and system readiness to support the provision of services under the proposed Birth Information and Tracing legislation. Included in the Group's work is the development of draft policy guidelines to support robust and consistent implementation of the legislation.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Implementation Group, the Department also engages with both the Adoption Authority and Tusla through regular governance and oversight meetings, where matters relating to the Birth Information and Tracing Bill are often discussed.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have strong working relationships with their counterparts in the Authority and Tusla.  This is central to the positive commitment and collaboration which is essential to successful implementation of the legislation in the interests of all those with questions on their origins.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I have met with the Chair of the Adoption Authority of Ireland on three occasions. These meetings have all included discussion of information and tracing. I meet with Tusla on a quarterly basis. Four of these meetings have taken place since July 2020. Issues relating to information and tracing legislation are discussed at these meetings as required.</p></reply>

This development is essential in facilitating an inclusive survivor-centred approach to the important work being advanced across Government.  Additional dedicated structures and resources will be introduced to support effective and sustainable stakeholder engagement and I will be bringing detailed proposals to Government in this regard.  I have advised Collaborative Forum members of my intention to meet with them again this month in advance of introducing new structures.</p>  <p>  Since my appointment, I have personally engaged with many survivors and their advocacy groups, including members of the Collaborative Forum. My Department has supported facilitated consultations in progressing the wide-ranging actions approved by Government in responding to the findings of the Commission. I am committed to ongoing engagement with survivors and their advocates in the context of this important work. </p>  <p>  I hosted two virtual meetings with Collaborative Forum members in February 2021 to share developments in the State&rsquo;s response to the Commission&rsquo;s report and to engage on matters of concern to members. The proposed new structure to support wider stakeholder engagement was also a specific agenda item. Further discussions on this issue were independently facilitated with Forum members and the Forum&rsquo;s feedback has assisted in refining the initial proposals. </p>  <p>  Separately, Collaborative Forum members have individually and collectively contributed to survivor focused consultations around specific initiatives, including the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Institutional Burials Bill and the Birth Information and Tracing Bill. In addition, the Forum had a dedicated session as part of the consultations with survivors on the Payments Scheme and Forum members are actively involved on the steering group for the NUIG research project examining language, terminology and representation.</p></reply>

This will start with a requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access new funding schemes in 2022.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 announced a series of measures to increase investment in ELC and SAC sector to &euro;716 million this year, including a one-off Transition Fund and a major new Core Funding stream.</p>  <p>  The Transition Fund will be available to ELC and SAC services from May to August inclusive, during the period between the ending of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) in April and the introduction of a new Core Funding stream in September. </p>  <p>  The contractual requirement for fees to remain at or below September 2021 levels is planned to come into effect in May 2022 with the provision of Transition Funding. This will be followed in September 2022 with Core Funding which will also have a contractual requirement that fees are not greater than September 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  The introduction of this requirement means that parents will not be faced with fee increases, and the full affordability effects of the NCS reforms announced in Budget 2022 can be fully realised.</p>  <p>  Providers who have increased their fees above September 2021 levels will be required to revert to September 2021 levels before May 2022 to be eligible for the Transition Fund in May 2022. Similarly, to be eligible for the new Core Funding stream, providers who have increased their fees above September 2021 levels will be required to revert to September 2021 levels before September 2022. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also confirmed that ELC and SAC employers will continue to benefit from the exemption to the turnover rule for the EWSS until April 2022, in part to avoid the additional costs arising from public health measures being passed on to parents.  </p>  <p>  The EWSS has been available to employers in the sector since August 2020.  Enhanced EWSS rates (from October 2020-January 2022) amount to approximately &euro;34 million per month for the sector, covering on average 80% of payroll costs and 50% of total operating costs for providers.  Standard EWSS (from August 2020-October 2020 and for February 2022) amount to approximately &euro;22 million per month for the sector, covering on average 50% of payroll costs and 38% of total operating costs for providers. A new EWSS flat rate of &euro;100 that will apply from March-April 2022 will amount to approximately &euro;11 million per month for the sector, covering on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs. </p>  <p>  In advance of May 2022, given the level of investment being made available to the sector through EWSS, it is difficult to see any justification for an increase in fees at this time.</p>  <p>  ‎‎Sustainability Funding also continues to be available to providers where there are sustainability difficulties and I have requested that providers would exhaust this route before considering increases in fees for parents. I encourage providers to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee if they require any further information or support. </p>  <p>  A Ready Reckoner to support services to determine the potential value of Core Funding will be available in early March along with further communications to the sector about the funding. </p></reply>

The CCCs and Pobal have previously engaged with services that were losing access to their current premises, to help them identify alternatives.</p>  <p>  Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering initial, and on-going, case management assistance. The CCC, where appropriate, will proceed to make a formal notification to Pobal who will provide more consolidated support while verifying the service&rsquo;s necessity for a financial intervention. All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.</p>  <p>  I understand that the relevant CCC has been providing support in the case in question.</p></reply>

I have also had the opportunity to participate in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and have considered carefully the submissions made by stakeholders during the pre-legislative process.  More generally, I have met with hundreds of survivors and persons affected by adoption, boarding out or illegal birth registration over the past year.  Through this engagement, I know that access to identity information is an urgent and priority need for many people and am committed to ensuring this access via the Birth Information and Tracing Bill.</p></reply>

In 2021, I made submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork City Council as part of the normal planning process in respect of two planning applications made on the current site associated with the former Mother and Baby Home institution in Bessborough, Cork City.  The application related to a particular part of the site which is identified on a 1950s Ordnance survey map as a burial ground and which campaigners consider to be the most likely location of burials. I  requested that due consideration be given to the sensitivity of these lands and the conclusions of the report by the Commission. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is Ireland&rsquo;s national independent planning body and that it is ultimately up to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and, where appropriate, the local council to grant or refuse permission to develop a particular piece of land.

Financial, human resources and payroll systems have been merged and information sytems integration continues with all staff on single MTU domain infrastructures. </p>  <p>  A change management programme is in place that includes the development of a  university strategy and organisational structure. Academic quality and corporate policies have been aligned and a programme of development of the policy framework continues.</p>  <p>  While Covid19 has had a significant impact during 2020/21, the creation of MTU has had a very positive reception my Department understands. It is a tribute to MTU staff, students and the wider community that the university has successfully completed its foundation year in 2021 and the university is projecting strong student number growth.</p>  <p>  Progress on MTU has included work on a number of Capital projects. These include a new Learning Resource Centre is planned for MTU Cork Campus. This will consist of classrooms, learning resource spaces, administration space and ancillary space.  In conjunction with decanted space elsewhere on campus, the new building will increase capacity of the institution by 1,000 students. </p>  <p>   A new  STEM building is planned for MTU Tralee Campus, consisting of labs, agri-machinery workshops, classroom spaces and ancillary space.  This will be built on the Institute&rsquo;s North Campus and represents an important step in the consolidation of the Institute on that site and will increase the capacity of the institution by some 440 students.  These two projects form part of Bundle 1 of the Higher Education PPP Programme.  </p>  <p>  In addition to this, &euro;18,750m has been approved under Project Ireland 2040 for an extensive upgrade and refurbishment of the main 1974 building on the MTU Cork campus.  This funding represents a key investment for Cork City and will further boost the role played by MTU as a driver of economic development in the southern region. This programme of works will be phased to minimise disruption to students and staff.</p>  <p>  Since 2020 MTU has received a total of &euro;12.8 million in Exchequer funding under the Transformation Fund which supports the development and progression of TUs nationally with &euro;4.22 million received by the university under its 2021 allocation. </p>  <p>  We are also working with MTU to develop proposals to accommodate students living on campus.  </p></reply>

Within this goal my Department is championing equality by: providing leadership; advocating equality and respect for all; supporting inclusive learning; working with research environments; promoting female leadership in academia and research; eliminating harassment; and promoting the principle of consent.</p>  <p>  The Senior Academic Leadership Initiative (SALI) is an important initiative aimed at advancing gender equality and the representation of women at the highest levels in our higher education institutions. I announced the results of cycle two of SALI in late November whereby seven of our institutions were successful in securing an additional 10 posts at senior academic level in higher education. This brings the total number of posts awarded under SALI to 30. </p>  <p>  Last May, I announced &euro;23 million in funding for a programme for post-doctoral researchers to become research leaders. The investment, which is a joint initiative between Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Irish Research Council (IRC), will see some 40 early career researchers, across all disciplines, supported to develop cutting-edge projects through awards of up to &euro;550,000 over a four-year period. The focus will be promoting women researchers in academia, in support of equality, diversity and inclusion across the higher education sector.  </p>  <p>The STEM Education Policy Statement was published in 2017 and seeks to raise awareness and interest in STEM and focuses on increasing the uptake of STEM related subjects for learners of all backgrounds, ability and gender. The strategy targets a 40% increase in the number of females taking STEM subjects for Leaving Certificate. On 18th   May 2021, Minister Foley and I announced a new partnership to support education and public engagement in STEM. This partnership contributes funding to projects under the Science Foundation Ireland Discover Programme. This programme aims to support effective interventions in early STEM education, help students engage with science subjects at an early age and foster interest in STEM careers especially among young women. This is an area that I have prioritised, including through support for initiatives including the National Gender Equality Dashboard for Higher Education Institutions; the Athena SWAN Charter and the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative which is increasing the number of women involved in decision making roles in higher education.   </p>  <p>  Tackling sexual violence and harassment in our tertiary education system is and will remain, a key policy focus for me and my Department. I really want to thank students and staff across the country who took the time to engage with two surveys in 2021 on Sexual Violence and Harassment within Higher Education Institutions and share their experiences with us. A total of 11,417 responses were analysed (7,901 students and 3,516 staff) and inform the findings.</p>  <p>  The survey findings point to some positive developments in the higher education institutions that can be built upon in areas such as awareness raising and education. But there are also some deeply troubling findings, such as the levels of sexual harassment experienced by staff and students that responded to the survey and particularly the female students that reported that they had experienced sexual violence. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in the HEA, the higher education sector and the HEA Advisory Group on Ending Sexual Violence and Harassment in Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) to implement the recommendations in these reports.</p>  <p>  Data from annual HEI progress updates to the HEA on implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs and the findings of the survey reports will provide an evidence base for any funding and priority areas identified in the reports&rsquo; recommendations. My intention is to develop an implementation plan to consolidate the advances that have been made in this area since the publication of the Framework for Consent in HEIs in April 2019. The HEA Advisory Group will act as the implementation oversight group, working alongside the HEA's Centre for Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion and my Department. </p>  <p>  I am also working with Cabinet colleagues to deliver on a number of Programme for Government commitments relating to gender equality. In this regard, my Department is actively involved in a number of cross Government initiatives such as the National Strategy for Women and Girls and the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence.</p></reply>

Indecon Economic Consultants, based on detailed engagements with stakeholders, concluded that the strategy has been extremely effective in achieving its overall objective. The review also comprised a full cost-benefit analysis on the value of international education to Ireland&rsquo;s economy, quantifying it at &euro;2.38 billion.</p>  <p>  The next strategy will be a high-level document setting ambitious yet achievable strategic goals and objectives to 2025. As all sectors involved in international activities were deeply impacted by the pandemic, the new strategy will play a key role in the recovery of Ireland&rsquo;s international education, research and innovation sectors, and will provide a framework on which to develop and strengthen existing and new relationships.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science offers the opportunity to bring the international education strategy and the research and innovation strategy together in an aligned framework. This, complemented by the Indecon Review and wider public policy developments, provide the basis for the key drivers informing the new strategy. </p>  <p>  In February, my Department launched a consultation process to inform the next iteration of its International Education, Research and Innovation (ERI) Strategy. The Indecon review was published alongside the consultation paper. </p>  <p>  The consultation process remains open until 23 March and I would encourage all interested parties to engage constructively in the process.  I want to see build on the success of the previous strategy, developing existing and forging new links between our educational providers, business and the research community with a view to improving the experience of all stakeholders including students and their learning experience. </p>  <p>  Work on the strategy is ongoing and consideration and analysis of the outcome of the consultation will help inform the finalised report. It is envisaged that the new Strategy document will be completed later this year with publication to follow as soon as is practicable. </p></reply>

These providers use the tools of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and related QQI policies as key supports for the operation of RPL. The awards made as a result of RPL use the same standards as formal qualifications.</p>  <p>  QQI&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2022-2024 contains a commitment to conducting an evaluation of provider adherence to a national approach to access, transfer and progression and the appropriate recognition of prior learning.  During the timeframe for this Strategy QQI plans to develop a discussion paper on Ireland&rsquo;s approach to RPL which will comprise a review of current RPL policy and practice and encompass a series of engagements with key national and European stakeholders.  The objective of this work is to develop updated guidelines for RPL for education providers.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that there is currently an RPL in Higher Education Project underway which is being funded through the Human Capital Initiative Pillar 3 to the amount of &euro;6.9 million.  This project is a collaboration between the Universities, the Technological Universities and the Institutes of Technology. Its aim is to build a consistent and coherent approach to RPL within and across the entire public higher education sector. The project is running from 2020 to 2025.  Further information is available at: RPL Landing Page (priorlearning.ie).</p></reply>

The scheme was introduced in 2015 and provides supports along similar lines to the current Student Grant Scheme (the SUSI scheme) to eligible applicants who are in the protection system and who are either:</p>  <p>  - asylum applicants</p>  <p>  - subsidiary protection applicants</p>  <p>  - leave to remain applicants</p>  <p>  Following a review in 2020 I approved positive changes to the scheme to widen access for those in the international protection system. The requirement for prospective applications to have attended three academic years in the Irish school system and to have obtained the Leaving Certificate in the State was removed. The criteria to retain the requirement to have a combined period of three years or more in the protection process or leave to remain stage was retained as this requirement is along similar lines to the statutory based SUSI scheme which requires prospective applicants to have three out of five years residency.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2021 the scheme was further expanded to allow eligible applicants to undertake postgraduate courses of which officials in my Department confirmed they received 9 applications. To date 3 postgraduate students have been awarded grant support.  These positive changes resulted in a fivefold increase in the number of applications and more eligible applicants to the scheme. Between 2015 and 2019 only 11 applicants were eligible for support compared to 75 in the following 2 years since the aforementioned changes to eligibility criteria were made. </p>  <p>  A total of 40 students were awarded grant support in 2020/2021 at a cost of  &euro;253,038.  A further 35 students were awarded grant support in 2021/2022 and estimated spend for this cohort is circa &euro;220,000. This contrasts greatly with the average spend between 2015 and 2019 of circa &euro;13,000 on the scheme.</p>  <p>  In March 2021, myself and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (D/CEDI+Y) jointly announced that, international protection applicants with permission to work, will no longer be required to pay the international student fee of &euro;3,600 to access Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) education courses.</p>  <p>  Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses are full-time programmes for young people who have completed their Leaving Certificate and adults returning to education. The course lasts one to two years and leads to an award on the National Framework of Qualifications at NFQ Level 5 or NFQ level 6. The courses develop technical and practical skills for an industry recognised qualification. They also offer an alternative route to higher education.</p></reply>

As an employer, the Department is guided by the Civil Service Diversity Policy and its obligations under equality legislation, particularly the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015, which outlaw discrimination in a wide range of employment and employment-related areas, including recruitment and promotion; equal pay; working conditions; learning opportunities; dismissal and harassment including sexual harassment.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department's Gender Pay Gap Report will be launched next Tuesday, March 8, at a special staff event to mark International Women's Day 2022. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 places a positive duty on public sector bodies to have regard for the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality, and protect the human rights of employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans. This is known as our &lsquo;Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty&rsquo;. My Department established a dedicated Equality, Diversity, Inclusion and Public Sector Duty Committee to oversee our adherence to the public sector duty and to devise, oversee and promote equality, diversity and inclusion for my Department. </p><p>Through its day to day work, my Department continues to value and promote equality and human rights, whether in delivering key public services, developing policy and legislation in an inclusive human rights compliant manner, or in doing our work in an efficient, fair manner with integrity and respect for human dignity. </p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy is due to be published this month and will be central to our mission of working for a safe, fair, inclusive Ireland, and to fulfilling our public sector duty obligations.</p><p>The development of the Strategy involved broad consultation with our internal stakeholders as well as engagement with external stakeholders with an expertise in human rights and equality issues.  The objectives of our EDI Strategy will focus on: achieving better policy outcomes and improving the accessibility and quality of our services; supporting the development of a skilled and diverse workforce and building and embedding a workplace culture which facilitates &amp;amp; encourages contributions from all. </p><p>My Department is leading the development across Government of the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV), with valued input from victims and survivors as well as those working in the frontline.  The new Strategy recognises that while both men and women can be victims/survivors, women and girls are affected disproportionately as a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women. As a result, there is an emphasis within the Strategy on meeting the needs of women and girls.</p><p>The Strategy will be underpinned by clear actions, timelines, effective governance and accountability mechanisms. It will be resourced as it should be, and its goal is clear: zero tolerance in Irish society for domestic, sexual and gender based violence.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I intend to publish a Bill before Easter which will create new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation. A new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender, will be published in the summer.  This will mean that certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.</p><p>I am continuing to drive forward the implementation of Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, which is a detailed action plan for delivering all of the 52 recommendations made in the O&rsquo;Malley report. This will make our criminal justice system one that better protects and supports vulnerable victims. To date, a number of key actions have been delivered, including:</p><p>- The introduction of Preliminary trial hearings;</p><p>- Work to advance specialist training for legal professionals and all who will come into contact with a victim is underway;</p><p>- The nationwide rollout of Divisional Protective Services Units and the establishment of a new sexual offences unit in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions;</p><p>- A number of legislative reforms are also being advanced, and,</p><p>- Increased funding has been provided to frontline service providers to address the gaps in service provision identified on foot of a review undertaken.</p><p>I am pleased with the progress made to date in delivering on Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, and will continue to prioritise this vital work. </p></reply>

The Constitution obliges the State to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing, or if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.</p>  <p>  The overriding concern is to ensure that due process is followed and that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of a person charged with a criminal offence before the courts.</p>  <p>  The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and as such are handled by the judiciary on the applicant's appearance in court. Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and if satisfied it is so warranted, the District Court Judge presiding will grant a criminal legal aid certificate.</p>  <p>  There is no limit to the number of times that a person can be granted legal aid under the scheme. Whether or not an applicant has received legal aid previously is not a consideration in determining eligibility for legal aid and this information is not recorded by the Courts Service. An applicant's previous convictions are also not a criterion for the granting of criminal legal aid under the Act.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of legislation to amend and update the law in respect of criminal legal aid is being prepared and I intend to publish it later this year.</p>  <p>  The key purpose of the General Scheme will be to transfer the administration of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to the Legal Aid Board and consultation with relevant stakeholders will be undertaken once work on the draft General Scheme is completed.</p>  <p>  The new Scheme will involve a transfer of accountability for Criminal Legal Aid expenditure to the Legal Aid Board. Among other things, the Scheme will also provide for better oversight and improved accountability for expenditure, management and control in line with Audit requirements. It will also provide for the implementation of a simple and transparent application system for Criminal Legal Aid and provide for a comprehensive body of regulations to support the administration of the amended Scheme. In the main this will be part based on existing regulations, updated as necessary.</p></reply>

The Prison Service has examined a number of options including accommodation in the Grove area to incentivise participation in constructive activities and prison-based therapeutic interventions to enhance public safety on release.</p>  <p>  The Grove Area in Castlerea was selected for a number of reasons including access to services, its location away from the main prison and for other security and operational reasons.</p>  <p>  A Standard Operating Procedure has been developed to allow for the selection and transfer of prisoners who are ready for step down procedures in sentence management plans but are not deemed suitable for an Open Centre.</p>  <p>  Prisoners who wish to be considered for a transfer to the Grove must meet a set of clearly defined criteria including inter alia, completion of all risk relevant interventions identified in their sentence plan, be drug free, be on enhanced regime and have no disciplinary reports for a period of 3 months prior to the date of anticipated placement within the Grove. This incentivisation of engagement augments sentence planning and better identifies a pathway of interventions to address dynamic risk factors known to be associated with sex offending. Their case must also be considered at a multi-disciplinary meeting prior to any transfer being approved.</p>  <p>  It is the intention of the Irish Prison Service to continue to develop this pathway for prisoners convicted of a sexual offences, subject to its ongoing review.</p></reply>

Initially an extensive review will be conducted on all relevant age-related strategies, with any gaps addressed through a collaborative process with a variety of stakeholders. Approaching the review from the bottom up is an opportunity to strengthen older person policies and strategies in the areas of COVID-19, Gender, Mental Health, Disabilities, and Marginalised communities. This initial review will ensure that the needs of communities across Ireland are accurately reflected in the Terms of Reference and subsequent work of the commission.</p>  <p>  Alongside this Commission on Care, I am also committed to establishing a cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine strategic workforce challenges, including recruitment and retention of workers, in front-line carer roles in home support and nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The work of the Strategic Workforce Advisory Group will centre on engagement with the relevant stakeholders in the sector. To this end, a 'Call for Submissions' was issued by my Department to relevant stakeholders in December 2021. Following receipt of these completed submissions in January, my Department undertook a short-life scoping exercise to gather initial data and evidence on the nature and extent of the challenges in the sector to inform the structure and membership of this cross-departmental Group.</p>  <p>  This scoping exercise is now complete and invitations to join the Group, along with its draft Terms of Reference, have been issued to all relevant Government Departments and agencies. The inaugural meeting of the Group will be held on Thursday, 3rd March 2022.</p>  <p>  At this meeting, the Terms of Reference for the Group and action timelines will be agreed. These Terms of Reference will be published once finalised by the Group.</p>  <p>  This Group will then progress a structured programme of ongoing consultative engagements with key sectoral stakeholders to further explore and define the issues, listen to stakeholder views, and identify approaches to respond to the strategic workforce challenges.</p>  <p>  The Group will provide a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address the workforce challenges in the sector and develop a report for my consideration outlining the Group&rsquo;s key findings, recommendations, and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations to include periodic monitoring of progress.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites. The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices (eg: nursing homes and hospices that are private, public, section 39, voluntary etc.) that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p></reply>

Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP. As of February, there are approximately 28 GMS vacancies in the State, approximately 1 percent of all GP GMS panels, and currently no GMS vacancies in County Kildare.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement on GP contractual reforms will see the Government increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021. The transfer of responsibility for training to the ICGP, completed last year, will result in further increases in the coming years.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-01a.1652.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100098#WREE01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 636 to 638, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in their first year of secondary school. </p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school. HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys. This started in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. </p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. As part of the HTA to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys, it also examined the potential for a catch-up programme for boys up to sixth year in school. It concluded that such a programme would not be cost effective, and it was not introduced at that time. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  In July 2018, NIAC recommended the HPV vaccine for people living with HIV up to and including 26 years of age and for all gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM), including gbMSM living with HIV, up to and including 45 years of age.  A policy decision was made to implement this recommendation and the vaccine is available through many STI and HIV clinics.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware, my Department has asked NIAC to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p>  <p>  If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p>  <p>  Once this work has been completed, my Department will consider the recommendations made by NIAC and HIQA following which my Department will make future policy decisions in this area.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of NIAC recommendations more generally, I can advise that currently, there have been no decisions made to extend the HPV national immunisation programme to include those receiving treatment for CIN2+ lesions on foot of the NIAC recommendation.  My Department will, of course, continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence in the future.</p>  <p>  In relation to HPV vaccine uptake rates, the National Immunisation Office have advised that the latest available figures show a 76% uptake for dose 1 and 65% uptake for dose 2 in the 2020/2021 academic year.  It should be noted that some areas are yet to input some, or all, of their data for both dose 1 and 2 so these figures are expected to increase.</p>  <p>  The World Health Organisation has a HPV uptake rate target in place of 90% to eliminate cervical cancer. I can confirm that Ireland is committed to achieving this objective of a 90% uptake rate.  </p></reply>

The NIMC is made up of the NIMC Steering Committee, supported by a NIMC Reference Group of Service Users and Family Members, which is in the process of being established, and NIMC Specialist Groups, which have been established in priority areas of development including CAMHS, Acute Inpatient Bed Capacity development and also in Women&rsquo;s Mental Health. </p>  <p>   There is work ongoing across Government that aligns to the recommendations of Sharing the Vision. I am satisfied that the Committee is progressing well in this initial stage of its work, by building on the following initiatives already underway: </p>  <p>  -   Many significant recent developments in online mental health service provision and positive mental health promotion have been expedited in response to the ongoing pandemic. These initiatives exemplify the holistic, whole-of-population approach to mental health service development that Sharing the Vision  promotes and seeks to advance, in parallel with the development of specialist supports. </p>  <p>  -   Sharing the Vision recommends the continued phased implementation and evaluation of existing national clinical programmes in mental health, including Dual Diagnosis, Early Intervention in Psychosis, and Eating Disorders. The clinical programmes, which are in various stages of design and implementation, are at the heart of service improvement. </p>  <p>  -   Sharing the Vision additionally recommends that, in keeping with the evolving understanding of human rights to empower people and improve quality of care in mental healthcare facilities, legislation must be updated and additional supports put in place. This is currently being addressed in the review of the Mental Health Act, 2001, which was completed, and a General Scheme approved by Government on 13 July 2021. Following the Government decision to approve the heads of bill, a formal Bill will be drafted by the Office of the Attorney General, in consultation with the Department of Health. </p>  <p>  The policy rollout will be further enabled by the Sharing the Vision Implementation Plan 2022 &ndash; 2024, which is presently being finalised for publication in March 2022. Developed in collaboration with key stakeholders, the Plan will provide detailed 3-year plans for each of the policy&rsquo;s 100 recommendations, is the next step in ensuring the continued momentum needed for a successful policy implementation. Additionally, HSE National Service Plan 2022, which is currently being finalised, will set out a plan to enhance mental health services in the short term, on the basis of the priorities set out in Budget 2022 and in line with Sharing the Vision.</p>  <p>  With regards to funding, a total of &euro;1.149 billion has been allocated to mental health in Budget 2022. This is an additional &euro;47 million for next year and comprises &euro;24 million for new developments, &euro;13 million for existing levels of service and &euro;10 million in once off funding for COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The additional investment provided for in Budget 2022 will ensure the continued development of mental health services, including out of hours supports, child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and the national clinical mental health programmes. An additional &euro;1.15 million will be allocated to the Clinical Programme on Eating Disorders to continue the roll out of specialist eating disorder teams in CHOs 1, 3, 5 and 6. New mental health services for older people will be developed, in line with the model of care for specialist mental health services for older people and will be piloted next year. Two new CAMHS telehubs will be funded under Budget 2022 and funding will also be allocated to enhance the capacity of CAMHS teams across the country. Crisis resolution teams will continue to be developed with an allocated budget of over &euro;1.4 million in 2022.  An additional &euro;10 million was announced on Budget Day as a once off funding measure to provide further investment in mental health services, with a particular emphasis on community and voluntary based supports.  </p>  <p>   As the question also concerns HSE services, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  In addition, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, it should be noted that this Department keeps medical card issues such as existing income thresholds under regular review, having regard for Government policy, increases in the Consumer Price Index and other issues which may be relevant.</p>  <p>  Separately, since 2015 every individual aged 70 and over has automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.</p></reply>

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects. </p>  <p>  Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur. </p>  <p>  The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT), notably transdermal patches. The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT products, Estradot, has increased by between 77% and 117% for, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of Estradot in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.</p>  <p>  The suppliers have confirmed that they have increased supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. In the interim, the companies have indicated that they are working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues. </p>  <p>  The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within our regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised the companies that we are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. We are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.</p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved. </p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Health Insurance Authority submits an annual review of the market which provides the Minister for Health with a recommendation as to the risk equalisation credits to be applied each year based on market trends. In the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2021, the amount of stamp duty on health insurance contracts was reduced as a surplus of &euro;100 million had built up in the Risk Equalisation Fund due to lower hospital utilisation during the Covid-19 pandemic. It should be noted that the stamp duty on health insurance contracts does not accrue to the Exchequer but is prospectively calculated so that it will all be paid out as risk equalisation credits.</p>  <p>  The operation of the Risk Equalisation Scheme is carefully considered by officials in my Department, and is approved as part of a negotiation process with the European Commission. As such, the parameters of the Risk Equalisation Scheme including the stamp duty and risk equalisation credits are kept under constant review.</p>  <p>  I hope this information has answered the Deputy's query.</p></reply>

However, as restrictions are beginning to ease, the Department is currently reviewing whether remote consultation as part of a blended approach to termination of pregnancy care should be continued post the COVID-19 public health emergency period.

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites. The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices (eg: nursing homes and hospices that are private, public, section 39, voluntary etc.) that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  There are many, many other individuals and organisations in our country who did so much during the pandemic. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the exceptional risks which these frontline healthcare workers faced.</p></reply>

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7. My officials and the HSE are already engaged in preparatory work, and I expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the IMO, representing GPs, later this quarter, after which engagement can commence with the IMO. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

It takes a life course approach, acknowledging the importance of developing a healthy attitude to sexuality in young people and of building on that foundation for positive sexual health and wellbeing into adulthood and older age.  </p>  <p>  Current priority deliverables under the Strategy are HIV prevention, including the continued expansion of a Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) programme, which commenced in late 2019, and the HIV Fast Track Cities programme, involving Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.</p>  <p>  Other key areas of work include expanding access to contraception, free of charge, through the National Condom Distribution Service; expanding sexually transmitted infection (STI) services, progressing a population survey on sexual health and improving sexual health education, training and resources, including in schools, higher and further education.</p>  <p>  A review of the Strategy began in 2021, having been postponed as a result of the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Focus group meetings were held with key stakeholders, including clinical and public health staff, the Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme team, those working in the STI clinics, the education sector, the Department of Health and Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, the research and academic sector and organisations representing the LGBTI+ community. </p>  <p>  The detailed feedback from these meetings has been collated and will inform the future direction of the next iteration of the strategy. An external review of the Strategy has been approved and will progress, following a standard procurement process. Once the results of the Review are available, drafting of a refreshed version of the Strategy will commence in Q3, 2022 with completion of the Strategy envisaged in Q4, 2022</p></reply>

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with further increases planned. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.</p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas.</p>  <p>  The involvement of stakeholders in considerations of how best to ensure that general practice can continue to deliver a high-quality, accessible, and sustainable service to patients will be essential.  The ICGP has made and will continue to make a vital contribution to the delivery of general practice in this country, and my Department has a strong record of working with them.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 Agreement with GPs, we plan to undertake a strategic review of general practice. Preparatory work has commenced on this, and I have asked officials to provide me with a proposal for taking the substantive work forward before the end of this quarter.  I anticipated that the ICGP will have an important contribution to make to that review.</p></reply>

As Minister with responsibility for this area I have prioritised home support services so that additional funding secured in Budget 2021 to provide an extra 5 million hours has been maintained under Budget 2022. It is estimated that in 2021 some 20.4 million hours had been provided to over 55,000 people. This is about 2.9 million more hours compared to 2020, an increase of 17%.</p>  <p>  It takes some time between funding approval and the actual delivery of home support hours. Certain regions are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability. At the end of December there were 5,322 people assessed and waiting for a carer to become available. A further 474 people were waiting for funding approval. To address this, the HSE is endeavouring to prioritise service for clients with the highest care needs, to ensure that the service can commence for those who require it most urgently.  It is important to note that progress is being made in this area, and that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to approximately 5,796 by the end of December 2021.</p>  <p>  In relation to issues of recruitment and retention, I am committed to establishing a cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group, to examine strategic workforce challenges in front-line carer roles in home support and nursing homes.   </p>  <p>  The work of the Strategic Workforce Advisory Group will centre on engagement with the relevant stakeholders in the sector.  To this end, a 'Call for Submissions' was issued by my Department to relevant stakeholders in December 2021.  Following receipt of these completed submissions in January, my Department undertook a short-life scoping exercise to gather initial data and evidence on the nature and extent of the challenges in the sector to inform the structure and membership of this cross-departmental Group.</p>  <p>  This scoping exercise is now complete and invitations to join the Group, along with its draft Terms of Reference, have been issued to all relevant Government Departments and agencies.  The inaugural meeting of the Group will be held on Thursday, 3rd March 2022.</p>  <p>  At this meeting, the Terms of Reference for the Group and action timelines will be agreed. These Terms of Reference will be published once finalised by the Group.</p>  <p>  This Group will then progress a structured programme of ongoing consultative engagements with key sectoral stakeholders to further explore and define the issues, listen to stakeholder views, and identify approaches to respond to the strategic workforce challenges.</p>  <p>  The Group will provide a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address the workforce challenges in the sector and develop a report for my consideration outlining the Group&rsquo;s key findings, recommendations, and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations, to include periodic monitoring of progress.</p></reply>

This was enabled in circumstances where:</p>  <p>  - it is the professional judgement of the pharmacist that it is safe, appropriate, and necessary for the continued treatment of the person for a further supply to be made, AND</p>  <p>  - it is unreasonable at the time for the person to obtain a new prescription.</p>  <p>  The amendments in April 2020 also introduced the electronic transfer of prescriptions, whereby an electronic version of a new prescription may be transmitted from the prescriber to a pharmacy of a patient&rsquo;s choice. This mechanism also facilitates individuals to obtain an up-to-date prescription and to enable the pharmacist to continue to dispense their prescription(s).</p>  <p>  In light of the prolonged nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, the temporary provisions introduced have not yet been revoked and continue to apply. </p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that none of the temporary amendments impose a duty on a prescriber to issue a prescription beyond a period they consider to be clinically appropriate, or on a pharmacist to dispense any prescription where they do not consider it safe, appropriate and necessary for the continued treatment of a person for a further supply to be made without a new prescription issued by the prescriber.</p></reply>

The challenges presented by Covid-19 have given extra urgency to the need to address the long-term workforce planning needs of the health system. It is critical that we continue to attract, train, and retain sufficient appropriately qualified healthcare workers to ensure the health service can meet the projected future demand for healthcare.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department engage on an ongoing basis with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science on determining the longer-term skills needs of the healthcare sector, and the role which the Further and Higher Education sector can play in meeting those skills needs. It is recognised by both Departments that there is a need to ensure the availability of graduates with the skills necessary to support the healthcare system and to support a strategic approach to workforce planning for the health sector. </p>  <p>  The Department is engaging with DFHERIS regarding the number of places in health disciplines including medicine, nursing, health and social care professionals including Occupational Therapists, Speech and Language therapists, Psychologists, Physiotherapists, Social Workers, Medical Scientists, Dieticians.  These are high priority areas for the HSE in the context of delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme and where the HSE has identified significant skills shortages.</p>  <p>  DFHERIS officials are currently engaging with the Higher Education Authority and representatives from the higher education sector on the provision of additional places for the coming academic year, with a focus on areas such as healthcare where there is a need for more skilled graduates.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will continue to engage with officials in other Government Departments, the HSE, regulatory and professional bodies to ensure that there are sufficient undergraduate places across the health system to address skills shortages and meet the future workforce needs of the health sector.</p></reply>

The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement an elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Department of Health and Health Service Executive, has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code. Following the approval of the new National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy, Programme level and Project level Preliminary Business Cases for the three locations are being finalised for consideration and review by my Department. If approved internally, the Business Cases will be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s recently introduced PSC External Assurance Process (EAP) and Major Projects Evaluation after which further memoranda for Government could then be brought forward. While it is difficult to be absolute about timelines, following these assurance steps I am hopeful we could proceed to approval-in-principle (Gate 1 of the Public Spending Code) in the coming period ahead.</p></reply>

The Group have reported that they are continuing to deal with high volumes of patients attending University Hospital Limerick Emergency Department, a pattern that has been sustained over a number of months and is being replicated around the country.

Funding of approximately &euro;9m has been allocated in Budget 2022 to enable commencement of the scheme, which is still scheduled for August 2022.</p><p>In terms of both expert and stakeholder consultations, it should be noted that the recommendations of the JOC8 took into consideration the deliberations of the Citizen&rsquo;s Assembly on the matter. The Working Group on Contraception held a number of meetings with key stakeholders, including experts, as part of its research, prior to publication of the Report.</p><p>More recently, my Department has held consultations and listening exercises with a large range of stakeholders, as part of the wider work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce and, separately, as part of wider work to review the National Sexual Health Strategy. </p><p>It should be noted that the stakeholder meetings carried out in 2021 regarding the National Sexual Health Strategy included a wide range of input from the HSE, including key clinicians, and from the academic sector. Expanding access to contraception, as per the Programme for Government commitment, was a key element of feedback. </p><p>Ongoing engagement with the HSE and medical representative organisations will be required for implementation, roll-out, evaluation and monitoring of the scheme; needless to say, these engagements will include input from clinicians and other relevant experts. Clear stakeholder and expert feedback with regard to access to contraception is therefore duly taken into consideration in the development and progression of this scheme.</p></reply>

The target for 2022 is to issue 850 forest road works licences which will be more than sufficient to enable the haulage of timber from the forest estate when added to the existing roads already approved or installed in Irish forests.  This represents an increase of 27% on the road licences issued in 2021. </p><p>In February 2020, Section 8 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 was commenced and the Forestry (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 2020 (SI No. 39 of 2020), were signed.  This legislation made provision for my Department to act as the single consent authority for applications for forest road works licences, where the forest road provides access to a public road (other than a national road) or there is material widening of an existing entrance.  Forest owners wishing to carry out such works no longer require a grant of planning from their local authority.</p><p>To 25<sup>th</sup>February 2022, the Department received 452 forest road works applications, under the single consent process. 217 of these applications are awaiting a decision.</p></reply>

This includes greater integration between the measures in the National Forestry Programme and the Common Agriculture Policy. </p>  <p>  However, the inclusion of small-scale tree planting measures in schemes is constrained by the 0.1ha size limit imposed by the forest definition in the Forestry Act 2014. </p>  <p>  Key to the success of increasing afforestation rates is to build confidence among landowners of the benefits of forestry as a viable option to complement existing enterprises. Introducing an exemption for the afforestation in certain circumstances facilitates the exclusion of clearly defined activities from requiring an afforestation licence. This exemption is an enabling proposal that allows forests to be created through initiatives, other than the afforestation scheme, thereby contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s targets in relation to a wide range of environmental priorities particularly climate change, biodiversity and water quality. </p>  <p>  These proposed changes are being introduced as part of the Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, which will allow the Minister to make Regulations to facilitate small scale planting of native tree areas without the need to first obtain an afforestation licence. This Bill has progressed through all stages in the legislative process in the Dail and is currently before the Seanad for Committee Stage debate. There are no metrics included in the licensing plan as the legislation must still be passed by the Oireachtas.   </p>  <p>  Importantly, the requirement to comply with environmental law is not undermined by making this change as all works are controlled by regulation through a Departmental scheme. The development of a scheme will be undertaken following the completion of the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment, subject to the findings of both assessments. Eligibility criteria will be incorporated into the scheme which will ensure that all tree planting works are undertaken in a legally compliant and sustainable manner. </p></reply>

Consequently, the Directive was transposed as it stands, without changing the Directive provisions. Ireland was one of only seven Member States to transpose the Directive ahead of the deadline.  At that time, I also established the UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department on an interim basis pending the finalisation of the primary legislation for the new Office.</p><p>In October 2021, the EU Commission published a report on the state of play regarding the transposition and implementation of the UTP Directive, taking into account notifications from Member States received by them by 31st July 2021. The Directive had not been transposed in all Member States at that time.</p><p>However, I can advise the Deputy that the report states, inter alia, that:</p><p>- Most Member States refer, to some extent, to business size as a criterion for limiting the</p><p>scope of application of the adopted legislation or parts of it. Among these, five, including Ireland, adopted the approach set out by the Directive, targeting relationships between suppliers whose annual turnover is lower than a given threshold, and buyers whose annual</p><p>turnover is higher than the same threshold. Nine MS have enlarged the scope of</p><p>application to varying degrees. </p><p>- The Directive requires Member States to prohibit a specific set of unfair practices, splitting them into two groups: (i) unconditional prohibitions (&lsquo;black list&rsquo;) and (ii) conditional prohibitions (&lsquo;grey list&rsquo;), the latter list of practices are prohibited unless agreed in clear and</p><p>unambiguous terms upfront in the supply agreement or in a subsequent agreement between the</p><p>supplier and the buyer. All Member States referred to in the report have used lists of prohibited practices and most of them, including Ireland, have followed the distinction between &lsquo;black&rsquo; and &lsquo;grey&rsquo; practices. However, while distinguishing between &lsquo;black&rsquo; and &lsquo;grey lists&rsquo;, a few MS have moved one or more &lsquo;grey list&rsquo; practices into the &lsquo;black list&rsquo;. Relatively more common is adding practices to the &lsquo;black&rsquo; and &lsquo;grey&rsquo; lists. </p><p>- The majority of Member states referred to in the report, including Ireland, include the 30-day period as a minimum standard for cancellation. </p><p>- For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the report can be found at the following link: </p><p><i>eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0652&amp;amp;from=EN</i>.</p><p>Introducing powers to extend the provisions of the Directive is a matter that is being given consideration in the preparation of the primary legislation for the establishment of the new Office of National Food Ombudsman, or equivalent, taking into account submissions made during the public consultation process and stakeholder views and EU law. </p><p>The new Office, once established, will also monitor the effects of implementation of the UTP rules.  </p></reply>

I expect to bring a Memo to Government with the General Scheme of the Bill shortly. </p>  <p>  In April 2021, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 transposing the UTP Directive directly into Irish law before the 1st May deadline for transposition. At that time, I also established the UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department on an interim basis pending the finalisation of the primary legislation for the new Office. </p>  <p>  The Enforcement Authority has been assigned all the necessary legal powers to investigate complaints from suppliers of agricultural and food products, to carry out investigations on its own initiative, and to initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the unfair trading practices defined in the Directive. It is open to those suppliers, including primary producers, to engage with the Enforcement Authority on any concerns they may have in relation to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  The new Office will, in addition to taking over this enforcement function, also carry out a price reporting and market analysis function for the agri-food supply chain in Ireland, a function I believe will bring greater transparency to the sector.  </p>  <p>  The new Office will ensure the increased availability of market information with a view to strengthening the position of primary producers and other suppliers in the agricultural and food supply chain.</p></reply>

The report, which was published in late 2020 reviewed the outcome of a Gender Balance Committee Survey on Gender Balance and Flexible working arrangements in my Department.  The report contained a number of recommendations around equality and gender balance and the monitoring and implementation of these recommendations is currently underway in my Department.</p>  <p>  My Department monitors its gender pay gap and has seen a narrowing of this pay gap from 20.5% in 2013 to 13.2% in 2020.  We expect to report a further improvement in our figures for 2021.</p>  <p>  Plans are in place to establish an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Advocacy Team within my Department, with a focus on core equality, diversity and inclusion activities.  This group will work closely with the existing gender balance steering group, to continue to drive gender balance initiatives within my Department.  </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies regularly encourage their staff to participate in Women in Agriculture and Women in STEM events.  In addition, I am committed to achieving the Government target of 40% gender balance on the Boards of our 12 State Bodies.</p>  <p>  The recently published agri-food strategy, Food Vision 2030, recognises the importance of gender balance to the long-term sustainable future for primary producers and includes actions to promote and improve gender balance at all levels, including at senior management and board level, as well as capturing and publishing gender data on policy implementation e.g. participation by women in schemes and measures. It also includes a commitment to hold a National Dialogue on Women in Agriculture.</p>  <p>  I am proud to have put forward the following package of measures on gender equality in the CAP Strategic Plan were proposed by Ireland:</p>  <p>  - Increased rate of grant aid to 60% for women aged 41-66 years under TAMS Investments</p>  <p>  - Knowledge Transfer Programme - Women only KT Groups</p>  <p>  - European Innovation Partnerships &ndash; potential for a call for proposals to incentivise women&rsquo;s participation in agriculture.</p>  <p>  - Improved recording, collection and reporting on Gender data across all CAP schemes.</p>  <p>  All CAP interventions will be developed with a gender aware perspective to ensure there are no inherent barriers to women&rsquo;s participation.  The National CAP Network established in the CAP Strategic Plan will be leveraged to increase the involvement of all women in the implementation of CAP. This will include events and support for women and a women&rsquo;s sub-committee to lead such activities.</p>  <p>  The ACORNS programme is funded under the Rural Innovation and Development Fund through my Department.  Its objective is to encourage a stronger level of enterprise development in rural areas by seeking out and assisting start-up female entrepreneurs living in rural areas to grow and develop their businesses. </p>  <p>  My Department is a core member of the Agri-food Diversity and Inclusion Forum (AgDif), led by Bord Bia and Aon, in partnership with the 30% Club.  Since 2017, the Agri-Food Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion Forum  has been a collaborative initiative with the Irish Agri-food industry, aiming to position our food and drink sector as the industry of choice for the best talent.</p></reply>

The objectives of the programme are addressed through a combination of risk assessment, voluntary assurance and national surveillance. The IJCP enables participating herd owners to have increasing confidence in the absence of infection in their herds and to achieve significant control or elimination, and it underpins the quality of Irish dairy and beef produce in the international marketplace. The programme provides a long-term approach to the control of JD in Ireland.</p>  <p>Johne&rsquo;s disease is a bacterial disease of cattle, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculossis (MAP) for which there is no effective treatment. Cattle usually become infected as calves in early life, but this is not detectable until cattle are older.  </p></reply>

Under this policy, EU fishing fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds subject to allocated fish quotas. Fishing vessels, irrespective of size, must comply with the rules of the CFP, including rules on access and catch limits/quota.</p>  <p>  The terms "supertrawler" and "factory ship" are sometimes used to describe large fishing vessels targeting pelagic stocks such as mackerel, horse mackerel and herring.  In particular, "factory ship or trawler" usually refers to vessels which process and freeze fish on board the vessel.  As the Deputy will be aware, while the Irish fleet does not have "factory vessels", it does include very large fishing vessels targeting pelagic stocks which have the capacity to catch large quantities on a trip  for processing in factories on land and which could be termed "supertrawlers". </p>  <p>  In relation to access to Irish coastal waters, I would point out that all foreign fishing vessels, on the north-west coast, are excluded from Ireland's 12 mile fishing zone, other than for transit purposes.  All foreign pelagic fishing vessels are also precluded from fishing in Ireland's 12 mile fishing zone on the west coast.  Irish fishing vessels greater than or equal to 36.58m (120 feet) in length are also precluded from fishing in Ireland's 12 mile zone.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's control authorities, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service, are responsible for the monitoring and control of fishing vessels, including large fishing vessels targeting pelagic stocks, in our Exclusive Fisheries Zone to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP. Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea-fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the SFPA and the Naval Service and I am expressly precluded from getting involved in operational matters.</p>  <p>  Last year, the European Commission published a proposal to rollover, for another ten years, the provisions relating to the restrictions on access to Member States' 6-12 nautical miles zones, as set out in the CFP Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 1380/2013).  I secured Government approval last week to seek an extension of the zones around Ireland to 12 and 20 miles respectively.  I believe that there is a strong case to be made to increase the protections for Ireland&rsquo;s fishing fleets in these waters, particularly against the background of Brexit. I will now engage with Commissioner Sinkevicius, fellow Fishery Ministers and MEPs to seek to advance Ireland&rsquo;s case on this matter. </p></reply>

The granting of the aid was subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132. </p>  <p>  Just over 33,000 participants, including the person named,  joined the scheme and, in doing so, gave a commitment to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on the holding by 5% for the period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021 as compared with the reference period of 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019 as recorded on the Department's AIM system.  </p>  <p>  In light of the difficulties some farmers were experiencing in meeting this reduction arising from COVID-19 Government Public Health restrictions, I sough a new reference period through negotiations with the European Commission. I introduced an alternative reduction period for those who required it. In that context, from 19th March 2021, BEAM participants were able to select the alternative reduction period of 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021 over which to meet their 5% reduction. This facility remained open until 21st June 2021 and some 16,000 BEAM participants opted for the deferred reduction period. </p>  <p>  The person named did not apply to be included in the later reduction period and therefore his reduction period remained as 1st July 2020 - 30th June 2021. Following the end of that reduction period, my Department undertook a series of administrative and compliance checks to ensure that the commitments farmers had entered into under the BEAM Terms and Conditions had been met. </p>  <p>  In the case of the person named, the commitment to reduce the bovine livestock manure nitrogen by 5% was not met and, as a result, all of the BEAM payment made to him in 2019 was recouped.  </p>  <p>  The person named contacted the Department to request a review of the decision. As part of the review, the nitrates figures for the applicant were checked through my Department's Animal Identification Movement system (AIM) for the full year of the deferred reduction period (1 January 2021 - 31 December 2021) and it was determined that, even if the applicant had applied for the alternative reduction period, the 5% bovine nitrates reduction would still not have been met.</p>  <p>  A letter issued on 1st February 2022 informing the applicant of the outcome of the review and of his  right to appeal the decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office.  </p></reply>

My Department's five year rural development policy Our Rural Future recognises that strong rural economies and communities are vital in supporting and safeguarding the sustainability of vibrant towns and villages across the country. </p>  <p>  Significant investment in rural Ireland is taking place across Government and my Department will continue to support communities across rural Ireland through a range of funding schemes and supports. Budget 2022 has allocated a total of &euro;379 million to my Department. Much of this funding will support the economic and social development of rural areas under my Department&rsquo;s Rural Development, Regional Affairs and Islands Programme.</p>  <p>  Funding is available from my Department through a variety of funding programmes , including the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the CL&Aacute;R Programme, the Community Enhancement Programme, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and funding for our Public Libraries. </p>  <p>  Funding is also delivered through the Community Services Programme, LEADER Programme and the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme where supports are tailored to the specific needs of individual areas.</p>  <p>  The new Connected Hubs Call aims to support and complement the development of the National Hub Network, which is a key action of the Rural Development Policy, Our Rural Future, and the National Remote Working Strategy &ndash; Making Remote Work. The Connected Hubs Call aims to add additional capacity to the existing remote working infrastructure in Ireland by upgrading existing hubs and Broadband Connection Points (BCPs), while continuing to support COVID-19 mitigation measures. The Connected Hubs Call will provide owners, operators and managers of existing remote working facilities and Broadband Connection Points with the opportunity to identify and develop their own solutions in consultation with local authorities, local business interests (e.g. Chambers of Commerce), Town Teams (or similar bodies) and community groups as appropriate. The deadline for applications is 6pm on 4th April 2022.</p>  <p>  To conclude, I want to acknowledge An Post and the postmasters around the country who provided vital services to communities throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and should be commended for that.</p></reply>

Those supports include the following programmes and schemes:</p><p><b>CL&Aacute;R 2022 </b>opened on the 24 Feb 2022. It is a targeted investment programme which provides funding for small-scale infrastructural projects in rural areas that have suffered the greatest levels of population decline. The Measures being funded under the 2022 CL&Aacute;R Programme are; Measure 1: Developing Community Facilities &amp;amp; Amenities; Measure 2: Mobility, Cancer Care and Community First Responders Transport and Measure 3: &ldquo;Our Islands&rdquo;. Full details of the 2022 programme are available at <i>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/91ba52-clar/?section=2022-clar-measures</i>.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s<b>Community Services Programme (CSP),</b>currently supports over 420 community organisations, some of which have been awarded charitable status, to provide employment opportunities and local services through a social enterprise model.  My Department and Pobal are currently working on the restructuring of the programme, following the independent review of the CSP, undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants and are engaging with a Consultative Group representative of stakeholders on the matter.  In the interim, all existing CSP contracts are extended up to the end of December 2022.  Pending the transition to the new restructured programme, the scheme is currently closed to new applications through the expression of interest process.  It is anticipated that the Programme will open calls to address identified gaps in service delivery in 2022, however, I am unable, at this stage, to elaborate on the timing of potential calls, as the matter is currently under consideration.  Funding for additional new entrants will be considered in light of available budgets, during the year.  </p><p>My Department continues to support social enterprises in a number of different ways including through the annual <b>&euro;2.3m Dormant Accounts funded Social Enterprise Measure</b>. I plan to make further announcements on new supports later this year in line with policy commitments.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s<b>Community &amp;amp; Voluntary Supports programme </b>provides a cohesive framework of support for the community and voluntary sector. &euro;5.5m has been provided in 2022 under this programme to support 29 Volunteer Centres, a number of national organisations such as Volunteer Ireland, and to support the implementation of the National Volunteering Strategy 2021-2025. Funding under this framework is provided to strengthen and support volunteering, to facilitate and foster volunteerism in Ireland and to build a support structure to develop volunteering locally.  It enables Volunteer Centres in each county to play a central role in facilitating and supporting the development of volunteering in their areas.</p><p>Funding has also been provided to The Community Volunteer Programme. This programme is co-ordinated by Volunteer Ireland and the network of Volunteer Centres with support from the local authorities. The programme will enhance current volunteering capacity for forthcoming events and potential emergencies.</p><p><b>LEADER </b>is a multi-annual programme which is delivered through 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs) around the country. Funding for organisations referred to by the Deputy may be available through the LEADER Programme. The Transitional LEADER Programme came into effect from 1 April 2021 and will run to the end of 2022. A total of &euro;70 million is being made available over this programming period. In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. Prospective applicants should, in the first instance, contact their relevant LAG, through its Implementing Partner, to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. The list of all Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on the Gov.ie website at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c45498-local-action-groups</i>. </p><p><b>The Town and Village Scheme (T&amp;amp;V)</b>is one of a series of national and local support measures designed to rejuvenate small rural towns and villages throughout Ireland. Local Authorities were invited to submit up to 8 applications per Local Authority area under the 2021 T&amp;amp;V Scheme. The 2022 scheme is not yet announced for applications to be made. </p><p>The new <b>Connected Hubs Call</b>will support and complement the development of the National Hub Network, which is a key action of the Rural Development Policy - Our Rural Future and the National Remote Working Strategy &ndash; Making Remote Work. The Connected Hubs Call aims to add additional capacity to the existing remote working infrastructure in Ireland by upgrading existing hubs and Broadband Connection Points (BCPs), while continuing to support COVID-19 mitigation measures. The Connected Hubs Call will provide owners, operators and managers of existing remote working facilities and BCPs with the opportunity to identify and develop their own solutions in consultation with local authorities, local business interests (e.g. Chambers of Commerce), Town Teams (or similar bodies) and community groups as appropriate. Deadline for Applications &ndash; 6pm on April 4th 2022. More information on the scheme and how to apply can be found at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/service/16b47-connected-hubs-fund/</i>.</p><p>Projects approved for funding under the <b>Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF)</b>are large scale, ambitious projects that have the potential to transform rural economies and communities.Applications to the RRDF must be led by a State-funded body, however other organisations can partner in an application. The fourth call for Category 1 projects was announced in December 2021 and the closing date for applications is 29th April 2022.  Further information on the RRDF and details on how to apply are available at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/c77144-rural-regeneration-and-development-fund/</i>.</p><p><b>The &euro;9 million Community Activities Fund</b>will support groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs such as utility or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities. Groups will also be able to use the funding to carry out necessary repairs and to purchase equipment such as tables and chairs, tools and signage, laptops and printers, lawnmowers, canopies and training equipment. The once-off fund will be allocated under the Department&rsquo;s Community Enhancement Programme and is administered locally by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs). Applications were accepted until the 25 February 2022.</p><p><b>The Community Enhancement Programme (CEP)</b>provides capital funding to community groups in disadvantaged areas across Ireland. The CEP is funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development and provides grant funding for communities to enhance their local facilities. It is intended that the CEP will open again in Q2 2022. The CEP is administered by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area, on behalf of my Department.</p><p><b>The &euro;15 million 2022 Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS)</b>will see the development of natural amenities such as our mountains, lakes, beaches, bogs, walkways, greenways and blueways. The Scheme, will place a particular focus on developing adventure tourism in Rural Ireland. It will support activities such as hiking, mountaineering, kayaking, swimming and cycling, which were especially popular among families throughout the Pandemic. In this case applicants eligible are Local Authorities and Local Development Companies, who must work with local communities to identify projects. Full details of the application process are available at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/216398/f2177cba-177b-49c3-97e0-67b3cacb92f4.pdf#page=null</i>.</p><p><b>The Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO)</b>provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national community and voluntary organisations that demonstrate good governance and deliver services and supports that have a focus on one or more of the following: addressing poverty, social exclusion and promoting equality. The Scheme is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department. The current three year scheme commenced on 1 July 2019 and will cease on 30 June 2022. A total of &euro;18.8 million has been allocated under the current scheme to a total of 74 organisations. A new iteration of the scheme will commence in July 2022. The application portal for this new iteration opened on 10 February 2022, with a closing date of 24 February 2022. Funding for the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO Scheme) has increased from &euro;5.9 million to &euro;6.7 million in 2022. </p><p>Groups or organisations qualify for support schemes or programmes provided by my Department where they meet the requisite eligibility criteria. Groups should check my Departments website for scheme announcements and regarding closing dates for applications at <i>gov.ie</i>. </p><p>Ongoing dialogue is maintained by my Department with rural and urban stakeholders in order to identify and respond to issues impacting on individuals and communities. I will also continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues and will monitor the issues which impact our urban and rural communities in order to respond to emerging needs.</p></reply>
