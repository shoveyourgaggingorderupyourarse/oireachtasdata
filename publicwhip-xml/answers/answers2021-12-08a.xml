It is aimed at encouraging collaboration and innovation in the development and deployment of disruptive technologies, on a commercial basis, targeted at tackling national and global challenges. It is managed by my Department and administered by Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  DTIF focuses on the ability of Irish SMEs to drive disruptive innovation through collaboration on research between enterprise and research institutions. The Fund is open to partnerships working on projects that have the potential to significantly alter markets or the way businesses operate. </p>  <p>  In November 2020 the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) published a Spending Review of the Fund, which was a comprehensive evaluation of the Fund aimed at systematically assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of DTIF and ensuring that the Fund remains in alignment with its policy objectives. The review acknowledged a strong rationale for a publicly funded programme making significant investments in disruptive technologies which are high-risk, high-return. It found that the programme is working towards achieving its stated objectives, including maintaining a focus on collaboration and building on publicly-funded research.</p>  <p>  The five recommendations in the Spending Review were aimed at ensuring that the Fund was clear in its focus, targeted correctly and monitored appropriately. The recommendations are all either addressed or underway. I launched the fourth call of the Fund last month and it continues to focus on the potential for SMEs to drive disruptive innovation. A fifth call, which will adopt a theme-based approach, is currently under development.</p>  <p>  The Review recommended closely monitoring the progress of projects and set out a proposed framework &ndash; a Programme Logic Model (PLM) &ndash; for measuring the impact of the DTIF in the years ahead particularly as the first projects come to fruition from mid-2022. This PLM maps out the logical steps and associated key performance indicators (KPIs) in terms of the inputs, activities, outputs and final outcomes and impacts which emerge through the implementation of a programme.</p>  <p>  The Spending Review also made a recommendation for a review examining the processes of the Fund. This review, which is currently underway and is now due for completion in February 2022, will provide feedback on participants&rsquo; experiences of DTIF to date and will set out in more detail the processes required to embed and operationalise the aforementioned PLM to ensure that it aligns with existing reporting mechanisms and avoids unnecessary duplication. On completion of the review, we expect that any additional recommendations arising from the review, with regard to measuring the impact of the programme, will be in place before the first projects are completed in mid-2022.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the operation of the Fund to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives and the needs of its stakeholders.</p></reply>

The Fund is open to partnerships working on projects that have the potential to significantly alter markets or the way businesses operate.  It encourages private co-investment by lowering the risk profile associated with investment in high-risk, high-reward innovations. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland administers the selection process with oversight by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. DTIF is a competitive offer and eligible applications are evaluated by independent international technical and commercialisation experts using call-specific selection criteria.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland maintains an Expert Database from which it selects appropriate evaluation experts to evaluate applications on the basis of the call-specific selection criteria, professional expertise and experience. As a public research funding body, the agency regularly sources new evaluation experts, including from the European Commission's database of experts, for its research programmes. Factors which are considered in the selection of evaluation experts include geographical and sector balance, gender balance, regular rotation, and conflict of interest. All evaluation experts used in DTIF calls to date are resident outside the state.</p><p>Each eligible DTIF application is assigned to an evaluation panel of three evaluators for remote evaluation. At interview stage, a senior official from Enterprise Ireland chairs the interview between the same evaluation panel and the project partners. </p><p>The total number of experts used in each of the calls for the Fund is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Call </th>       <th>No. of Evaluation Experts Used </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Call 1 </td>       <td>20 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Call 2 </td>       <td>24 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Call 3 </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The European Commission's database of experts is updated regularly and Information on the total number of experts on the database for each call is not available.</p></reply>

The proposal is targeted and pragmatic and aims at ensuring that governments can resort to compulsory licences, including to export to countries with no or limited manufacturing capacities, in the most effective manner adapted to the circumstances of a pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The EU is of the view that there is no single solution and that a multi-pronged approach is needed and that discussions should concentrate on how the Intellectual Property system can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  Despite the postponement of the WTO Ministerial Conference, WTO members will continue to engage in a solution-oriented manner to find an outcome on how the WTO can contribute to an effective response to any pandemic, not just the current one.</p>  <p>  Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions including discussions on how the flexibilities within the TRIPS Agreement can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  The global production of vaccines is increasing rapidly and it is estimated that 12 billion doses of COVID vaccines will be produced by the end of 2021. The EU considers that the COVAX Facility is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply. </p>  <p>  Europe has committed 200 million doses to reach low and middle-income countries by the end of this year, mainly through the COVAX initiative and is investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa.</p>  <p>  Ireland has contributed &euro;7 million in funding to COVAX in 2021 and will donate 1.3 million vaccines this year to low-income countries as part of the COVAX programme.  The first 500,000 Irish doses donated through the facility reached Nigeria on the 29th of November with further donations of Irish vaccines taking place in the coming weeks.  In addition, Ireland has delivered on its commitment to donate 335,000 COVID-19 doses to Uganda.</p></reply>

Its Secretariat is based in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p><p>As part of its 2021 work programme, the EGFSN undertook a study on the nature and quantity of skills required between now and 2030 to deliver on some of the key enabling measures in the Climate Action Plan. </p><p>These are the targeting of 5GW of offshore renewable wind energy, an increase in onshore wind energy of up to 8.2GW, and the generation of up to 1.5GW of grid scale solar energy; the energy efficient retrofit of 500,000 residential homes to a minimum B2 Building Energy Rating; and the target of having 840,000 electric cars, as well as 95,000 commercial vehicles, on Irish roads. </p><p>The resulting study, <i>Skills for Zero Carbon: The Demand for Renewable Energy, Residential Retrofit and Electric Vehicle Deployment Skills to 2030, </i>was published by the EGFSN on 24th November, and the Government has committed to acting on its findings in both <i>Housing for All- A New Housing Plan for Ireland </i>and <i>Climate Action Plan 2021- Securing our Future, </i>through a range of upskilling, reskilling and apprenticeship supports.</p><p>According to the EGFSN's analysis, in order to deliver on the <i>Climate Action Plan's</i>2030 targets, employment in wind and solar energy generation will have to quickly increase to 8,000, from a 3,000 baseline in 2020, within a number of years, and ultimately stand at 9,000 by 2030. This will mainly consist of workers in roles including Construction and Installation, Technicians and Technical Professionals, Engineering, Transport and Logistics, and Legal and Professional Services.</p><p>The workforce engaged in residential retrofit and heat pump installation will similarly have to ramp up quickly and increase more than fourfold (from c.4,000), to stand at over 17,000 for the remainder of the decade. These roles will mainly be concentrated in Insulation and Airtightness, Cosmetic and Repair, Lighting and Electrics, Engineering and Support, and Heating.</p><p>The existing motor mechanic workforce of c.15,000 will meanwhile need to be transitioned to work on Electric Vehicles as EV uptake increases.</p><p>The full details of these forecasts, including the occupational breakdowns, can be read in chapter 6 of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs report, which is available on <i>www.egfsn.ie. </i></p></reply>

The CRU is assisted in its statutory role by EirGrid. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan 2021-2030 and the Climate Action Plan 2021 set out the need to develop circa 2,000 MW of new gas-fired generation in order to ensure security of supply and underpin Ireland&rsquo;s increased target of up to 80% of electricity demand to come from renewable sources by 2030. </p>  <p>  The Government approved and published a new Policy Statement on Electricity Security of Supply on 30 November which sets out that the development of new conventional generation, including gas-fired and gas oil/distillate-fired generation, is a national priority and should be permitted and supported in order to ensure security of electricity supply and support the growth of renewable electricity generation. </p>  <p>  It is for the CRU to ensure suitable market structures and mechanisms are in place to incentivise and support the development of this generation. This work forms part of the overall CRU work programme to ensure security of electricity supply.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-08a.60.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120800092#WRC00400"><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, as amended.  As an economy-wide support, the EWSS has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees since July 2020. The EWSS provides a subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  To date (2 December 2021), payments of over &euro;5.68 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;893 million have been granted to 51,700 employers in respect of some 694,600 workers.</p>  <p>  The Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020 places the administration of the EWSS under the care and management of Revenue, which includes ensuring that this very significant investment of public funds is properly allocated to eligible employers. In the exercise of this important role, Revenue is, and will be, undertaking assurance checks in relation to the scheme to ensure its conditions have been met.</p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for EWSS are based on self-assessment principles and the legislation provides that an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Revenue, having regard to risk indicators, may examine closely the evidence/basis for entering the scheme of certain EWSS applications.  </p>  <p>  If a reduction in customer orders is being considered as the basis for eligibility for the scheme, the following are examples of how it will apply &ndash;</p>  <p>  - In the case of a retail business, a pub, a fast-food outlet and similar type businesses, at least a 30% reduction in the value of overall sales (cash, credit and orders, including on-line and telephone orders).</p>  <p>  - In the case of a businesses which operates largely by way of &ldquo;bookings&rdquo; such as a restaurant, hotel, B&amp;B, hostel, camp site, caravan park: at least a 30% reduction in the value of bookings for the relevant period.</p>  <p>  - In the case of public and private transport service providers: at least a 30% reduction in the volume of online bookings for passenger journeys or a 30% reduction in the number of passenger journeys or a 30% reduction in the value of passenger ticket sales.</p>  <p>  Further details on the EWSS eligibility criteria are contained in guidelines published on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/documents/ewss/guidelines-on-eligibility-for-ewss.pdf.</p>  <p>  It has been a key requirement of the EWSS since its introduction that employers undertake a review of their trading situation on the last day of every month to ensure they continue to meet the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility criteria. This became more important as more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; trading activities resumed across many sectors of the economy from mid-2021. In that context, the EWSS Eligibility Review Form (ERF) was developed to assist employers in conducting the required monthly review of their continuing eligibility for the scheme, thereby eliminating potential overpayments. This has acted as an effective deterrent since the introduction of the control from 1 July 2021.    </p>  <p>  To address the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question regarding the safeguards that are in place to ensure that a business experienced a reduction in turnover of 30% and that this reduction was solely caused by Covid-19, in most instances, it will be very clear from the nature of the EWSS applicant&rsquo;s trade how such a reduction in turnover has come about. However, in parallel with self-assessment principles, Revenue has also been conducting a range of compliance checks to ensure that employers satisfy all the conditions for the EWSS.    </p>  <p>  Underpinning these compliance checks is the use of data analytics to interrogate data on Revenue&rsquo;s systems, identifying employers who may not meet the eligibility criteria, and undertaking an intervention in accordance with the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and Other Compliance Interventions. Pre-emptive analysis using ERF data and other sources of returned data is actively being used and showing to be effective in improving Revenue&rsquo;s ability to identify and better target EWSS fraud risk    In most instances, agreement is reached and EWSS overpaid is recouped or the liability is &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo;.  Where issues are identified and agreement is not reached, Revenue will raise an EWSS notice of assessment and employers have the option to submit an appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) within 30 days of the assessment. There are currently 56 assessments raised in the amount of about &euro; 4.8m of which 4 have been appealed in the amount of almost &euro;1.1m.   </p>  <p>  I am advised that 3,363 interventions have been finalised on 3,087 employers yielding in excess of &euro;13.6m which equates to 0.2% of EWSS claimed to date.  A further 2,020 checks are ongoing on an additional 2,005 employers meaning almost 10% of employers who have claimed to date have had an intervention reviewing their compliance with the scheme. </p>  <p>  The EWSS legislation also provides for anti-abuse measures which also feature as part of Revenue&rsquo;s overall compliance programme.  These anti-abuse measures provide that where a Revenue officer determines that it is reasonable to conclude that an employer, at any time over the term of the EWSS, has attempted to manipulate normal payroll runs and normal payment of wages with a view to securing that a wage subsidy amount, or an increased wage subsidy amount, is paid in relation to an employee, the employer concerned will be deemed never to have been an eligible employer for the EWSS and will be required to repay wage subsidies and PRSI credit received, and may also face the imposition of interest, penalties and potential prosecution.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue is rigorous in its structured programme of checks to ensure the eligibility of businesses for subsidy payments under EWSS and will pursue any instances where a business fails to qualify for the scheme for whatever reason. However, if the Deputy has a particular employer or instance in mind where she believes a business may have received EWSS payments to which they were not entitled to, she should contact Revenue directly in relation to the matter. </p></reply>

Indeed, in 2020 the actual price level, as indicated by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), was almost 20 per cent below the price level had inflation grown at 2 per cent over the 2008-2020 period.</p><p>Low inflation over the last decade can in part be explained by the impacts of the global financial crisis. The recovery from the crisis was slow, with considerable labour market slack likely weighing on demand and in turn inflation over the past decade. Additionally, a number of structural factors have been identified as potential drivers of the disinflationary trends seen across advanced economies more generally in recent decades. These include globalisation, in particular China&rsquo;s membership of the World Trade Organisation, the integration of global supply chains and demographic change. </p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the low inflation trends seen in recent years. While the pandemic was both a demand- and supply-side shock, in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak, the decline in demand outstripped the fall in supply such that the net impact on prices was deflationary.  While inflation remained subdued in Ireland in the first quarter of 2021, inflation has since picked up, with the annual rate of inflation reaching 5.4 per cent in November &ndash; the highest rate in over two decades. Similar trends have been recorded across advanced economies, with inflation in the euro area hitting an all-time high of 4.9 per cent in November. </p><p>The recent rise in inflation however is partly explained by global factors, many of which are expected to prove temporary in nature. These include &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with normalisation of oil prices, recent commodity price developments, disruptions to global supply chains triggered by the pandemic as well as more general imbalances between supply and demand that have emerged across advanced economies following re-opening. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to moderate over the course of next year as temporary factors fade, demand stabilises and supply pressures ease. However, the recent emergence of the Omicron variant means there is now increased uncertainty about the inflation outlook.</p><p>Table 1 below shows the annual percentage change in both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) over the period 2008-2020. The full year data for 2021 will only be available when the December figures are published. Both the CPI and HICP indices measure the average price level of a fixed basket of goods and services. The primary difference between the two measures is the basket of goods and services covered, for instance mortgage interest is not included in the HICP. Additionally, the HICP, as a harmonised measure, is very useful for cross-country comparison. In general, however, the two measures move closely together.</p><p><b>Table 1: Annual rate of inflation</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Annual % change </th>       <th>Consumer Price Index (CPI) </th>       <th>Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2008 </td>       <td>4.1 </td>       <td>3.1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2009 </td>       <td>-4.5 </td>       <td>-1.7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010 </td>       <td>-1 </td>       <td>-1.6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>2.6 </td>       <td>1.2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>1.7 </td>       <td>1.9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>0.5 </td>       <td>0.5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>0.2 </td>       <td>0.3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>-0.3 </td>       <td>0.0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>0.0 </td>       <td>-0.2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>0.4 </td>       <td>0.3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>0.5 </td>       <td>0.7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>0.9 </td>       <td>0.9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>-0.3 </td>       <td>-0.5  </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-08a.69.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120800092#WRC01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 to 50, inclusive, and 52 together.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.</p>  <p>  In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (2nd December) by EWSS is over &euro;6.5 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.684 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;893 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 694,600 employees.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that almost &euro;1.5 billion in EWSS subsidy payments has been paid to the hospitality sector since the introduction of the scheme. Broadly, that is the largest share of payments to any sector and accounts for approximately 26% of all payments made to date.</p>  <p>  The consistent approach of Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support under this scheme. At the same time, we have been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial cost to the Exchequer.  It is also worth noting that, within the scheme, more than half of those that benefit from EWSS are in sectors outside of the hospitality sector and would not be impacted by the latest public health measures.</p>  <p>  Last Friday, the Government decided that a targeted support in response to the further public health restrictions imposed on the hospitality sector would be introduced.  The Deputies will be aware of the associated announcements that have been made.   This targeted scheme will be modelled on the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) which operated effectively in the earlier phases of the pandemic when businesses were most heavily impacted by public health restrictions. The scheme will provide targeted and timely support to the hospitality sector to supplement the support they are receiving under the EWSS.   Work is continuing at present to finalise all the various elements of this more focussed support measure which it is proposed will be paid weekly in arrears.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances, the EWSS as an economy wide scheme will continue on the path laid out for it on Budget day with the necessary legislation for this currently being debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Deputies may also wish to note that businesses affected by the recent public health restrictions may continue to benefit from EWSS alongside the more targeted scheme mentioned above.</p>  <p>  Finally, as has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely and to respond appropriately as circumstances require.</p></reply>

The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.

The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1st March 2021. By the closing date, over 3,100 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding. This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were published earlier this year and all applications are being assessed accordingly. Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on the 6th August. The associated letter of provisional allocation encouraged all grantees to draw down this funding before year-end if possible and in recent weeks my Department has been prioritising the payments of all existing grants. Ensuring that as many older grants as possible are paid before year-end will maximise the funding available to allocate to the 2020 capital SCEP applications.</p>  <p>  In relation to these 2020 capital SCEP applications, which include one submitted by the organisation referred to by the Deputy, assessment work is continuing and every effort is being made to complete it as quickly as possible. Given the record number of applications received however, it is likely to take a further number of weeks to have these assessments fully complete with final recommended allocations expected early in the New Year. </p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. Fire services issues are managed in my Department by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM).</p><p>Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide, with 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters.</p><p>In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms/standards being established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.  In respect of crewing levels, KCS establishes a national norm of  5 personnel on the first pump mobilised from a station to include a designated Incident Commander, with 4 personnel on the second or subsequent pumps mobilised from the same station. The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, ' Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the varied staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.</p><p>While my Department does not routinely collect the data in the format requested by the Deputy, a breakdown of the number of firefighters in each fire service as of October 2021, based on data supplied by local authorities, is set out in the table below. Information in relation to staffing in individual fire stations is not available at this time.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Fire Service</th>       <th>Total no. of operational staff in stations</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>93 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>76 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City </td>       <td>152 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County </td>       <td>204 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>154 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td>963 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>154 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>104 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>63 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>65</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>66</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>42</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>140 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>44 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>100 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>119 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>72 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>51 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>52 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>47 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>127 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>124 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>46 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>63 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>94 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>3305</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities: Dublin City, South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Councils. The management of resources, equipment and the number and type of fire appliances is a matter for the City Council based on their assessment of local needs and requirements. Continued investment in the national fleet is one of the key priorities for my Department's Fire Services Capital Programme. </p>  <p>  Dublin City Council was allocated four new &ldquo;Class B&rdquo; fire appliances in the latest Appliance Procurement Programme at an approximate cost of &euro;1.9m. Dublin City Council was also grant-aided to procure three new &ldquo;Class B&rdquo; fire appliances in both the 2015 and 2017 Programmes. </p>  <p>  My Department works with fire services in Dublin in relation to their priority projects. In July 2019, Dublin City Council was approved to purchase a new turntable ladder/ aerial appliance at a cost of &euro;800,000 plus VAT, delivery of which is due later this year. In September 2021, the Council requested approval for the purchase of a new turntable ladder at a cost of &euro;850,000. This application has recently been approved. Fire appliances are acquired through a competitive tendering process.</p>  <p>  The management, disposition and deployment of its appliance fleet is a matter for the officers of Dublin Fire Brigade. I understand that Dublin Fire Brigade's fleet of aerial appliances consists of two turntable ladders based at Dublin Fire Brigade Headquarters in Tara Street, and a hydraulic platform based at D&uacute;n Laoghaire Fire Station, all of which can be deployed rapidly to anywhere in the functional area of the four local authorities. </p>  <p>  The appropriate fire safety measures, including facilities to assist fire service response, in any building are based on the scale, density and height of the building and are set out in national Building Regulations and associated Technical Guidance and Codes of Practice. The Fire Safety Task Force established in the aftermath of the Grenfell tragedy, in its report of May 2018, states &ldquo;The key to life safety in all apartment buildings is a proper two-stage fire detection and alarm system, together with an evacuation strategy&hellip;&rdquo;. The primary statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of persons using any building rests with the persons having control of those buildings. The design and construction of buildings in the first instance, including inbuilt fire safety features such as building layout, means of escape and fire resistance are critical for protecting persons from fire. Safety features, such as fire detection and alarm systems, support safe evacuation of occupants and the containment of fires. </p>  <p>  In relation to fighting fires in high-rise buildings, my Department has issued guidance entitled &ldquo;Fighting Fires in High-Rise Buildings&rdquo;. This was part of a suite of 47 Standard Operational Guidance (SOG) documents developed between 2010 and 2012 by fire service personnel and issued by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management.</p></reply>

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant. The borrower surrenders their property to their lender who sells it to a MTR provider which can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd.  The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.</p><p>To the end of September 2021, 1497 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013. The 1497 households in the scheme represent 2460 adults and 2091 children who have remained living in their homes and communities. As of that date, 850 active cases were being progressed under the scheme. The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme including a local authority or purchaser status report which shows a breakdown of the number of active, completed, ineligible and terminated cases per local authority or purchaser. This information is available on the Housing Agency's website at the following link: www.housingagency.ie/housing-information/mortgage-rent-statistics  </p><p>A MTR scheme was also introduced for local authority borrowers initially as a pilot in 2013, and has been in place nationally since 2014. Under the scheme, a local authority can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as social housing tenants. From its inception in 2013 to end 2020, the Local Authority Mortgage To Rent scheme has benefited a total of 532 households. Details and statistical information in relation to the Local Authority MTR scheme and broken down by local authority area is available on my Department's website under the heading Local Authority Mortgage to Rent at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/42d2f-local-authority-loan-activity/#local-authority-mortgage-to-rent-scheme</p><p>Both MTR schemes are established parts of the overall suite of social housing options and are important parts of the mortgage arrears resolution process.</p><p>A review of the MTR scheme took place in 2017 and explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme. This review was published in February 2017 and a copy is attached. Along with introducing a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the MTR scheme, the review concluded that the financial model of the scheme at the time may not have been capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme. The review, taking account of capacity within the AHB sector given that sector's role in delivering ambitious targets around new social housing supply, recommended that alternative funding options, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment, be explored in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale. An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request was initiated by the Housing Agency in October 2017 inviting parties from the private sector to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model.  The outcome from the EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.</p><p>Under this alternatively funded model, Home for Life Ltd. purchases properties from lenders subsequent to their voluntary surrender by borrowers that meet the MTR eligibility criteria and then enters into a long-term 25 year lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for a defined term at an agreed rent, thereby enabling the borrower to remain living in their own home under a tenancy agreement with the local authority.  Home for Life Ltd. is also responsible for managing and maintaining the property on behalf of the local authority in accordance with the lease requirements.  </p><p>The inclusion of an MTR provider from the private sector has facilitated more individuals and families staying in their homes. Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme. In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focused on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears. </p><p>The Programme for Government and Housing for All includes a commitment to strengthen the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and ensure that it is helping those who need it<i>. </i>Building on the significant improvements already made to the scheme since 2017, my Department is currently working closely with the Housing Agency and key stakeholders to identify any further improvements required to the scheme.  As set out in Housing For All, the review of the MTR scheme is scheduled to be delivered in Q4 of this year and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.</p><p>&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2021-12-08_pq59-60-08-12-2021_en.pdf  &quot;&amp;gt;Mortgage to Rent Scheme&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</p></reply>

The legislative provisions for the Electoral Commission are being progressed as part of an Electoral Reform Bill, which also provides for the modernisation of the electoral registration process, the regulation of online political advertising during election periods and provisions which are aimed at assisting with the holding of electoral events where Covid-19 restrictions are in place. </p><p>Following Government approval of the drafting of an Electoral Reform Bill, the Bill's General Scheme was circulated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in January  for pre-legislative consideration. The General Scheme is available on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/34cf6-general-scheme-of-the-electoral-reform-bill-2020.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee carried out a thorough pre-legislative scrutiny process, taking in the views of a wide range of stakeholders and policy experts over seven sessions between January and August of this year. The committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report was published in August and is available from the Oireachtas website at www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/33/housing-local-government-and-heritage/. The recommendations in the report are currently being considered by my Department. My Department is continuing to work with the Attorney General's Office on the drafting of the Electoral Reform Bill and good progress is being made. The Bill is included on the list of priority legislation in the Government's current legislation programme and I expect that it will be published and will commence its progress through the Oireachtas in the new year.</p><p>In addition to the legislative work that is being advanced, progress is also being made in respect of the practicalities of the Commission's establishment.  In this regard, a team was put in place earlier in the year and is working on the preparatory institutional and administrative arrangements for the Electoral Commission, pending its formal establishment. </p></reply>

The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Verification of consent of all guardians is vital to protecting the integrity of the passport itself and the rights of the child and its guardians.</p>  <p>  Passport applications are valid for six months for a number of reasons including International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) regulations on the requirement for a recent photograph. The ICAO is a UN specialised agency which defines in detail the required format for a passport. This timeframe also ensures that a refund of the fees can be processed electronically where required. If the refund is not made electronically within six months then it can take up to 12 months to process a refund by bank transfer.</p>  <p>  With regard the specific application about which the Deputy is enquiring, the Passport Service was in contact with the applicant's guardian to request the correct supporting documents required to approve and issue the passport. Unfortunately, these documents were not submitted by the time the passport application had come close to expiration and the application was cancelled. The passport fee has been refunded in this case. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service has been in direct contact with the applicant's guardian and has explained what is required to re-apply for their child's passport with the correct documentation and consent form.</p></reply>

The Communiqu&eacute; which was made public after the meeting is attached for your reference. </p>  <p>  Minister McEntee and I represented the Irish Government while the British Government was represented by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis MP, and Conor Burns MP, the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office.</p>  <p>  The Conference was established under Strand Three of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement &ldquo;to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of the UK and Irish Governments&rdquo;. The Conference is also an important forum for discussions on the broader British-Irish relationship: both Governments agree on the deep value of strong bilateral cooperation at all levels.</p>  <p>  The most recent meeting of the Conference had a wide ranging agenda which covered; East-West matters; Economic Cooperation; Rights and Citizenship; Security Cooperation; Legacy; Political Stability; Covid; and for the first time, we also discussed energy cooperation and the outcomes of the recent COP26 Conference in Glasgow. </p>  <p>  At the Conference I took the opportunity to note, and express appreciation for, the strong levels of cooperation and partnership between our respective Consular teams in Dublin, London and across the world during 2021.</p>  <p>  Looking at our significant and important economic relationship, we each agreed to work to explore synergies between the UK and Ireland&rsquo;s respective Levelling Up initiative and the National Development Plan to ensure maximum benefit for the peoples of these islands.</p>  <p>  In our first discussion about the environment, in this particular forum, we noted the positive outcome at COP26 in Glasgow, and recognised the ongoing importance of cooperation between the United Kingdom and Ireland to act on the agreement in Glasgow, and accelerate climate action in this critical decade.</p>  <p>  The Forum provided an opportunity to discuss the current security situation and the threats posed by terrorism, paramilitarism and the associated criminality. We paid tribute to the ongoing high levels of cooperation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Security Services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which are central to effectively combatting these threats.</p>  <p>  The Conference provided a timely opportunity to engage with Secretary of State Lewis on the British Government&rsquo;s legacy proposals set out in its command paper. We reviewed the discussions to date as part of the multiparty legacy engagement process agreed at the meeting of the Conference in June and had an exchange of views on next steps. This was an important engagement where we were able to speak in depth about the issues. I also took the opportunity to raise issues of concern in respect to a number of individual legacy cases.</p>  <p>  The political strain of Brexit, the Protocol and COVID has weighed on the NI Executive and Assembly for some time. It is incumbent on the two Governments to work in support of all of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement institutions given their interdependent and interlocking nature. As a Conference and as the two Governments, we reinforced our commitment to continuing close co-operation.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the next meeting of the Conference in early 2022 and to building on the work undertaken since regular meetings of the Conference resumed in 2018.</p></reply>

In the 2020/21 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.  </p>  <p>  For the 2020/21 school year, based on public health advice the Department provided for School Transport Scheme services to fully operate, but with additional measures in place including the operation of post-primary transport services at 50% capacity. Primary services operated at 100% capacity but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place. </p>  <p>  For the 2021/22 school year, planning for school transport scheme services proceeded on the basis that the public health measures in place as schools closed at the end of the last school year would remain as the term began in this new school year. This included the operation of post-primary services at 50% capacity.  The Department has kept this position under review as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services was rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeded. </p>  <p>  In line with the lifting of restrictions on public transport, and with effect from the return of schools following the October mid-term break, implementation commenced for post-primary school transport services to resume operating at 100% capacity.  All other measures relating to hygiene, pre-assigned seating, cleaning and the wearing of masks by post-primary students will remain in place subject to further review.  With regard to primary transport, measures relating to hygiene, pre-assigned seating and cleaning continue to be in place also. </p>  <p>  With regard to post-primary special needs transport services, the Department is working with schools on a case by case basis where such services may be required to continue operating at 50% capacity. </p></reply>

NPHET has recommended and the Government has approved a measure introducing the wearing of face masks by children in a number of settings including in 3rd class and above in primary schools. The measure is being introduced on a temporary basis and is subject to review in mid-February 2022.</p>  <p>  Given that masks are now in use in a range of settings, students are encouraged to bring their own face coverings. If a student forgets or misplaces their mask, schools are asked to provide them with a spare mask. Schools have also been provided with significant additional resources of &euro;639m in the last academic year to keep schools safe in line with the covid-19 response plans.  </p>  <p>  Further funding of &euro;57.6 million has been paid by way of Covid-19 capitation to schools in September for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for this term. This funding will cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, PPE requirements including masks, and enhanced cleaning supports and supervision.

Where issues arise, schools will engage pragmatically and sensitively with parents to explore any particular difficulties arising for an individual child.  The FAQ can be found at the following link here </p>  <p>  The guidance recognises that in the case of certain children with additional needs, schools may be already aware of difficulties they may face in the appropriate use of face coverings. Schools will be best placed to identify those children whose complex needs are such that the wearing of face covering may not be possible for them, and to discuss this with parents as required. In such circumstances, schools do not require medical certification to provide an exemption to the wearing of face coverings. </p>  <p>  In the case of children who have a hearing impairment and or reply on lip reading, the guidance provides for schools to use visors or consider other solutions that do not present an impediment to communication.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p><p>A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use.  This should enable the appropriate balance to be achieved between good ventilation and managing comfort levels in the classroom.</p><p>The Department's guidance outlines CO<sub>2</sub>monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p><p>In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million which assists in guiding their ventilation strategy. </p><p>My Department's approach on good ventilation in schools, as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus, is fully consistent with Public Health advice and  the Expert Group recommendations on good practices, the use of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors and the targeted deployment of HEPA air filter devices where necessary for poorly ventilated areas. </p></reply>

Enhanced allocations have been provided for special schools and schools which are in the disadvantaged (DEIS) scheme. The hours were available to schools from October of this year and can be used throughout the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Full detail of the programme is set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 045/2021 which is available at www.gov.ie/en/circular/aec0a-covid-learning-and-support-scheme/  </p><p>Pupils in Cork who require additional teaching time in schools are eligible to receive support under the CLASS programme.</p><p>Pupils who attend DEIS schools are also eligible to receive support under the CLASS scheme. </p><p>Circular 0045/2021 notes that the allocation of CLASS hours is a whole school provision and that schools may target the support to whichever pupils most need it.</p><p>Guidance has been provided to help schools on how to identify pupil who need additional supports.  The guidance also advises schools in relation to how the additional teaching hours should be best used and as to how schools should identify and prioritise pupils for support.</p><p>This guidance is available at: </p><p>Covid-19 Learning and Support Scheme (CLASS) Guidance for Primary and Special Schools: www.gov.ie/en/publication/0b4a7-covid-19-learning-and-support-scheme-class-guidance-for-primary-and-special-schools/  </p><p>Covid-19 Learning and Support Scheme (CLASS) Guidance for Post Primary Schools: www.gov.ie/en/publication/31e9f-covid-19-learning-and-support-scheme-class-guidance-for-post-primary-schools/ </p><p>The amount of teaching time provided per child under the CLASS scheme is a matter for each school. There is therefore not an average amount of teaching time provided under this programme, by schools, per pupil. Rather schools allocate the most support to the pupils who have the greatest level of need.  </p><p>Because schools may draw down CLASS hours at any time over the 2021/22 school year, details of the total number of hours drawn down under this scheme, and total expenditure under this scheme, will therefore not be known until the school year has concluded.</p></reply>

However, based on the latest complete year of PRSI contribution data, 2019, there were 94,854 recipients, 4,888 of whom made a paid PRSI contribution in 2019, of which: </p>  <p>  - 30 made self-employed class contributions</p>  <p>  - 4,858 made non-self-employed class contributions</p>  <p>  - 10 made both self-employed and non-self-employed class contributions. </p>  <p>  The Department can not provide summary information on state pension non-contributory recipients holding occupational pensions as its systems do not differentiate between different types of private pension.</p>  <p>  In determining the eligibility of a state pension non-contributory applicant, the first &euro;30 per week of assessed means, from any source, including self-employment, is disregarded. In addition, a weekly earnings disregard from insurable employment (as an employee) of up to &euro;200 per week applies. This disregard is intended to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce. Apart from providing an incentive to take up employment, this approach recognises that persons in employment incur additional expenses such as travelling expenses, clothing and so forth, consequent to the employment.</p>  <p>  The rules applying to state pension non-contributory do not prohibit individuals from engaging in any form of self-employment; it is the means available from the profit from such self-employment (after allowing for authorised expenses) which determines the rate of pension payable, if any.</p>  <p>  The means assessment for the state pension non-contributory allows for "any expenses necessarily incurred in carrying on any form of self-employment&rdquo; to be disregarded. There is no exhaustive list of all allowable expenses in self-employed cases, since expenses vary with the nature and extent of the self-employment. This means that earnings from self-employment are assessed net of expenses incurred by the person concerned in the course of their work; for example, on petrol/diesel, purchase of equipment and raw materials and so forth.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the means testing criteria for state pension non-contributory would need to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s support for An Post is equally apparent.  We are in the process of renewing the contract for cash payment services with the company for another year.  The current agreement allows me, as Minister, to extend the term of the contract on an annual basis up to the end of 2025.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), and the need to ensure payments quickly reached the hundreds of thousands of people who lost their employment as a direct result of public health restrictions, necessitated paying the majority of applicants by direct fund transfer into their bank account (EFT).  This has been acknowledged by many stakeholders, groups and individual customers.</p>  <p>  When the Government had to introduce public health restrictions in 2020, all those in receipt of Jobseeker payments were given the option of being paid by EFT.  Only where jobseekers requested a change of payment method was their payment changed from the post office to EFT.  My Department did not recommend a change of payment method nor actively promote such a change among Jobseekers.  The process was driven by customer choice.</p>  <p>  This change in payment method also reflects a wider societal shift away from cash and is reflective of a natural year-on-year reduction of post office payments on all Departmental schemes.  It should also be noted that one in every five Jobseeker payments were paid via EFT prior to the pandemic. </p>  <p>  As the country emerges from the worst of the pandemic and PUP scheme recipients are gradually migrating over to Jobseekers&rsquo; payments, my officials are reviewing the Department&rsquo;s payment policy. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that a balance needs to be struck between the requirement to ensure that appropriate financial controls are in place while also considering the views of Social Welfare customers regarding their payment method choice.</p></reply>

My officials and I are currently finalising the detailed breakdown of how this funding will be used in 2022 and as such, I am not in a position as yet to share this, but I would hope to do so shortly. </p>  <p>  In general terms however, I can say that this additional funding will support the delivery of universal and targeted youth services nationwide, with a particular view to the role played by youth services in supporting mental wellbeing, fostering resilience and developing the social and personal competencies of young people, including those that are disadvantaged, marginalised or vulnerable. </p>  <p>  In recent years, funding for the provision of youth services has increased on an annual basis. Between 2016 and now moving into 2022, the annual current youth funding available to my Department will have increased from &euro;51.9 million to &euro;71.79 million. Including capital allocations, the total funding next year will be &euro;73 million.</p>  <p>  The additional funding secured for Youth Services is particularly important given the disproportionate impact Covid-19 has had on young people. This additional funding will allow us to re-engage young people in youth services, re-engage and train volunteers, and provide new youth services where needed.</p>  <p>  It is now more critical than ever that our young people are supported as they experience the social, economic, physical and mental health impacts of the pandemic. In recognition of the vital role played by youthwork services in providing such support to young people, funding levels have been maintained throughout the current challenging period.  This has enabled the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.  The increased funding in 2022 will enable DCEDIY to offer more supports to existing services, to help them reach more young people, and will enable the introduction of brand new services across the country. </p>  <p>  As we begin to move beyond the pandemic, I am committed to supporting this important sector, which has enormous value to the many young people involved and from a broader social and economic viewpoint. </p>  <p>  The Budget 2022 Expenditure Report set out the proposal for youth services funding in 2022.  Further details on the allocation of resources across youth services from my Department will be made available following publication of the Revised Estimates Volume for the Public Service (REV).</p></reply>

Ending Direct Provision and putting in place the new system with its focus on human rights, on not-for-profit delivery, and on integration from day one, requires a whole-of-Government approach. My Department is therefore working closely with key stakeholders across Government to plan, design, and implement the changes described in the White Paper. </p><p>I have appointed a Programme Board, including officials from relevant Government Departments and agencies, and independent members, to oversee the transition. So far, the Board has met four times since its establishment, and its next meeting is scheduled for 16 December.</p><p>As stated in the White Paper, my intention is to have the new system of supports and accommodation for international protection applicants operational by December 2024.  We have made good progress on this objective to date.  Working with the Housing Agency, my Department has begun to acquire the accommodation needed to implement the White Paper reforms. We are currently prioritising the acquisition of accommodation for Phase Two - that is, after people have completed their initial four months in a Reception and Integration Centre and move into the community.</p><p>We anticipate that the process of moving the first applicants into this accommodation will begin in 2022 and that it will accelerate over the following years as more properties come on stream.</p><p>A detailed implementation plan is being developed and has been reviewed by the Programme Board.  It is set out timelines for the different elements of the transition process.The planning process for capital projects including the Reception and Integration Centres, will be initiated in 2022. </p><p>It will take time to end Direct Provision and replace it with a new and very different system of accommodation and supports - grounded in human rights and delivered on a not-for-profit basis.

The panel&rsquo;s terms of reference are to:</p>  <p>  - Review the existing approach to funding ETBs to deliver FET by SOLAS in terms of its effectiveness in delivering on national objectives, facilitating ETB flexibility and autonomy in responding to regional needs, ensuring sustainability and quality, and driving performance.  </p>  <p>  - Identify and consider options regarding how that approach is developed in order to reflect the core principles that must underpin future funding of FET.</p>  <p>  - Make recommendations on an appropriate future approach to funding the sector, and on an implementation timeframe with moderating mechanisms to ensure a smooth transition to this approach, one that avoids any sudden or significant changes to current funding levels.</p>  <p>  Since appointment, the panel have undertaken extensive research, consulted with a wide range of stakeholders, and tested funding ideas and approaches via a series of workshops with ETBs. Although the process has been delayed by COVID restrictions, a draft report is currently being drafted by the panel and is expected to be submitted to SOLAS early next year.</p>  <p>  This review is an important enabler for the FET Strategy and I look forward to receiving the report and considering its findings and recommendations.</p></reply>

It has the largest ever housing budget in the history of the State. It aims to transform our housing system, with in excess of &euro;20bn in funding provided through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next five years to support these actions. My Department is working with the Department of Housing to support the implementation of this plan. A key part of this work is ensuring that our HEIs have access to the financing necessary to build affordable student accommodation.</p>  <p>  In 2017 legislation was commenced which empowered the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to lend directly to HEIs for the development of student accommodation. So far three universities - TCD, UCC and UCD have had a total of &euro;157 million in loans approved by the HFA, which will provide more than 1,400 new student bed spaces.</p>  <p>  In June I, along with my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, announced that &euro;75 million of financing had been successfully sourced for the Council of Europe Bank for the building of student accommodation in universities.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that, there are currently barriers to IoTs and TUs accessing the type of financing that is available to the traditional universities. Housing For All contains a commitment to support technological universities to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists.</p>  <p>  My Department and I are continuing to work with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and our HEIs to support them in progressing student accommodation plans.</p></reply>

A range of options are available from short courses targeted at awareness building, upskilling and reskilling programmes to full and part-time academic and vocational programmes. The curricula of many other programmes will also include elements and modules targeted to green skills and sustainability components.</p><p>In the further education and training sector, short courses are targeted at upskilling and increasing knowledge awareness for existing professionals. SOLAS is working to develop a strategy to support the Climate Action Plan and associated skills training at further education level. SOLAS&rsquo;s strategy on green skills is in development and they are actively engaging across a very broad range of internal, external and industry stakeholders to ensure tangible and appropriate FET responses are devised. Expenditure under the Green Skills Action Programme is not available as the programme has not been approved. However the National Recovery and Resilience Plan 2021 committed &euro;29M to the programme to include NZEB &amp;amp; Retrofit and &euro;10M to Green Skills Modules.</p><p>Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) training will continued to be delivered in short courses ranging from 1 &ndash; 4 Days to provide upskilling opportunities for the existing built environment workforce in for example in: </p><p>- NZEB Fundamentals</p><p>- Passive House &amp;amp; Airtightness-Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery</p><p>- Continuous Mechanical Extract Ventilation</p><p>- Intermittent Extract Ventilation </p><p>- Installation of ducts, plenums and diffusers </p><p>- Intake and Exhaust duct insulation and sealing</p><p>Longer training programmes 1 &ndash; 3 weeks will be offered to existing skilled, semi-skilled workers, construction professionals and new entrants to the construction/retrofitting sector in retrofitting external cladding, attic &amp;amp; wall insulation along with other areas that will be identified by the Training providers. </p><p>The WWETB National NZEB Training Centre is the first facility in Europe to offer a suite of trade-specific NZEB courses. On-site retrofit programmes are currently provided in Waterford Wexford ETB, Laois Offaly ETB and Mount Lucas National Construction Training Centre.  These training courses introduce participants to the legislative concepts required to meet the standards of NZEB in a flexible, responsive environment. </p><p>Currently, there are 648 students enrolled on NZEB and retrofitting programmes across the three centres. The majority of courses are three days in duration and are validated by City and Guilds. WWETB is continuing to develop their offering to meet the needs of the sector and are developing a blended model with 2 days online and one day in the training centre.  They have also commissioned the development of a pilot VR programme to support NZEB/retrofit training which is expected to be operational by year end.  </p><p>The percentage breakdown of the 4,550 retrofit and NZEB standard places to be provided by the end of 2022 will be determined by the uptake in programmes by existing construction professionals and the number of participants upskilling for the construction/retrofitting sector. It is not possible to project the percentages availing of these opportunities at this time.</p><p>A further three Centres of Excellence are being established in the Cork, Limerick Clare and Mayo Sligo Leitrim ETBs.  The establishment of the centres has been delayed due to COVID-19 impacts on the ETBs and are now due to be in place by Q4 2022. The location for each of the new Centres are:- </p><p>- Cork ETB: Fermoy, Co. Cork</p><p>- MSLETB: Collooney, Co. Sligo</p><p>- LCETB: TBC </p><p>SOLAS is actively engaging with the Education and Training Boards to finalise overall FET targets for ETBs under the 2022 Further Education and Training business planning process.  The allocation of places for NZEB and retrofitting programmes as outlined in Budget 2022 are under discussion as part of that process.</p><p>In the higher education sector, in addition to core education delivery, funding is provided under Springboard and the Human Capital Initiative to incentivise the delivery of programmes which support the development of professionals in areas such as building analysis and climate adaptation; sustainable building technology and retrofit, conservation and sustainability. Two innovation projects have commenced under the Human Capital Initiative (Pillar 3). These projects are directly supporting increased availability of skills development in the construction sector through the Digital Academy for Sustainable Built Environment (DASBE) in Limerick IT and the REEdl project in IT Tralee which is based on a world leading model of self-directed, project centric learning using Virtual Reality and Augmented reality (VR/AR) in supporting the education of student engineers along with access to world class research centres. Under Springboard+ 2021/22, there are 17 courses available in green skills and sustainability such as Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB), Bio-Energy, Clean Technologies and Electric Vehicle Technology. </p><p>Please see details of all the green skill and sustainability programmes running across the Tertiary Education system contained in attachment 1. </p><p>Skillnet Ireland also supports the construction sector through two national Construction-specific Skillnet training networks, as well as through multiple regional Skillnet training networks that assist construction businesses located in their respective regions. CIF and Skillnet Ireland, launched the Construction Professionals Skillnet in January 2020 to provide customised learning and development solutions to meet the specific professional learning needs of the construction industry. Programmes are currently available in areas such as Communications, Project Management, Sustainable Construction, Contracts and legal responsibilities. The Construction IT Alliance (CitA) Skillnet also facilitates the advancement of construction firms through digitalisation and the development of skillsets that enable businesses to adopt new and emerging information and communications technologies. The network primarily supports architecture, engineering, construction, and operations enterprises within the construction sector and has provided programmes such as Advanced BIM Management and a Higher Diploma in BIM over the last 12 months.</p></reply>

Certain sectors such as construction and electrical apprentices are paid agreed rates as set out within sectoral wage agreements to under Sectoral Employment Orders. </p><p>The State pays training allowances directly to apprentices in the 25 craft apprenticeships while attending off-the-job training in Phases 2, 4 and 6 of their seven phase apprenticeship. These allowances are paid by the ETBs through the Department of Education Shared Business Services and are funded through the NTF. </p><p>The National Minimum Wage is currently &euro;10.20 an hour for adult workers aged 20 and over. However workers under the age of 20 are subject to different rates of minimum pay depending on age as follows</p><p>- Under 18&euro;7.14 </p><p>- Aged 18&euro;8.16 </p><p>- Aged 19&euro;9.18</p><p>Apprentices in Phase 6 and 15 of the 25 Phase 4 cohorts receive training allowances in excess of the adult National Minimum Wage. Taking the current craft apprentice cohort in off-the-job training phase 2 or 4, the cost of training allowances is &euro;2.24m per week.  The estimated cost to the State of training allowance payments at the minimum wage at &euro;10.20 an hour is estimated at &euro;2.56m per week across phases 2 and 4, a difference of &euro;310k per week, or in the region of &euro;16m per annum.</p><p>It should be noted that 53% of currently registered craft apprentices are below the age of 20 and thus subject to lower minimum wage rates.  If the minimum wage rates were used to set training allowance rates, eight of the phase 2 apprenticeships would potentially receive a lower weekly rate of pay than currently, depending on age.</p></reply>

Apprenticeship provides a rapid route to employment while gaining a qualification and therefore is an important skills response for workers most impacted by sectoral closures and a potential need to reskill.   </p>  <p>  The introduction of the scheme was a key element in the Government response to the pandemic and supporting a rapid reopening of the economy.  The positive impacts of the support measures is evident in apprentice registrations with 2021 figures to the end of November showing 7,484 registrations &ndash; an increase of 29% on figures for the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID).  </p>  <p>  Given the continued growth of apprenticeship and key economic sectors the AIS will cease from end 2021. The allocation for the apprenticeship incentivisation scheme over 2020 and 2021 was &euro;26 million. Spend has been &euro;13.6 million. A further &euro;1.7m is in final stages of approval for payment. &euro;9m has been allocated to the scheme for 2022 to allow for second tranche payments and payments to employers of apprentices registered in late 2021. </p></reply>

Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the COVID-related shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to access off-the-job training.  As at the end of November, there were 11,382 craft apprentices waiting to start a phase of off-the-job training. Of these, 3,143 apprentices (27%) across the three phases have been scheduled and will begin training in December and January. </p>  <p>  &euro;20m capital investment has been supplemented by &euro;17m additional COVID-linked funding in 2022 to deliver an additional 4,000 off-the-job training phases (across phases 2, 4 and 6).   SOLAS, the HEA and education and training providers are continuing to work to ensure that craft apprentices are facilitated to complete their apprenticeship in as rapid a manner as is possible.  Measures include the reform of Phase 2 off-the-job training to facilitate a third intake per annum, an opt-in rapid employer assessment which is being piloted at Phase 7 (on-the-job) for those apprentices who have completed Phase 6 and who have spent more than four years in their apprenticeship. Further measures are being explored within the context of ensuring that all learning outcomes and quality assurance procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the end qualification is maintained.</p></reply>

Traditionally, ETBs have facilitated two intakes per year.  Significant reform efforts by the education and training bodies have resulted in a temporary restructure of Phase 2 craft apprenticeship delivery, delivering 18 week on-site presence, supplemented by additional theory elements of the course being delivered in a flexible manner (evenings/weekends and blended learning).  This will allow for a full additional intake for Phase 2 Carpentry &amp;amp; Joinery, Electrical and Plumbing apprentices in the coming year.</p>  <p>  Phases 4 and 6 are 10-12 weeks in duration and are delivered in Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities.  Scheduling of these phases follow the academic year with intakes scheduled in September, January and April of an academic year.  </p>  <p>  Additional places are continuing to come on-stream across the ETBs and HEIs as workspaces are becoming available from the 2021 capital investment. </p>  <p>  Since July, almost 3,500 apprentices have been brought into training, the majority just about to finish their phase.  SOLAS have scheduled another 3,143 apprentices to commence off-the-job training in December and January.</p>  <p>  &euro;20 million capital funding was allocated in 2021 to provide structural capacity to support the delivery of almost 4,000 additional craft apprentice places annually across further and higher education.  The 2021 budget allocation for apprenticeship is &euro;198.4m which includes the cost of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme in 2020 and 2021 as well &euro;12m Covid related costs for additional classes in 2021.  This compares to a 2020 allocation of &euro;169m which represents an increase of over 7%.  A further &euro;19m in COVID-related funding has been allocated for 2022 to deliver increased activity to reduce waiting lists for access to off-the-job training phases.</p></reply>

However, to address I recently met with management, staff and student representatives and the issue was discussed.</p>  <p>  Due to the diversity of our higher education institutions, and the broad range of activities they undertake and the different contexts and requirements applicable to examinations, it was agreed that a uniform or one size fits all approach would not be appropriate across the whole of higher education or indeed the tertiary sector more generally.</p>  <p>  Management bodies confirmed that they are actively looking at a range of approaches to ensure that end of term examinations will be safe, and that the requirements of students who may have Covid-19 or underlying health conditions can be addressed.

Issues arise for communities where vehicles are used on public, open spaces such as in housing estates, playing pitches or in public parks. </p><p>I can inform the Deputy that I chair the Anti-Social Behaviour Forum within my Department. One of the tasks of the Forum was to deliver proposals to Government for a community based approach to tackling this problem. While the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fundamental to addressing the misuse of scramblers and other vehicles, it was also highlighted to the Forum that engagement with communities and raising awareness are just as important.  </p><p>Raising awareness encompasses educating younger people of dangers to themselves and to others in using such vehicles and highlighting the dangers to parents who are considering buying such vehicles for their children. The Forum explored the opportunities of intervention and diversion from this type of activity. </p><p>Earlier this year, the Department of Justice invited applications for funding from Youth Diversion Projects who would act as the focus point for local consortiums for the development of proposals for community-based interventions to work with young people involved in the anti-social use of these vehicles and related crime and anti-social behaviour.</p><p>These funding provisions have so far enabled eight Youth Diversion Projects to obtain funding to work with young people involved in the misuse of these vehicles. The projects will be required to consult with other local interests, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to create a local consortium which will include the local authority. </p><p>Based on experience with existing initiatives, it is envisaged that the local authority partner is best placed to assist with the provision of tracks and related facilities. Each proposal submitted via the YDPs is assessed in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department. The programme will also encourage young people to engage positively to learn motorcycle skills, including maintenance, combined with relevant educational and personal development activities.</p><p>Separately, the Minister of Transport is examining provisions to strengthen the law in relation to the dangerous and antisocial off-road use of scramblers, quads and other similar vehicles. It is hoped that this combined approach of increased Garda powers to tackle the misuse of scramblers, together with the creation of alternative options for those who wish to use such vehicles safely and legally, will have a significant impact in tackling the problem. </p><p>The Department of Justice would welcome additional applications from other Youth Diversion Projects and is working with a number to support them in developing additional local scrambler initiatives. </p></reply>

This responsibility includes the allocation of funding in support of all activities, operations and deployment of personnel. </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels. Budget 2022 provides over &euro;2 billion in funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Since 2016 the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by approximately &euro;500m, or 33%. This has enabled 1,400 extra Garda&iacute; to be deployed, as well as continued investment in modern equipment. In addition, we have freed up 800 Garda&iacute; for front line policing work through the recruitment of Garda staff. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, Covid-19 restrictions on the Garda Training College in Templemore constrained recruitment and training for periods over the last 18 months. However, I am glad to confirm that 385 Garda&iacute; will be recruited this year and the funding provided for next year fully supports the sustained recruitment of Garda members and staff.</p><p>In particular, the funding provided includes provision for the recruitment of 800 new Garda recruits and 400 Garda staff in 2022 - an additional 1,200 personnel. The number of new recruits and new Garda staff envisaged means that we are on track to meet the Government&rsquo;s target of 15,000 sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 4,000 Garda staff as we approach the centenary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>This increase in the number of Garda members and staff will deliver significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide and improved services to the public generally. Redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and support roles will also continue next year, thus allowing highly trained Garda&iacute; to focus on frontline policing duties.  The organisation's capacity will be further strengthened by the recruitment of additional Garda staff, including specialist roles to support the investigation of crime and enhance the management of the organisation  <b><i>.</i></b></p><p>Budget 2022 provides an additional &euro;10.5 million for Garda operational expenditure &ndash; including provision for new mobile devices, equipment for a range of Garda specialist units and on-going training in relation to priority areas such as tackling sexual, domestic and gender-based violence. It also includes a specific once&ndash;off allocation of &euro;1.5 million to mark the centenary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022.</p><p>Budget 2022 also includes provision for a capital budget of &euro;147 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ICT and Building Programme and ongoing investment in the organisation&rsquo;s transport fleet. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, recognising the need to be visible and accessible in communities but also conscious of taking proactive actions to reduce their carbon footprint, will purchase an additional 100 mountain bikes and increased numbers of electric vehicles as part of an overall fleet management strategy.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p>  <p>  The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups on 18th November, to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.</p>  <p>  On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, concerning the number of persons on the waiting list for colonoscopy procedures in Letterkenny University Hospital, for routine and urgent referrals in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p>  <p>  The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups on 18th November, to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.</p>  <p>  On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of October 2021 there were 4,717 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,452 in October 2018.</p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular queries raised, regarding Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, as these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The extent of the involvement of Health Service Executive (HSE) personnel in the Scheme relates to making a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant meets the specified criteria for a Primary Medical Certificate, which is a requirement for the Scheme.</p><p>Following a Supreme Court decision of June 2020, the assessment process for Primary Medical Certificates was suspended at the request of the Minister for Finance.  On the enactment of the Finance Act 2020 which provided for the medical criteria in primary legislation, the Minister for Health instructed the HSE that assessments could recommence from 1 January, 2021.</p><p>The ability to hold assessments for the Scheme has been impacted by, among other things, the public health restrictions in place and the role of the HSE Community Medical Doctors in the roll-out of the COVID vaccination programme.</p><p>If an applicant's case very clearly meets the strict criteria that govern the granting of the certificate, the Community Medical Doctors may be in a position to grant it, with supporting documentation from a Consultant.  However the majority of applications are not clear cut and would need an in-person examination to make an adjudication.</p><p>Good progress on the assessment process has been made. The HSE has recently confirmed that a total of 1,078 assessments were undertaken in Quarter 3, 2021, which compares with a combined total of 1,272 assessments undertaken in Quarters 1 and 2, 2021.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. </p>  <p>  Gestational diabetes is not a permanent or long-term illness and is, therefore, not covered by the LTI scheme. There are currently no plans to make specific provision for gestational diabetes under any new or existing health scheme. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs. </p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The maximum payable under the DPS will be further reduced to &euro;100 per month from 1 January 2022. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. </p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. </p></reply>

This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and NTPF. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.  </p>  <p>  The 2021 National Service Plan recognised the need for an unprecedented expansion of the permanent health workforce through permanent appointments. Funding has been provided for an increase to approximately 135,655 WTE across the health service by December 2021, which is an increase of 15,838 WTE over funded 2020 levels. There is significant workforce recruitment underway. The HSE Pay and Numbers Strategy identifies the specific roles and grades to be hired.</p>  <p>  In relation to diabetes services in Cork Hospital and the transition from the paediatric to adult diabetes services, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.  Childhood obesity is a key priority under the Policy, as is reducing the inequalities seen in obesity rates.Actions taken under the OPAP to date with a particular reference to childhood obesity include the introduction of Nutrition Standards for Schools, the Healthy Eating Guidelines for 1 to 4 Year-Olds and Children's Food Pyramid, and the START communications campaign to combat childhood obesity.</p><p>The OPAP provides for a mid-term review to be carried out, which will lead to a refreshed and updated Plan with a revised set of actions for the remaining lifetime of the OPAP.  This review provides the opportunity to consider developments and new evidence since the publication of the OPAP, and to assess which elements might best be further progressed by legislation or by other means.</p><p>The review will be informed by an evaluation of the OPAP which is being carried out by the Health Research Board Centre for Health and Diet Research, University College Cork.  This process has included an assessment through an online survey by numerous experts and stakeholders, and the final report is expected to be received shortly.  A strong evidence base will be required for any new legislative measures, and the review of the OPAP will build on the work already underway to identify gaps in the implementation of the Plan, including where actions need to be progressed, whether by legislative or other means, and where further research is required.  This will input into what measures should be included in a Public Health Obesity Act, and stakeholder consultation will also be an important element of the considerations in relation to this.</p><p>In relation to the issues around advertising and marketing of unhealthy foods aimed at children, Ireland is currently co-leading a Work Package in this area under the EU Joint Action &ldquo;Best ReMaP&rdquo; (Best practices in Reformulation, Marketing and public Procurement).  The title of the Work Package is &ldquo;Best practices in reducing marketing of unhealthy food products to children and adolescents&rdquo;.  Work has been underway under this Joint Action since October 2020 and there are 17 Member States participating.</p><p>In relation to broadcasting, the rules around programming, advertising and sponsorship are contained in the Childrens&rsquo; Commercial Communications Code (CCCC).  This is a statutory code with its basis in section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The current version of the CCCC has been in operation since 2013, and a review was carried out by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and published in 2020.  The process for consultation in respect of a new version of the CCCC has not yet begun, but the Department of Health will certainly contribute to that process.</p></reply>

The Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) was established in April 2020 as a temporary, administrative measure to respond to the challenges being faced by the nursing home sector at the start of the pandemic, and was extended twice beyond its original planned end date. </p>  <p>  In broad terms, TAPS had substantially fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes to address COVID-19 and therefore it was appropriate to end the standard assistance element of the scheme in June 2021. From June onwards, in recognition of the residual risk presented by the virus, Minister Donnelly and I have agreed to the continued availability of the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme until the end of this year. This will ensure that contingency is available in the event of an outbreak.</p>  <p>  According to the most recent available HSE data, from 24 November, over 8,172 claims had been processed, with some &euro;120.7 million euro of direct financial support provided to the sector. Due to the extension of outbreak assistance, claims continue to be received and paid; &euro;1.75m has been paid to nursing homes under 75 separate claims for outbreak assistance since the end of June.  In total, &euro;134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  There continue to be a number of outbreaks reported in nursing homes each week; however, current data suggests there may be a reduction in the number of associated cases per outbreak. The State has continued to prioritise residents of nursing homes in the response to COVID-19, including through the successful and early roll-out of the vaccine programme to nursing home residents. This prioritisation is continuing with the roll-out of booster vaccines to nursing home residents, which is expected to be completed by early December. The roll-out of booster vaccines has provided important protection for residents -  booster vaccines for the over 65's commenced at the beginning of October and were substantially completed within a three week period.</p>  <p>  As the pandemic has continued, many further support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been made available through the Health Service Executive (HSE), including the provision of PPE on a no-cost basis, the implementation of serial testing, the support and engagement of COVID-19 response teams and public health teams, the temporary accommodation scheme for nursing home staff and further supports. Many of these supports will continue to be provided by the HSE for the foreseeable future.</p></reply>

The aim of Ireland&rsquo;s Eco-Scheme will be to reward farmers for undertaking actions beneficial to the climate, environment, water quality and biodiversity. I have decided to allocate 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s Direct Payments envelope to Eco-Schemes annually, which equates to approximately &euro;297 million per annum.</p><p>Eco-Schemes are mandatory for Member States but voluntary for farmers. Ireland's Eco-Scheme will be delivered in accordance with Article 31 of the CAP Strategic Plan Regulation and will be costed in accordance with Article 31 (7) (b) and based on cost incurred and income foregone. Farmers will apply annually for Eco-Schemes from 2023 on at the same time as they submit their BISS application.  </p><p>There are currently eight agricultural practices within Ireland's Eco-Scheme. A farmer must undertake two agricultural practices to receive their Eco-Scheme payments. The current eight practices are: -</p><p>Space for Nature</p><p>Extensive Livestock Production,</p><p>Limiting Chemical Nitrogen Usage,</p><p>Planting of Native Trees and hedges </p><p>Use of a GPS-controlled fertiliser spreader and or GPS controlled sprayer, </p><p>Soil Sampling and Appropriate Liming on all eligible hectares, </p><p>Enhanced Crop Diversification, and</p><p>Sowing of a Multi Species Sward. </p><p>In terms of measures relating to hedgerows, existed hedgerows will count towards a farmers &quot;space for nature&quot; <i>in Agricultural Practice 1</i>whether that is 4% for conditionality or 7% or 10% for Eco-Schemes. Where a farmer delivers 10% Space for Nature features on their farm, that will be counted as two actions for Eco-Schemes. This agricultural practice will ensure a value is attached to all qualifying features including hedgerows that make up GAEC 8 or &quot;Space for Nature&quot;. </p><p>Hedgerows are also an integral element of <i>Agricultural Practice 4 Planting of Native Trees and or Hedges. </i>Farmers can opt to plant three native trees per eligible hectare or one metre of hedgerow per eligible hectare. Where a farmer selects to plant twice the commitment, i.e. six trees per eligible hectare or two metres of hedgerow per eligible hectare, that will count as two actions for Eco-Schemes.</p><p>My Department is currently in the process of finalising the design of the Eco-Scheme for inclusion in Ireland's CAP Strategic Plan which must be submitted to the European Commission by 31 December 2021. I have been very clear that Eco-Scheme actions must be straightforward and practical for farmers. </p><p>In addition, the actions must be administratively straightforward for farmers and for my Department to ensure that Eco-Scheme payments can issue promptly. </p><p>My Department must also be able to audit and control all agricultural practices so that effective reassurance can be provided that this EU funded scheme is being properly run. Crucially the actions must deliver positive environmental benefit. </p></reply>

Following engagement with all those involved, I have decided to defer the implementation of the element requiring anti-parasitic medicines to be supplied on foot of a veterinary prescription, until 1st June 2022. This will enable all stakeholders make the necessary business and/or infrastructural adjustments to ensure compliance with the Regulations, and ensure farmers are not disadvantaged. </p>  <p>  I have set out a clear roadmap for implementing key elements within the new Regulations; these include: </p>  <p>  1. The new requirements regarding the prescribing of antimicrobials, including antibiotics and medicated feed, will come into effect on January 28th 2022.</p>  <p>  2. The mandatory requirement to use the new National Veterinary Prescription System (NVPS) is deferred until 1st June 2022. Veterinary practitioners can continue to issue paper-based prescriptions in the current format until then.</p>  <p>  3. The NVPS will be available for voluntary use by vets from the end of January onwards, helping ensure that prescribers and dispensers are familiar with the system when its use becomes compulsory.</p>  <p>  4. Prescriptions for anti-parasitic medicines issued by vets after 1st June will be valid for a maximum period of 12-months. Anti-parasitic medicines can then be purchased by the farmer via the NVPS from his preferred supplier at any time throughout the period that the prescription is valid.</p>  <p>  I am also in the process of finalising a proposal to introduce a large-scale Targeted Advisory Service on Animal Health (TASAH) programme specifically focused on parasite control on farms in 2022. This measure will allow farmers engage a specifically trained vet to provide advice on parasite control measures in their herd, at no cost to the farmer.</p>  <p>  I recognise that the new Veterinary Medicines Regulation means significant change for farmers, vets, pharmacists and licensed merchants &ndash; all of whom have, and will, play key roles in upkeeping the health of our livestock. An overarching objective of the Regulations is to address the issue of development of resistance to anti-microbial medicines and also anti-parasitic medicines for the long term benefit of farmers and society generally.  </p>  <p>  I have consulted widely and listened to a range of voices on this topic, and I believe the steps I have outlined will ensure that we address the challenge of anti-microbial and anti-parasitic resistance and support the health and welfare of our livestock, thus improving productivity. Farmers will continue to have access to a range of sales points, thus helping competition and licensed merchants will continue to be a trusted source of animal health products.</p></reply>

Funding has always been subject to available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.   </p>  <p>  Between the years 2010-2020, Kerry County Council has received funding of &euro;1.9m under this programme.  In May, I was pleased to announce a 35% increase in the funding being made available to Local Authorities from the 2021 Programme. Kerry County Council securing over &euro;200,000 to support three projects.  </p>  <p>  No application for funding in relation to Minard Pier was received under this year&rsquo;s programme.  Should any application be submitted by Kerry County Council in relation to Minard Pier under any future programme, it will be given due consideration taking into account the terms and conditions of the particular scheme, the priority attached by the Council and available funding. </p>  <p>  Recently, I received the Report of the Seafood Sector Task Force which makes recommendations to address the impacts on the fishing sector and coastal communities of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  The Taskforce has specifically recommended an initiative of significant investment in publicly owned marine infrastructure to assist in diversification of economic opportunities to offset the effects of the TCA, particularly in communities dependent on fishing activity.   Officials in my Department are actively engaged in examining what kind of mechanisms could be developed to leverage the Brexit Adjustment Reserve funding that Ireland has received for this purpose. </p></reply>

The recommendations of the ANIT Committee, if they were to be implemented in full, would be particularly challenging.  This report will next be presented to a plenary session of the  European Parliament in January, seeking endorsement by the Parliament.</p>  <p>  The European Commission is currently reviewing European animal welfare legislation including the rules for the transport of animals. This review by the Commission will result in legislative proposals, which are expected in 2023. </p>  <p>  It can be expected that the report of the ANIT Committee will feed into this review. The Commission has repeatedly said however that legislative proposals will be made on the basis of the best available scientific evidence, and it is vital that this will be the case. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with this process to communicate the challenges that these recommendations will place on Irish farmers.  </p>  <p>  Teagasc is currently engaged in research in relation to the welfare of animals being transported and the outcome of this scientific research will help to inform the debate in this area.</p>  <p>  It is essential however that stakeholders in the Irish agriculture sector take note of these findings. </p>  <p>  It is important that stakeholders further advance their collaborative efforts to ensure the welfare of all animals transported, mitigate the risk of any sector being overly dependent on live exports. Ourdairy sector, has built a reputation on producing a top-quality calf, and we take tremendous steps in transporting them safely. Huge credit must go to our farmers and exporters in this regard. </p>  <p>  The export of animals is strictly regulated by my Department in accordance with existing EU law and the Irish system of controls is publicly acknowledged to have incorporated meaningful measures that ensure high standards of animal welfare on farm, and at every stage during transport.</p></reply>

This programme provides small grants to community groups to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas. The 2021 CEP was launched in May last with funding of &euro;4.5m, and is now closed to applications. It is intended that the 2022 CEP will open again next year.</p>  <p>  The CEP is administered by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area, on behalf of my Department.  The fund covers the purchase of equipment (such as defibrillators). </p>  <p>  Last month I also launched the Community Activities Fund which will allow groups apply for funding to carry out necessary repairs and to purchase equipment within their community. This scheme is part of the CEP and is also administered by the LCDCs. </p>  <p>  The LEADER Programme is also capital in nature and the purchase of community defibrillators may be eligible for LEADER funding. Groups should contact their Local Action Group to determine eligibility.</p></reply>

The Rural Development Programmes agreed by each Member State with the EU Commission were designed to correspond to specified Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) programming periods.  The CAP programming periods in turn correspond to the EU's budgetary cycle.  The Rural Development Programme will now be replaced by each Member State&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan.  </p><p>Funding under the LEADER programme is provided on a programming period basis rather than an annual basis which provides greater flexibility for managing the budget.</p><p>The LEADER allocation for the 2007 to 2013 CAP programming period was almost &euro;400 million. This was subsequently revised in 2013, due to a downturn in the national economy, to &euro;377m on foot of the agreement by the EU Commission of a formal amendment to the 2007-2013 RDP.</p><p>The 2014-2020 LEADER programme had a total funding allocation of &euro;250 million. </p><p>The next CAP programming period was due to run from 2021 to 2027.  However, due to delays in agreeing the required regulations at EU level, a transitional period was agreed for the years 2021 and 2022.  &euro;70m has been assigned to LEADER in this transitional period. An indicative allocation of &euro;180m has recently being announced for the LEADER programme for the years 2023 to 2027.  This means LEADER funding for the 7 year period from 2021-2027 will be maintained at the same level as 2014-2020 Programme of &euro;250m. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has introduced a wide range of new funding streams for rural communities in recent years such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and more. All of these programmes support rural communities across the country and very much complement the LEADER Programme. </p><p>Table 1 below details the funding allocation for each of the programming periods and a breakdown of the respective EU Commission and National Exchequer contributions.</p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Breakdown of LEADER Funding Allocations 2007 to 2027</b></p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Programming period</th>       <th>Total Funding Allocation</th>       <th>EU Commission Funding</th>       <th>National Exchequer Funding</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2007-2013 (Original allocation)</td>       <td>&euro;400m</td>       <td>&euro;276m</td>       <td>&euro;124m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2007-2013 (Revised allocation)</td>       <td>&euro;377m</td>       <td>&euro;276m</td>       <td>&euro;101m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014-2020</td>       <td>&euro;250m</td>       <td>&euro;157m</td>       <td>&euro;93m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021-2022 Transitional programme</td>       <td>&euro;70m</td>       <td>&euro;51.4m</td>       <td>&euro;18.6m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2023-2027</td>       <td>&euro;180m</td>       <td>&euro;77.9m</td>       <td>&euro;102.1m</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>
