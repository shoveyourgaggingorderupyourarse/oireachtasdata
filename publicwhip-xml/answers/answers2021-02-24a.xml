The <i>Building Blocks</i>Phase (6 months&rsquo; duration);</p><p>2. The <i>Launching </i>Phase (6 months&rsquo; duration);</p><p>3. The <i>Scaling</i>Phase (18 months&rsquo; duration); and</p><p>4. The <i>Consolidation</i>Phase (12 &ndash; 18 months&rsquo; duration currently envisaged).</p><p>The first two phases of <i>A Policing Service for our Future </i>(the <i>Building Blocks</i>and <i>Launching</i>Phases) have been completed and much has already been achieved. For example:</p><p>- The roll-out of a new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide;</p><p>- An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a Human Rights Unit and re-established the Strategic Human Rights Advisory Committee;</p><p>- The National Security Analysis Centre (NSAC) has been established; and</p><p>- The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2019 has been enacted which gives Garda&iacute; access to the Workplace Relations Commission for the first time and provides for a modern industrial relations framework within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>There has also been progress on legislative reform, in particular, legislation is being drafted relating to:</p><p>- the use of recording devices (including body worn cameras);</p><p>- the codification of legislation defining police powers of arrest, search and detention; and</p><p>- a new coherent framework for the governance and oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>These measures and achievements represent only some of the wide range of actions being progressed under APSFF.</p><p>Progress since early 2020 has been impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The third phase of the implementation of <i>A Policing Service for our Future </i>&ndash; the <i>Scaling </i>Phase &ndash; was originally scheduled to commence in early 2020. However, as the Scaling Phase was being finalised, COVID-19 and the response required, became a factor to be considered. </p><p>I have been encouraged to see the responsiveness and flexibility shown by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with the demands of this unprecedented situation. </p><p>The third phase of <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>&ndash; the <i>Scaling </i>Phase &ndash; commenced in October 2020. This is the critical phase of the programme of reform, during which the programme gains momentum.

This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across a range of different information campaigns.</p><p>The overall communications strategy for Covid-19 is based on a coordinated response that ensures maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community. This aligns with both World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasise the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. </p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals. </p><p>Campaigns have included national and local radio, national and regional newspapers and social elements across different platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok.</p><p>Last Spring a number of campaigns were run as restrictions were initially imposed at the onset of the pandemic in order to explain the measures and to reinforce public health messages. Other Campaigns focussed on targeted sectors including the Business Sector, the postponement of the Leaving Certificate, the Return to Work Campaigns and Community Wellbeing.</p><p>In May of last year, the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopen Society and Business was published and a communications campaign was run to explain the different phases of the Roadmap.</p><p>During Summer 2020 the Jobs Stimulus Plan was announced by the Government and a Campaign was run which focussed on restoring confidence and investment in the recovery.</p><p>In Autumn Campaigns aimed at Community Wellbeing and Keeping Well and reinforcing public health messaging were run.</p><p>The AntiViral Campaign, launched in December, aims to engage with those aged 18-24, recognising that they have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Also in December, there were campaigns to inform citizens of the advice for having a safe Christmas with family and friends, and guidance on shopping safely, to reinforce public health messaging. This campaign is a way to demonstrate the positive role that our young people are playing in beating back this virus. It has had over 5.7 million interactions on the social platforms and reached over 300,000 people in that age demographic. The AntiViral hashtag had over 1.1 million views and the Campaign&rsquo;s positive sentiment was measured at over 60%.</p><p>It is essential that citizens, business owners and communities are informed of the decisions being made by Government, and campaigns are developed and implemented to make the public aware of these decisions.</p><p>Data from 25 of the Campaigns advertised in National press show an average reach of 49%, with 17 of these reaching over 50%. The average readership for the 25 campaigns was 1.9 million (with 16 of the 25 campaigns having a readership of over 2 million). Readership figures for regional newspapers is over 1.5 million for each campaign. Radio advertising had an average audience reach of 79%, with 19 of the campaigns advertised on radio reaching over 80%. </p><p>Digital display advertising was used in 13 campaigns, with a combined audience reach of over 33 million. This is an average of 2.6 million impressions, with six of the campaigns reaching over 3 million citizens.</p><p>Of 19 campaigns analysed that used Social media advertising, an average of 4.9 million impressions were achieved, with a high of 16.1 million impressions for the Publication of the Roadmap campaign. <table>    <tr>       <th>Covid-19 Advertising Costs 2020</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Campaign:</td>       <td>Advertising in publications</td>       <td>Broadcast Advertising</td>       <td>Online Banner Advertising</td>       <td>Social Media advertising</td>       <td>Production costs</td>       <td>Total</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Emergency Business Supports</td>       <td>&euro;229,784</td>       <td>&euro;253,141</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;9,422</td>       <td>&euro;492,347</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Use of Outdoor/Public Spaces</td>       <td>&euro;140,178</td>       <td>&euro;264,855</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;12,983</td>       <td>&euro;418,016</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>14 Day Restrictions</td>       <td>&euro;135,291</td>       <td>&euro;323,281</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;5,064</td>       <td>&euro;13,407</td>       <td>&euro;477,043</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Community Call</td>       <td>&euro;578,741</td>       <td>&euro;1,061,445</td>       <td>&euro;100,520</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;33,918</td>       <td>&euro;1,774,624</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Business Supports -

The WRC has discretion to extend the 52 week time limit to 104 weeks  in certain circumstances.</p><p>In a layoff situation a person has not permanently lost their job, the layoff is not a dismissal or a termination of employment and therefore the 52 week time limit does not apply.  </p><p>There are separate provisions in relation to the right of an employee to claim redundancy following certain periods of layoff and short time work.  These provisions are currently suspended by Section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 in respect of layoff and short-time work situations which have arisen due to Covid-19.  This was done in order to help maintain the employee/employer relationship during the Covid closures, to help ensure businesses survive and that permanent job losses and insolvency situations are avoided as much as possible.  </p><p>Those employees on layoff due to Covid are paid an enhanced unemployment benefit - the Pandemic Unemployment Payment<b>.</b>Employees who have been placed on short-time work may qualify for short-time work support from the Department of Social Protection.

The payment is made in respect of the days of work that have been lost.</p><p>Finally, the Customer Service section of the Workplace Relations Commission operate a telephone helpline at 1890 808090 and one of their functions is to assist employees in relation to their concerns or complaints regarding their employment rights.</p></reply>

In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. Full details are available here at: </p><p>Budget 2021 overall provides a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build resilience and help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the Credit Guarantee Scheme. Changes were made to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the EWSS, increasing the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. The EWSS is now extended by Government to end of June 2021, as is the rates waiver which will be of benefit to wet pubs.</p><p>My colleague, Minister Heather Humphreys T.D., Minister for Social Protection announced the doubling of the PUP threshold to &euro;960 over an eight-week period. This will help people to restart their businesses when it is safe to do so and allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs. The PUP is now extended by Government to end of June 2021.  </p><p>We have introduced a reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% until the end of 2021 which will benefit the hospitality sector, together with a range of additional public capital investment measures to support the domestic economy. </p><p>The Revenue Commissioners' COVID Restrictions Support Scheme offers a temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels by up to &euro;5,000 per week. Th Government has extended the CRSS to end June which will be of continued direct benefit to wet pubs.  </p><p>On 9th February last, I announced a new &euro;60m Scheme, called the COVID-19 Business Aid Scheme (CBAS) that is being developed to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government&rsquo;s other existing schemes and to help with fixed costs.  Wholesalers, suppliers, caterers and events companies down 75% or more in turnover will benefit, including those that commenced at the end of 2019 may be eligible.  </p><p>We are committed to helping businesses respond to the economic challenges arising from the pandemic with a particular focus on firms that do not qualify for the weekly CRSS grant from the Revenue Commissioners or existing sectoral schemes in areas such as the arts, transport and tourism. </p><p>This new CBAS will help some businesses that are not eligible for existing grants, largely due to the fact that the premises they operate from have not been closed to the public. We estimate that this will help approximately 7,500 businesses. While the grant is modest it will be of substantial assistance to smaller businesses with some of their fixed costs like rent, utilities and security.  </p><p>I will continue to work with my colleagues to identify practical actions and to regularly review supports available to assist businesses.  </p></reply>

As advised in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 37 of 10 February 2021, the Finance Act 2015 introduced obligations for relevant companies to report to the Revenue Commissioners. </p><p>The next COMPET Council meeting will be an Informal Video Conference on 25 February 2021 where the Proposal for Public Country by Country Reporting will be for Policy Debate.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s opposition to this file proceeding in COMPET Council is a principled position shared by a number of other Member States reflecting the advice of the Council Legal Service (CLS) that the legal basis for this Proposal should be Taxation (Article 115 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), and therefore, should be considered by ECOFIN Council. This measure should have the benefit of tax expertise to ensure that it is consistent with existing reporting requirements and, importantly, with the international cooperation and exchange of information arrangements, which are based on confidentiality. Tax experts are best placed to ensure that international efforts to collect income tax from multinational corporations will not be undermined by new measures. </p><p>As I stated in my reply of 10 February last, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann adopted a Reasoned Opinion in June 2016 which also shares this view that the proposed Directive is a tax matter and does not meet the principle of subsidiarity.  The Reasoned Opinion is available at 2016-06-30_report-on-com-2016-198_en.pdf (oireachtas.ie).</p><p>My colleague the Minister for Finance leads on tax policy for Ireland. Ireland has long been a supporter of, and a beneficiary of, tax transparency.  Ireland has consistently implemented the necessary measures to ensure we are up to date with international best practices on tax transparency and exchange of information<b></b>negotiated at the OECD. We have also supported the parallel EU efforts through agreement of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) in the field of Taxation, and in December 2020 agreed new provisions for automatic exchange of information in respect of digital platforms.  This covers administrative cooperation between EU Member States on tax matters, and automatic exchange of tax rulings, financial account data, and mandatory disclosure of cross-border tax arrangements.</p><p>Of the 78 jurisdictions reviewed to date by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (OECD), Ireland is one of only a small number of jurisdictions to have been found to be fully compliant with new international best practice.</p><p>The current regime for country by country (CbC) reporting gives tax administrations a global picture of the operations of MNE Groups.  Tax authorities may use this information to perform high-level transfer pricing risk assessments and to evaluate other Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) related risks.</p><p>The exchange of CbC Reports requires that jurisdictions must have the necessary laws in place to require Reporting Entities to file a CbC Report; infrastructure to ensure the appropriate confidentiality and data safeguards standards as specified in the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters are met; and a qualifying competent authority agreement must be in effect.</p><p>A qualifying competent authority agreement is defined in the BEPS Action 13 Final Report as an agreement that is between authorised representatives of those jurisdictions that are party to an International Agreement (i.e., a Double Tax Agreement, Tax Information Exchange Agreement or the Multilateral Convention for Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters) and that requires the automatic exchange of CbC Reports between the party jurisdictions.</p><p>In most cases, jurisdictions have signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (&ldquo;MCAA&rdquo;) for the exchange of CbC Reports. As at December 2020, 89 jurisdictions (including Ireland) had signed the MCAA and it is open to all jurisdictions to do so.  A list of the jurisdictions that have signed up to the MCAA can be found on the OECD website: Activated exchange relationships for Country-by-Country reporting - OECD.</p></reply>

I encouraged employers, employees and unions to engage with this consultation and make their views known. The consultation process saw significant engagement and we received a total of 118 submissions. There is a wide range of views and suggestions from a good mix of stakeholders and all views are being taken into account in developing the scheme.  I also continue to engage with the social partners on this matter via the LEEF subgroup on Employment and Enterprise. </p>  <p>  We know there are implications, so policy decisions and options have to be worked through properly.

The proposers argue that this would allow countries to scale up the manufacture of such products.</p>  <p>  International Trade is a competence of the EU under the Treaties and in exercising that competence, the European Commission engages fully with the Member States through a variety of Committees and Working Parties/Groups, including on Intellectual Property. </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s current position on the proposed waiver is that the WTO international agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) allows countries the flexibility to respond to the concerns raised by India and South Africa.  Specifically, the TRIPS agreement allows compulsory licensing which is when a government permits someone else to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.</p>  <p>  The EU considers that the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global access to COVID vaccines, is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently championed collaborative responses to the pandemic, with a focus on ensuring that the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are served by our collective effort. As a member of the global health community, Ireland continues to play an active role in ensuring fair and equitable access to vaccines for all. This includes supporting the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, to develop, produce and equitably distribute effective technologies in the COVID-19 global response.  </p></reply>

I fully appreciate that it is one of the industries worst affected and for the longest and know that as we enter a second year of restrictions many in the sector must be fearing for their future. I do hope that once the pandemic is over the wedding sector will have a number of good years with so many weddings postponed. In the meantime, the Government wants to make sure as many businesses as possible survive to see that day.</p>  <p>  The financial support the Government is providing businesses and workers affected by the pandemic is unprecedented. Almost a million people of working age are now in receipt of weekly payments including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), Employment Wage Subsidy (EWSS) and Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance. Support for business includes the weekly CRSS payment for businesses forced to close their doors to the public, reduced VAT rates, a commercial rates holiday, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme as well as low cost loans.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the &euro;7 billion July Stimulus of enterprise measures, which includes the Wage Subsidy Scheme extended through 2021, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst self-employed. We are providing for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include repayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme funds owed by employers and preliminary tax obligations for adversely affected businesses.</p>  <p>  As announced in the July Stimulus, the Enterprise Support Grant was extended to assist eligible self-employed, including sole traders, who exit the PUP or jobseekers schemes, to re-start their business. Further information is available at www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  On the 9th of December, following engagement with the Arts sector and other self-employed sectors my colleague Minister Heather Humphreys T.D., Minister for Social Protection, announced the doubling of the PUP threshold from the current &euro;480 over four weeks to &euro;960 over an eight-week period effective immediately. This measure is to assist those who are trying to restart their businesses and will allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs without losing their entitlement to the PUP.</p>  <p>  The Government also announced the provision of support of &euro;50m for the live entertainment sector in Budget 2021. This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country. The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders. It will also be informed by the pilot live performance scheme in 2020 which is being rolled out now.</p>  <p>  The three main schemes, the CRSS, EWSS and PUP compare favourably with any other packages on offer in other countries. The new scheme, announced this week, the COVID Business Aid Scheme (CBAS) will provide funding of up to &euro;8,000 for those businesses that are in receipt of a rates bill from their local authority. While the grant is modest, it will help smaller businesses in particular to cover these costs &ndash; rent, insurance, utilities, security.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the scheme in Scotland and the Government is very much open to proposals from the wedding sector as to how we can help further. However, Government schemes to support businesses are generally designed to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided and it is not possible to provide compensation for loss of personal income or profits. </p>  <p>  My colleagues, Minister Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht and Minister Charlie McConalogue, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be able to provide more specific details on the events and hospitality industry and details on supports for the food sector respectively.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the 2015 Act, the Labour Court issues a statutory report to me as Minister following an examination of the relevant economic sector and submissions made by interested parties. The recommended SEO provisions are given statutory footing under Chapter 3 of the 2015 Act. </p>  <p>  The most recent Sectoral Employment Order (SEO) for the Construction Sector came into effect on 1 October 2019.  The Order fixes the statutory minimum rates of pay and other conditions for example, sick pay and pension entitlements for craftspeople, construction operatives and apprentices employed in the construction sector. Any employer in that sector has a legal duty to comply, at a minimum, with those terms. </p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an office under the aegis of this Department. The WRC is a statutory office and is independent in the exercise of its functions. The role of the WRC is to achieve compliance with employment legislation.

Employees whose rights under an SEO have not been complied with can refer the matter to the WRC for investigation. </p>  <p>  On the 23 June 2020, the High Court ruled the SEO making powers as invalid and struck down the parent legislation under which they were made as unconstitutional contrary to Article 15.2.1.

The regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy.  However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations. </p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit. These lists undergo twice yearly evidence based reviews which is guided by available research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS and includes a public consultation process . Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the relevant policy Department and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department. The Departments of Education and now the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Innovation, Research and Science are active members of the Interdepartmental Group.  </p>  <p>  Changes to the occupation lists are considered where there are no suitable Irish/EEA nationals available, development opportunities are not undermined, genuine skills shortages exist rather than a recruitment or retention problem and Government education, training and economic development policies are supported. In 2015 was the last time that two occupations were removed from the Critical Skills Occupations List. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that it is essential that Irish enterprise has access to high-quality, adaptable and flexible talent. In order to meet this demand, the Government is committed to building and retaining a highly skilled workforce to serve the needs of the economy.  This goal is set out under the framework of an overarching skills development strategy, Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, which sets out a vision of how Ireland can continue to develop relevant skills and ensure that the supply of skills is activated and effectively used.</p>  <p>  This is particularly important in the context of the pandemic, which has accelerated some deep structural shifts that were already in train across the economy, particularly when it comes to the twin transitions- digital and green. We know that many of the jobs that exist today may not exist by the end of this decade, but we also know there will be new jobs and new occupations and new businesses.</p>  <p>  The sophisticated skills architecture established in Ireland is key in identifying and responding to skills gaps as identified by enterprise and education and training providers. It constitutes the following elements:</p>  <p>  National Skills Council (NSC): The NSC was established in 2017. It provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates prioritisation of identified skills needs, while at the same time enhancing education and training provider responses to and delivery of these identified needs. The Council draws on the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS, and the Regional Skills Fora.</p>  <p>  Regional Skills Fora: A network of 9 Regional Skills Fora fosters close co-operation at regional level between education and training providers and regional enterprise. The Fora provide a cohesive education-led structure for employers and the further education and higher education system to work together in building the skills needs of their regions.</p>  <p>  Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN): The EGFSN is an independent, non-statutory body, which includes representatives from the business community, trade unions, and a number of Government Departments and agencies. It identifies the skills required by enterprise across occupations and sectors, as well as providing information to education and training providers to allow them to support the alignment of programmes with employers&rsquo; needs. My Department provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support.</p>  <p>  The Government is supporting participation in upskilling and reskilling through a range of education and training programmes informed by this labour market and skills intelligence, which are funded through the National Training Fund. These include Skillnet Ireland, the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s Springboard+ programme, apprenticeships and digital upskilling programmes such as SOLAS&rsquo;s Skills to Advance and Skills to Compete. The National Training Fund is also supporting an annual &euro;60 million investment in the Higher Education system, through the Human Capital Initiative.</p>  <p>  As part of the July 2020 Jobs Stimulus, the Government also introduced a series of initiatives focussed on workforce upskilling and the skilling or reskilling of new workforce entrants and those made redundant by the pandemic. These include:</p>  <p>  - 35,000 additional places in further and higher education</p>  <p>  - A Retrofit Skills Training Initiative, to support future expansion of the National Retrofitting Programme; and</p>  <p>  - An Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme, to support employers to take on new apprentices in 2020.

The breakdown per year is set out in the table below. </p><p>In terms of complaints submitted, many such complaints are withdrawn or settled prior to, or in the context of WRC hearings, and, in disposing of complaints, the WRC provides a pre-adjudication mediation service to assist parties resolve matters without the need for adjudication. </p><p>The onset of the Covid19 pandemic, in common with many adjudicative bodies, has had a significant impact on WRC service delivery. To address this the WRC in April 2020, carried out an extensive consultation with stakeholders to seek input on alternative approaches to complaint disposal. In this regard, the WRC proposed a service mix of written procedures, virtual hearings and, as circumstances allowed, in-person hearings. </p><p>In terms of the impact of Covid19 on scheduling, some 800 face-to-face adjudication case hearings scheduled to be heard in April and May were cancelled on foot of Covid-19 restriction announcements. A further 750 potential face-to-face hearings were lost during the months of June and July in line with appropriate restrictions on gatherings and travel. In total, over 2000 potential hearings were lost in 2020 which impacted directly on the number of decisions issued. </p><p>However, since S.I. 359/2020, which had the effect of removing the need for parties&rsquo; consent to virtual hearings came into force in September 2020, the WRC has been scheduling 100 virtual hearings a week on average, which is similar to the level of face-to-face hearings that pertained in 2019. The WRC has a target of scheduling 130 such hearings a week across 2021. This target is designed to return the WRC to pre-Covid-19 equilibrium in hearings terms by the end of the year and my Department has agreed support necessary to assist the WRC in this regard.</p><p><b>Adjudication Hearings by WRC Adjudication Service 2015-2020</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Adjudications Heard  </td>       <td>-</td>       <td>3518 </td>       <td>4370 </td>       <td>5312 </td>       <td>5009 </td>       <td>1899 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

An eligible employee is entitled to two weeks statutory redundancy payment for every year of service, plus a bonus week.  Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  </p>  <p>  The current situation is that the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 provides that a period of layoff within the final 3 years of service before redundancy is not allowable as reckonable service and is not included as service for the purposes of the calculation of the redundancy lump sum payment.  So, as it stands, an employee who is in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is on layoff from their employment and that period of layoff is not allowable as reckonable service.  Time spent on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme is not considered to be a lay-off period.</p>  <p>  The Department has sought legal advice on the matter.  It is legally complex for several reasons, and the Department is considering the full implications before any decision is made. The Department will continue to discuss with trade union and employer representatives.</p></reply>

The Agreement delivers on the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s objectives with businesses having access to zero rate preferential tariffs and quotas on goods traded between the EU and UK once the usual rules of origin for the EU-UK Free Trade Area are met.  This is vitally important for the agri-food sector, for example, which would otherwise have faced very significant additional costs and barriers when trading with the UK.  </p>  <p>  The Agreement should also preserve the flow of trade and services with the inclusion of critical elements on energy, public procurement and services.  It also contains welcome arrangements on road haulage, cross border bus services, rail, sea and air transport &ndash; all of which are vital for the easy movement of people, and delivery of goods and services.</p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department, in conjunction with Copenhagen Economics, undertook a comprehensive study to consider the impact of Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s trade and economy. The focus of the study was on the long term impact of four Brexit scenarios, including a &ldquo;Free Trade Agreement (FTA) scenario&rdquo; for GDP, national income, exports and imports. All results were to be compared to a 2030 baseline had Brexit not occurred. </p>  <p>  The FTA scenario used in the model reflected the average of all existing EU FTAs, rather than any single specific existing Agreement.  Furthermore, following agreement in October 2019 on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration for the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK, my Department commissioned further economic modelling to reflect the benefits of the terms of the Agreement and Political Declaration/Protocol on Northern Ireland.  This Analysis calculated that growth levels would be 3.2 to 3.9 per cent below where it would otherwise be, depending on whether a "best-case" or "worst-case" scenario was modelled. This effectively reduced by half the adverse impacts on the Irish economy that had been forecast for a trading relationship with the UK based on WTO terms, and the study identified a lessening of the negative impacts envisaged for the more generic FTA modelled in the previous Copenhagen Economics analysis. </p>  <p>  As regards undertaking a further impact assessment of the concluded EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), I believe it is too early to commence a meaningful economic and environmental impact assessment at this point as certain parts of the TCA and the Northern Ireland Protocol have grace periods or temporary derogations attached to them before they take full long-term effect.  For example, by 31 March 2021 the 3-month derogation from the requirement to provide export health certificates on food supplies from Great Britain to Northern Ireland ends.  On the other hand, a framework for regulatory cooperation in financial services between the EU and the UK is to be agreed by March 2021 and the EU is assessing the UK&rsquo;s data privacy regime before deciding whether to grant a data adequacy decision in favour of the UK.  Therefore, we will not have sufficient statistical data available to assess the totality of the impact of the TCA until such temporary derogations and all elements of the Agreement are fully in force, including any further easements or derogations that may be agreed under the TCA Joint Committee structures.  However, I am fully committed to such post-implementation evaluation at an appropriate point.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I should note that my Department and the Enterprise Agencies are in constant contact with industry bodies including through the Enterprise Forum and the Retail Forum to identify where sectoral and regional impacts of the TCA are emerging at an operational level.  We have a large number of Brexit supports including planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, the Enterprise Ireland Ready for Customs Grant of up to &euro;9,000, as well as financial supports for adapting and restructuring business models and grants for research into new markets to assist companies respond to the new TCA dispensation. In addition, Budget 2021 provided contingency funding for COVID-19 and for all Brexit outcomes and the Government is committed to assisting firms on a dynamic basis in responding to Brexit, especially those firms that are in the most severely impacted sectors. </p></reply>

Certainly, the more information that consumers have the better in terms of them being able to make buying decisions informed by the values that they consider important. We all know that price, quality, design and other considerations are factors in buying decisions but there is a growing and welcome focus on other factors such as the sustainability of the product and the impact that well informed consumer behaviour can have on the environment.</p>  <p>  As Minister with responsibility for consumer protection, my focus of course is on protecting consumers and ensuring that products are safe to use and that they have rights to refunds, replacements, etc., in certain situations. In this regard, the issue of displaying information about the origin of a product for consumer protection purposes is not simple as it involves an interplay between the Directive (EU) on Unfair Commercial Practice Directive (UCPD) and the EU Consumer Rights Directive (CRD). Traders who sell their goods online are required to provide particular information at the pre-contractual stage to consumers who may be considering whether or not to purchase a product from that trader. The information requirements are contained in Schedule 2 to S.I. No. 484/2013 - European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013. Schedule 2, paragraph (a) of the Regulation provides that prior to the conclusion of a distance contract, the trader will provide information in relation to the main characteristics of the goods or services, to the extent appropriate to the transaction medium and to the goods or services being purchased. What constitutes the main characteristics is set out in the European Commission&rsquo;s guidance note on the operation of the CRD. It makes the point that certain pre-contractual information requirements in the CRD are also found in the UCPD. </p>  <p>  The UCPD provides that the geographical origin of a product can be considered a main characteristic of the product and whilst the UCPD does not provide any formal requirement to indicate the geographical origin of a product, traders are prohibited from providing false or misleading information to consumers about this characteristic. However as the guidance refers, such information could be considered material as under Article 7 of the UCPD. If consumers consider the geographic origin of a product to be a material characteristic to their purchasing decision and if it is not obvious from the trader&rsquo;s website, they can enquire from the trader as to its origin. The trader is prohibited from providing false or misleading information in relation to that question. There is no relevant EU legislation requiring goods originating outside the single market to display a country of origin label other than foodstuffs which are listed in relevant EU legislation and are required to display information about their place of origin. </p>  <p>  The position with regard to .ie domain names is that where a website has a .ie domain name, this does not necessarily mean that the entity which owns and operates the website is based in Ireland.  ComReg appointed We Are Ireland Online.ie as the relevant authority to register domain names in accordance with Section 32. (4)(a) of the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007. In order to register a .ie domain name, traders must apply to We Are Ireland Online.ie through their online application process. As part of their registration requirements, applicants must have a connection to Ireland and be able to provide documentation to prove that connection.  Therefore, websites with a .ie registration may not necessarily prove that the trader is based in Ireland. </p>  <p>  A new initiative by the European Commission will impact on the area of sustainable consumption in the future. In November 2020 the European Commission launched their New Consumer Agenda which presents a vision for EU consumer policy from 2020 to 2025.  The agenda complements other Commission initiatives such as the Green Deal and the Circular Economy Action Plan.  The Agenda puts forward priorities and key action points to be taken in the next 5 years together with Member States at European and national levels. This will, among other things, include a new legal proposal aimed at providing better information on sustainability to consumers and envisages that businesses, including SMEs, could play an important role in this transformation.  The Commission plans to put forward a legislative initiative in 2021 on sustainable corporate governance to foster long-term sustainable and responsible corporate behaviour. Ireland supports this agenda and will play an active part in its development including the provision of better information to consumers and supporting cross EU standards in this regard.</p>  <p>  I think a powerful motivator for progress in this space is increasing consumer awareness and changing consumer behaviour. It makes good business sense for retailers to respond to changing preferences in customer demand and to offer goods and services which meet such demands. It is therefore important that everyone involved, be they Government, non-governmental organisations, educators and advocates continue to raise awareness of the issue so that everyone takes into account environmental considerations when purchasing including ethical sourcing. Businesses may need assistance in meeting consumers expectations.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that COVID-19 has brought considerable challenges for retailers - large and small, across the country.  Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business offerings in the current crisis and it will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term. My Department proposed the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in their online capability. The Scheme is administered by Enterprise Ireland. Applicant companies must be indigenous retailers, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g., website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme.</p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). CRU was assigned this responsibility following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. It has a wide range of customer protection functions under the above framework which are implemented via the various Codes of Practice set out in CRU&rsquo;s Supplier Handbook.</p>  <p>  As part of its statutory role, the CRU monitors energy retail markets to ensure that competition continues to develop. It also oversees non-price aspects of competition, and continues to take steps to increase transparency and consumer engagement in retail markets. Measures introduced by the CRU include a stipulation that electricity suppliers provide customers with an Estimated Annual Bill, highlighting the yearly average electricity bill for a particular electricity supplier rather than just the discounted offers. Additionally, suppliers must issue a written notification on an annual basis to prompt consumers who have been on the same tariff or on a non-discounted tariff for more than 3 years to consider switching. </p>  <p>  CRU has a statutory role to ensure that suppliers provide customer charters to customers prior to making any contractual commitment. These customer charters set out the minimum stipulations regarding a customer&rsquo;s right to a contract with a supplier, including the duration of the contract and conditions for renewable and termination.  </p>  <p>  The ERA states that the CRU shall account for the performance of its functions to a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas and not to me as Minister. Given this CRU statutory accountability to an Oireachtas Committee, the Deputy may wish to note that CRU provide a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions directly to CRU, including on its customer protection functions, at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

The Centre also provides expert advice and analysis on cyber security issues and is involved in coordinating the response to significant incidents. The NCSC is composed of highly skilled, specialist technical civilian staff, with skillsets in areas such as computer science, software engineering, malware analysis, information technology forensics, cryptography, software development, and cyber security compliance, as well as general cyber security skills. In 2020 two additional cyber security experts were recruited by my Department to work in the NCSC and following a further recruitment competition a Chief Technology Officer will be appointed to the NCSC shortly.    </p>  <p>  The 2019 National Cyber Security Strategy set out a series of measures to further improve and develop the capacity of the NCSC. In order to assess the capacity of the NCSC to deliver its objectives as set out in the strategy, an external review of the NCSC has been commissioned. The capacity review, which commenced in January 2021, will examine the current organisational structure, staffing, work processes and financing of the NCSC and will benchmark it against international best practice models. Work in relation to the capacity review is on-going and the report of the independent experts is expected early in Q2. The findings of the review will then be considered and will inform decisions to be taken on the future resourcing of the NCSC.</p></reply>

It is also estimated that over the period 2020 to 2050, 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions will be avoided. </p>  <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has been established as Scheme Regulator to ensure the effective oversight of the rehabilitation and restoration works. Bord an M&oacute;na must submit a plan for each bog to both the National Parks and Wildlife Services in respect of this scheme, and to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in respect of works required to meet their Integrated Pollution Control licence obligations. As part of this process, Bord Na M&oacute;na is consulting with stakeholders and landowners that may be impacted by the scheme. Bord na M&oacute;na carry out such consultation in accordance with EPA guidance on the process of preparing and implementing bog rehabilitation plans, which focuses on meaningful, early, on-going and transparent consultation with all national and local regulators, local interest/community groups, and affected parties.</p>  <p>  Covid restrictions have impacted Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s capacity to call door-to-door to affected parties and, as such, newspaper advertisements have been issued in local publications. In addition, Bord na M&oacute;na have recently launched a digital information hub for the Scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. To qualify for the scheme recipients must be in receipt of a qualifying welfare payments from the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  Currently, there are over 7,800 homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.</p>  <p>  SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months, which would have included an impact of COVID-19 restrictions.  For the same time period, the average time for a surveyor to be allocated was approximately 8 months.</p>  <p>  SEAI have advised my Department that the average waiting times quoted above should only ever be used as a general guide and waiting times may vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application.  For instance, once the survey is completed and works are allocated to a contractor the time to complete works is dependent on a number of factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials, weather and more recently COVID-19 public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. This funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades, making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced at the end of 2020. I also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to allow it drive the various grant programmes that it operates, including the Warmer Homes Scheme, and to ensure that level of activity envisaged under the Programme for Government is delivered. My Department is also in regular contact with the SEAI at official level in relation to the operation of the Scheme. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will also be finalised shortly.</p></reply>

These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the eir exchanges or the metropolitan area networks (MANs) managed by Enet. It is based on an engineering design that allows NBI to get to every premises as quickly as possible  working within the confines of how fibre networks are built. Each DA creates a &lsquo;fibre ring&rsquo; which is essential to ensure reliability, robustness and resilience. Critical to the success of the network, NBI&rsquo;s fibre rings are built with back-ups, ensuring that in the event of one fibre cable being disrupted, the whole network continues to perform. Each fibre ring that NBI deploys is designed in a way that is non-discriminatory meaning that as the rollout progresses, it may pass relatively urban areas at the same time as passing some of the most remote premises within the intervention area. The design will utilise existing infrastructure to a very significant degree.</p>  <p>  The deployment plan forecasts construction commenced in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p>  <p>  The NBI website provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p></reply>

I am advised by NBI that, as of 15 February 2021, over 178,000 premises across 26 counties have been surveyed. The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected and in a test and trial phase in Carrigaline, Co Cork and Cavan. Technical testing and validation will be undertaken prior to a wider release of the areas. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 15 February 2021, 274 sites have been installed by NBI. In addition, school BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband for educational use through this initiative. An acceleration of this aspect of the project was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.</p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally), as well as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up, including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. </p></reply>

Emissions from the residential and commercial/institutional sectors were the main contributors with a 55% share, followed by the transport sector at 14%. Heavy Duty Vehicles were responsible for 1.4% of total PM2.5 emissions, with rail contributing 0.4%.</p><p>Measures to address all air pollutants are set out in the National Air Pollution Control Programme (NAPCP), which includes the key policies supported and implemented in Ireland that have aimed to reduce emissions from road transport. </p><p>The NAPCP details the measures that have been taken to control overall transport emissions, reduce congestion, promote fuel efficiency, and in doing so support health and well-being. An update to this programme is currently being finalised and will be published in the coming weeks. </p><p>The EPA is responsible for monitoring ambient air quality in Ireland via the national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme. All monitoring stations collect air quality data for a range of pollutants in order to provide information to the public, and for assessment against European legal limit values and World Health Organisation guideline values. Real-time data from these monitoring stations is available online at all times at www.airquality.ie.</p><p>Particulate matter, from the burning of solid fuel, is estimated to cause 1,300 premature deaths per year in Ireland, and Government is committed to addressing this public health and environmental challenge thorough a nationwide ban on smoky coal and enhanced regulation of other solid fuels. </p><p>I have taken an important step in this process by launching a public consultation which is seeking views in relation to the national application of the regulations currently applied to bituminous coal, as well as informing the development of appropriate regulatory controls for other residential solid fuels. This is an opportunity for all parties - consumers, retailers, producers and industry - to consider the issues, input to the process at the earliest stage, and to consider alternatives as appropriate, as we take the actions required to achieve our ambition of cleaner air across all of Ireland.</p></reply>

I understand the cash flow pressure that they are under, the unique implications of the refund requirements placed by the Package Travel Directive and the difficulties they have had with the airlines in securing refunds.</p>  <p>  As a largely SME sector,  travels agents and tour operators have access to the various business supports made available in last year's July stimulus package and in Budget 2021, which contains historic levels of State support in the form of wage supplements, financial grants and waived commercial rates.  </p>  <p>  The State is also providing a special financial guarantee under a Refund Credit Note scheme for the sector, which makes the credit notes that licensed travel agent and tour operators issue to their customers a very secure proposition.  Credits notes to the value of &euro;19 million have already been issued to consumers under the scheme &ndash; under which their value is guaranteed by the State - and this is money that the industry would otherwise have had to pay back in cash refunds.  I know this does not come close to replacing lost business, but it is significant nonetheless.</p>  <p>  It has been brought to my attention that some travel agents and tour operators have been experiencing difficulties accessing the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), whereby some in the sector have qualified for CRSS because they have physical shop fronts, whilst others have not, typically because they operate wholly through online channels.  The Government has responded with the announcement of the new Covid-19 Business Aid Scheme, which will narrow the number of businesses that are not receiving some form of fixed cost support payment, but sadly cannot help everyone.</p>  <p>  The Government has been particularly focused on dealing with the public health challenges arising from the behaviour of the virus since late December, but our attention is also on the impact on businesses and on people&rsquo;s lives too.   Given the depth of the impact of COVID, the Government approach to date is to focus on supports that cover as many sectors and businesses as possible.  Over the coming months or so, I expect that more focus will be brought to how we continue to support jobs and businesses in the event that restrictions &ndash; including on international travel &ndash; will remain in place longer than any of us want them to.  In that context, Minister Ryan and I recently met with the Irish Travel Agents Association, where the sector made the case for continued financial support.  The proposals made by the ITAA are being examined.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to doing everything possible to support all those affected by this terrible virus, including continuing to help businesses survive until such times as they can being to trade again.</p></reply>

I have therefore referred this part of the Question to the Authority for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.   </p>  <p>  The Driver Theory Test (DTT) has not been classified as an essential service by Government and consequently it has had to be suspended in light of Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions. All Driver Theory Tests  will remain suspended for the duration of level 5 restrictions. The Driver Theory Test will not be conducted for essential workers while we remain in level 5. </p>  <p>  While I fully appreciate the inconvenience this poses to learners, I am sure you will agree with me that the limiting of the spread of the virus and the safeguarding of public health must take first priority here.  </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to maximise capacity to offer tests while adhering to occupational and public health requirements for when services are resumed. In this regard, they would, for example, be opening on additional days at some centres and extended hours also provided to allow additional capacity for appointments.</p>  <p>  While this is an operational matter for the Authority, I understand the Driver Theory Test service has recently launched a pilot phase of a new initiative, which offers a Remote Testing service for specific categories of Theory Test (C, D, CD, BMT, TMT, ADI, CPCB, CPCT). Following a review of the pilot phase, I understand the RSA expect the initiative to be extended for car and motorcycles.  </p>  <p>  The RSA are keen to progress and extend the service to all categories of Driver Theory Test, however scaling up operations to facilitate higher numbers will take time to achieve.   </p></reply>

As many of the suggestions raised are operational matters, I have also referred the question to the Authority for direct reply.  If a reply has not been received within 10 working days, the Deputy should contact my office. </p>  <p>  The Department has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time for the Driver Testing Service. It is clear that it will not be possible to arrive at this quickly, given restraints which must be in place due to the pandemic.  It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to reach a normal waiting time.  </p>  <p>  I am happy to comment on the matters raised, where it is appropriate to do so.  </p>  <p>  1. Stop all &ldquo;check tests  </p>  <p>  Under provisions set out in S.I. No. 203/2009 - Road Traffic (Driving Instructor Licensing) (No. 2) Regulations 2009 the Road Safety Authority (RSA) is legally required to carry out a check test of an Approved Driving Instructor every two years at the very minimum. This test takes the form of an observation by an RSA examiner of a lesson given by the instructor to a learner driver and is considered an essential element in the regulation and continuous professional development of driving instructors. </p>  <p>  Driving is a complex and multi-faceted skill and instructors shoulder a considerable responsibility in teaching their students to behave safely and responsibly on the roads at all times. It is for this reason that it is imperative that the RSA have a means of ensuring that all instructors maintain the highest of teaching standards in the years after they have completed their initial qualification.   It is important that we do not allow the current pandemic to unnecessarily undermine the very significant progress we have made in reducing the impact of road collisions on public health and health services. </p>  <p>  I further understand that the RSA, since resuming check tests in September, has drawn upon a provision in the 2009 regulation permitting the conducting of a test with the examiner playing the role of the learner driver rather than the learner driver themselves. This provision will serve to limit the number of people present in the vehicle for the duration of the check test from three to two and thus reduce the public health risk accordingly.</p>  <p>  4. ADIs to use the facilities at test centres. </p>  <p>  Operational arrangements at test centres, including the availability of waiting and washing facilities, are a matter for the Road Safety Authority. I understand that the Authority decided to temporarily close public toilet and waiting facilities in the interests of public safety and as part of its overall Covid-19 resumption of service protocols and in line with health and safety risk assessment procedures which had to be adopted as part of the RSA's resumption plans. It took account of guidance issued by the Health and Safety Authority and the return to work safely protocol agreed by the Labour and Employer Economic Forum, LEEF. </p>  <p>  In response to a formal request from Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton to review these arrangements, the Authority wrote to the Department in November outlining the absolute necessity of retaining these safety measures. While the Authority recognises that this may be inconvenient for partners, family members and indeed driving instructors who accompany learner drivers to their tests, the fact remains that the more people who enter a building, the greater the risk of Covid spreading. The safety of staff and the public in general must remain the Road Safety Authority's number one priority at this time.</p>  <p>  6. Increase the number of testers</p>  <p>  Following from discussions with the RSA, my Department has approved the hiring of a further 40 temporary testers for 22 months, and the process of recruitment is now underway. However it will take some time for people to be selected and trained. These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers who were re-hired over the course of 2020, whose contracts expired during last year.</p>  <p>  These measures will help to increase testing capacity. However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are operational matters for the RSA and have been referred to the RSA for direct reply.  </p></reply>

Under the Harbours Acts 1996 to 2015, the ports are the pilotage authorities for their respective pilotage districts and it is a matter for individual ports to decide what is appropriate in terms of training and procedures for marine pilots within their respective areas of authority.  Pilots or licensed contractors who provide pilotage services are required to meet these standards.  For those reasons the Department of Transport does not set standards for the training or licensing of marine pilots and on that basis, I do not plan to introduce any changes to the Harbours Acts regarding standardisation of marine pilotage.</p>  <p>Regarding the recommendations on training and certification set out in IMO Resolution A.960 in relation to marine pilotage, the Marine Survey Office has advised that these are recommendations and are not binding.  As already indicated, it is a matter for ports to determine appropriate training standards for pilots within their respective areas of authority.   </p></reply>

However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law.</p>  <p>  Mindful of the position that Government has taken in relation to international travel in the interests of public health,  the issue of consumer rights has been high on my agenda since taking Office.  I have raised this with the airlines, and at the height of the uncertainty last Summer, in particular, I engaged with both Aer Lingus and Ryanair to underscore that options offered to consumers should be fair and reasonable.</p>  <p>  As it now seems likely that Summer 2021 is also going to be adversely affected from a travel and holiday perspective, I will again be raising the importance of there being fairness and reasonableness in dealing with consumers, in addition to the need to comply fully with consumer rights as covered in EU law.  If any individuals are unclear about those rights, the Commission for Aviation Regulation has a dedicated web site for consumers, www.flightrights.ie.</p></reply>

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across the system to enable the continued operation of services safely during the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.</p>  <p>  The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector, including temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector, in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation.  </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services  and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services. Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance and as such I have had no engagement with the Minister of Health on this issue.  I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

A Covid-19 testing service for drivers was required to be in operation by 27 January. Given the extreme urgency involved, my Department issued a request for quotes to a number of suppliers and entered into a contract with one supplier, to provide antigen testing services. The service involves the provision of antigen testing for commercial drivers at a number of sites located close to our ports with direct maritime services from Ireland to France. This arrangement is in place for a temporary period. </p>  <p>  Given the extreme urgency involved, my Department relied on the negotiated procedure without prior publication, as set out in the derogation at Regulation 32(2)(c) of the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations S.I 284/2016 for this procurement.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to run a full tendering process to provide COVID-19 testing services for commercial drivers in the event that the French requirements for a negative test prior to embarkment remain beyond this initial period or further countries introduce such a requirement.

This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>The project is due to be completed in 2022.  </p><p>Further details on ESB charge points nationwide can be found at .</p><p>In light of the ESB eCars responsibility in the matter of the number of charge points provided by county, I have forwarded the Deputies' questions to the ESB for direct response.  Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days. </p><p>While several private operators such as Tesla, Ionity &amp;amp; EasyGO are involved in providing charging infrastructure, my Department does not hold information on the location of charging infrastructure which has been installed without government support.  I am aware, however, that ESB has partnered with Tesco Ireland to install 22kW Standard AC Chargers at 33 Tesco locations around the country in the last number of months. More than 50 of these are planned in total. My Department is also making &euro;2 million available next year through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and shopping centres. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p><p>In addition to the ESB project, my Department also provides support through the SEAI Public Charge Point Scheme which has been in place since September 2019 to provide funding to local authorities for the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate those EV owners who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles on public streets, by enabling them to charge their EVs near their homes.  A total of 75% of the capital costs is provided through a grant, up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per charge point.  My Department will continue to support this scheme through the grants provided by SEAI and in parallel is also developing a charging infrastructure strategy, in line with the Programme for Government, which will ensure capacity keeps ahead of demand. </p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the SEAI, on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.</p></reply>

The supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiver of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme.</p>  <p>  As regards supports specifically targeted at the protection of employment, the Employment Wage Subsidy Schemes (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government's response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment amid these very challenging times. The EWSS higher subsidy rate will apply until 31 March 2021. The scheme will continue during 2021 and the Government will decide on the form of its extension when economic conditions are clearer, guided by what the economy requires at that time to support the expected economic recovery.</p>  <p>  In November, the Government also agreed a revised &euro;80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the sector. My Department is currently engaging with the European Commission regarding formal approval of this package which will be implemented in line with EU State aid rules.</p>  <p>  Any additional supports designed to facilitate growth of air traffic can only be progressed at the appropriate time, taking account of the outlook for the easing of travel restrictions and improving wider epidemiological conditions.</p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Irish aviation sector on an ongoing basis in consultation with relevant Government Ministers, including the Minister for Tourism and the Minister for Enterprise Trade &amp;amp; Employment in relation to Tourism and FDI impacts.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector.</p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. To this end, my Department has convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The EVPP Working Group has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales. Furthermore, the Government, supported by the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, has worked to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base. There are currently around 28,000 EVs under taxation in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Programme for Government commitments, my Department is expanding the scope of vehicle types to include personal electrified modes of transport. For example, legislation is being drafted to enable the legal use of electric scooters. Subject to resolution of outstanding issues relating to road safety and the movement of traffic, I intend to bring forward amendments to the relevant primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill comes before the Oireachtas in the next few months. Accordingly, I am confident that we are making real progress towards the delivery of our ambition for the transition to an electrified and low-carbon transport system.</p>  <p>  With regards to public transport, moves are already afoot to electrify the bus and rail networks. To date, a total of 280 diesel-electric hybrid buses have been ordered, of which 100 should be operational by mid-2021, with the remainder to be delivered before year end. The National Transport Authority (NTA) are also tendering for both single- and double-deck full electric town buses, with the first vehicles expected to arrive towards the end of next year. My Department is also funding electric vehicle pilot projects in rural areas under the Local Link programme.</p>  <p>  In terms of heavy rail, this year we are looking to expand electrification through the DART+ programme which will ultimately mean around 70% of journeys in any given year on the rail network will be on electrified services. In addition, we are expanding capacity on the Luas Green Line and will look at route options for Luas Cork, Luas Lucan and the preliminary design for Luas Finglas in the coming months. Also, work is underway to progress MetroLink which will provide a fully electrified metro service in Dublin. Finally, building on the eSPSV grant scheme that was in place for the last 2 years, I have introduced an EV scrappage scheme to support taxi and hackney drivers switching from older vehicles to EVs.</p></reply>

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore, they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.</p>  <p>  The intention is to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government this year. This involves identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work is being carried out in such a way so that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic law or road safety in general. Department officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation. Subject to satisfactory resolution of the necessary issues, I intend to bring forward committee stage amendments to the enabling primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is before the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The current approach taken by my Department to permit the safe use of e-scooters on public roads takes into consideration the rapid development of these vehicles used for personal transportation. In order to future-proof the legislation and account for the development of these new vehicles, the road traffic acts are being amended to introduce a new category of vehicle - the proposed title for this new category is "powered personal transporters". This will be the first time the categories of vehicles set out in the Road Traffic Act 1961 have been amended.</p>  <p>  Once the new category has been defined, these vehicles are to be incorporated into the existing legislative framework (wherein a range of powers/offences already exist) and this will permit the Minister for Transport to regulate for the use/misuse and the standards for different types of powered personal transporters, for example, through the introduction of regulations for e-scooters. Furthermore, the existing offences and powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in road traffic legislation concerning careless/dangerous driving, driving under the influence of an intoxicant, driving an unroadworthy vehicle. etc. can also then be extended to users of powered personal transporters where required.</p>  <p>  The introduction of shared/rental schemes, such as those currently in operation for cars, bicycles and electric bicycles will be a matter for consideration at a later date as the legislation progresses within the overall framework of sustainable mobility policy. Until the new legislation is in place, the use of e-scooters on public roads or in public places will remain illegal.</p></reply>

No. 203/2009 - Road Traffic (Driving Instructor Licensing) (No. 2) Regulations 2009 the Road Safety Authority (RSA) is legally required to carry out a check test of an Approved Driving Instructor every two years at the very minimum. This test takes the form of an observation by an RSA examiner of a lesson given by the instructor to a learner driver and is considered an essential element in the regulation and continuous professional development of driving instructors.</p>  <p>  Driving is a complex and multi-faceted skill and instructors shoulder a considerable responsibility in teaching their students to behave safely and responsibly on the roads at all times. It is for this reason that it is imperative that the RSA have a means of ensuring that all instructors maintain the highest of teaching standards in the years after they have completed their initial qualification. It is important that we do not allow the current pandemic to unnecessarily undermine the very significant progress we have made in reducing the impact of road collisions on public health and health services.</p>  <p>   I further understand that the RSA, since resuming check tests in September, has drawn upon a provision in the 2009 regulation permitting the conducting of a test with the examiner playing the role of the learner driver rather than the learner driver themselves. This provision will serve to limit the number of people present in the vehicle for the duration of the check test from three to two and thus reduce the  risk of transmission accordingly.</p></reply>

Upon passing the theory test, an individual can then apply for a learner permit.</p>  <p>  Until a person has successfully completed their driver theory test and thereby demonstrated they have attained a sufficient level of road safety and motoring knowledge, they cannot commence driving on our roads. Allowing individuals to bypass this vital step in the learning to drive process will only put their and others&rsquo; safety at risk &ndash; and risk further pressure on our health services.</p>  <p>  While the Driver Theory Test (DTT) remains closed during Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions, the Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to maximise capacity to offer tests for when services are resumed. In this regard, they would, for example, be opening on additional days at some centres and extended hours would also be provided to allow additional capacity for appointments.</p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance. My officials and I are working hard to ensure the resumption of services as soon as Level 5 is lifted.</p></reply>

The response from shipping operators has been comprehensive and has occurred across all relevant modes and has drawn from all available responses. These responses include (1) utilization of surplus capacity, (2) increasing capacity by altering schedules, (3) redeploying vessels within their fleets, and (4) adding new capacity in the form of additional vessels.</p>  <p>  This increase in demand and response is evidenced by the fact that this month to date, there are around 68 RoRo freight sailings in a typical week. This includes all five shipping operators and both accompanied and unaccompanied freight. This represents an increase of around 42 sailings per week compared to February 2020.</p>  <p>  The new direct services and routes have given Irish importers and exporters additional choice and a range of effective and efficient options to avoid any current disruption being experienced on the UK landbridge. The market remains dynamic but has demonstrated it is willing and able to respond to the changing needs of business and I would expect that it will continue to do so as the market settles.</p>  <p>  In terms of aviation, the EU-UK Trade Agreement provides for the continuation of air access for passenger and air freight services between Ireland and UK and no significant Brexit related issues have been reported in this sector.  Approximately 60% of all air cargo travels in the hold of passenger aircraft operating regular scheduled air services, with the remainder travelling with dedicated air cargo operators or smaller air operators. With so many passenger services suspended, I am aware that demand for air cargo capacity has increased which has increased the price per kilo of air cargo by several factors. Despite this, key air routes ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity for essential reasons, including import and export, continue to operate.</p></reply>

Then there is the ongoing construction of the National Train Control Centre which will improve and expand the capacity of the train management system used across our rail network and underpin the service expansion planned under DART+, which will double the capacity of the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) commuter rail network and greatly benefit Kildare commuters along both the Maynooth and Kildare Lines. Finally there is of course also the expansion of the existing GDA commuter rail fleet through the addition of 41 additional rail carriages which will also benefit commuters in the Kildare commuter belt and which are scheduled to arrive next year. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these hugely significant improvements planned or underway the Deputy is right to highlight the need to plan for the future. As the Deputy is aware Kildare forms part of the statutorily defined GDA in the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and its transport needs are therefore considered as part of the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 to 2035. The Strategy is currently under review as is required every six years and in reviewing it the NTA must have regard to a number of issues as set out in the Act including &lsquo;demographic, economic, social, travel and transport trends&rsquo;. I would encourage all citizens and public representatives in the Kildare area to contribute to this important review.   </p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport. </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the provision of public transport services and for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), which comprises 7 local authority areas, including Kildare.</p>  <p>  The DART+ Programme is a multi-billion euro programme to upgrade rail services in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  DART+ will provide frequent, modern, electrified services to Drogheda on the Northern Commuter Line, the Kildare Line (between Hazelhatch and Celbridge), Maynooth and M3 Parkway on the Maynooth / Sligo Line, while improving DART services on the South-East Line as far south as Greystones.  The DART+ Programme includes both the upgrade of the railway infrastructure and the purchase of new fleet and will effectively double the capacity of the existing network and DART level services.</p>  <p>  DART+ West, Maynooth/M3 Line, is the first element of the DART+ Programme to be progressed.  It will significantly increase the number of trains operating on the Maynooth/M3 Parkway rail corridor and upon completion will allow for a potential doubling of the services per hour, tripling passenger capacity. A first round of non-statutory public consultations for DART+ West concluded last October. Consideration of submissions made is underway and further design development and assessment of options is being undertaken.  The next round of consultation is expected to take place this Quarter. </p>  <p>  DART+ South West - the current Kildare Line - is the next element. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are currently progressing the options selection process and it is anticipated that a public consultation on the emerging preferred route will be undertaken also in Q1 2021.  This will provide an opportunity for all members of the public to comment on the emerging preferred route.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Deputy will also be aware of Government's approval last year of the proposed purchase of 41 additional carriages to the inter-city railcar (ICR) fleet. The carriages are expected to be delivered through 2022 and, when introduced, will increase capacity across both the Maynooth and Kildare Lines, thus benefitting commuters of North Kildare in advance of the delivery of DART+.  </p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in the area, I have also forwarded the Deputies questions to the Authority for further information on the issues raised.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

In this context the Department held a public consultation process between November 2019 and February 2020, and included a stakeholder event in the course of that consultation.  Over 250 submissions were received as part of this public consultation process and I published a report of the public consultation. </p>  <p>  I intend to develop a new policy framework for the next 10 years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme.  The new policy statement will be informed by the review of the previous policy framework (known as Smarter Travel), submissions received during my Department's consultation process and the views and recommendations of other relevant stakeholders.  It will provide a platform to advance the ambitions of the Programme for Government in the area of sustainable mobility, including active travel, and will replace the previous Smarter Travel policy, dating from 2009.  </p>  <p>  Our Programme for Government commitments in relation to public transport in rural areas will be progressed in the context of that new policy statement. Among the measures we will prioritise is a Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system, expanding the Local Link rural transport service and prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity. </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.  The NTA also has responsibility for local and rural transport, including the management of Local Link services.</p>  <p>  The NTA has undertaken a nationwide study to inform its approach to rolling out improved public transport across the country (excluding the GDA, Regional Cities and Large Towns) by providing better connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide.</p>  <p>  Arising from this study, I am advised that the NTA is undertaking a two-phase consultation on its proposals, titled 'Connecting Ireland'; which began with local authority officials and other key stakeholders on the main concepts of Connecting Ireland, and will be followed by a wider public consultation in Q2 2021 on the proposals.</p>  <p>  I have referred the Deputy's specific question in relation to improvements to rural transport in County Kildare to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you have not received a reply within ten days.</p></reply>

I understand that the Preliminary Business Case will be finalised well in advance of the completion of the review of the National Development Plan and therefore the funding requirements for the project will usefully inform my engagement with that process in due course. </p>  <p>  In relation to COVID-19 related delays, there have been some delays associated with the cessation of construction activity at certain times and the impact that has had on surveying works for example; however, overall those particular delays have not been particularly significant given the very early stage of the project. </p>  <p>  I firmly believe that high-quality public transport will still be necessary as we recover from the longer term effects of the pandemic, notwithstanding the changes it may bring about to certain aspects of our behaviour, such as the traditional commute. Obviously, issues in relation to potentially changed commuting demand will need to be reflected in the development of Preliminary Business Cases for transport projects in the future but I would note that the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s National Travel Survey shows us that commuting accounts for less than 25% of all trips.  Projects that can enable high-density residential development, support localised travel, and provide connectivity to citizens wishing to undertake a wide range of daily activities will continue to have a place in our investment programme in my opinion.</p></reply>

Under the Regulation, if an airline cancels a flight then customers are entitled to a full cash refund within 7 days.</p>  <p>  Mindful of the position that Government has taken in relation to international travel in the interests of public health, the issue of consumer rights has been high on my agenda since taking Office.  I have raised the matter of customer refunds with our main airlines over the past number of months, and it is understood that the backlogs have been prioritised and that most refunds have now been processed.  As it now seems likely that Summer 2021 is also going to be adversely affected from a travel and holiday perspective, the Deputy can be assured that the same message around the need to comply fully with consumer rights as covered in EU law will be conveyed again.</p>  <p>  I would encourage anyone who having already corresponded with the airline continues to have difficulties securing a refund contact the Commission for Aviation Regulation. Further advice, is available on its dedicated passenger rights website www.flightrights.ie.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day workings of the office or in the decisions which he takes.</p>  <p>  I am advised that where a complaint is made to the FSPO concerning a joint account or a joint policy, the FSPO must recognise that all parties to the account or policy have rights, entitlements and potential liabilities arising in relation to such an account or policy, and accordingly certain data protection issues arise. Whether the complaint is settled by way of agreement between the parties, using the confidential Dispute Resolution Services of the FSPO, or is the subject of a formal investigation by the FSPO, leading to a legally binding decision, the rights and obligations of all joint account holders or joint policyholders are thereby affected. All owners of the account or policy must therefore be agreeable to the investigation of the complaint by the FSPO, and their signature provides evidence of their agreement.</p>  <p>  If a complainant indicates a difficulty in securing the signature of another party to an account or policy, the FSPO reviews the individual circumstances to form an understanding as to the reason for the difficulty, and where possible offers guidance as appropriate, as to what options may be available.

HTB was initially announced on 19 July 2016 as part of the &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rsquo;. </p><p>An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis. One of the main aims of the policy underpinning the design of HTB was to help encourage the building of additional new properties. By restricting the scheme solely to new dwellings and new self-builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes will encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. In accordance with a commitment in the Programme for Government, HTB was enhanced in July 2020.  It is too soon to draw conclusions as to the impact of the enhancements on supply. </p><p>HTB has been the subject of two independent reviews: an impact assessment (2017), and a full Cost Benefit Analysis (2018), both carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. </p><p>The report of the impact assessment was published as part of Budget 2018 documents and is available at the following link:</p><p> </p><p>The report of the Cost Benefit Analysis was published on the day of Budget 2019, in the Department of Finance Report on Tax Expenditures, and is available at the following link: </p><p>www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2019/Documents/Tax%20Expenditures%20Report%20Budget%202019.pdf .</p><p>In brief, the 2018 CBA, confirmed the findings of the independent review as follows:</p><p><b>- Prices: </b>While there might have been a very small increase in prices attributable to the introduction of the incentive, the primary driver of house prices remained the continued misalignment between demand and supply.</p><p><b>- Supply: </b>The evidence suggested that following the introduction of the incentive there was a marked increase in supply which can be attributed in part to HTB.</p><p><b>- Affordability: </b>The analysis also found that availability of HTB had reduced the time to save for all claimants and improved the overall affordability of housing for these individuals.</p><p><b>- Benefit/Cost Ratio:</b>The analysis found a benefit-cost ratio of 1.28 indicating a moderate positive effect for the incentive.</p><p>Finally, in relation to impacts on house prices, to the extent that data are available at this point, Revenue advise me that for 2020 the average purchase price relating to HTB claims to December 31 2020 was &euro;329,000 which was the same as the figure for 2019.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p><p>Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: </p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. A self-employed travel agent providing services from a home office, which is not customer-facing, will not meet the eligibility criteria.  Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS. </p><p>Deputies will be aware of the Tourism Business Continuity scheme, a &euro;55m strategic funding scheme announced as part of Budget 2021 to support tourism businesses which was launched recently. I understand that boat tour companies and also angling/fishing charters are eligible for phase 1 of this scheme. Further details of the scheme are available on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website at  </p><p>Deputies will also be aware that my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently announced &euro;160m funding for measures to help businesses during the pandemic which may be of assistance to your constituents. One of these new schemes, the COVID-19 Business Aid Scheme (CBAS) is being developed to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the government&rsquo;s other existing schemes designed to help with fixed costs.  Further details are available at .</p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises. </p><p>I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS or to introduce sectoral supports. The CRSS is just one of the Government&rsquo;s supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may be entitled to alternative supports put in place by the Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme mentioned above. Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020.  </p><p>I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.</p></reply>

I'm precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p>  <p>  The application of interest rate charges is solely a commercial matter for the board and management of each bank. </p>  <p>  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the Covid19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in large part it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs it is important to note that banks cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason the approach taken is to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.</p></reply>

It is also important to note that PUP recipients will only pay tax when they return to work.</p>  <p>  When a recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately cease the PUP claim with the Department of Social Protection (DSP). DSP will then notify Revenue that the payment has ceased, and Revenue will adjust the employee&rsquo;s tax credits accordingly. For a person who is on the PUP at the start of the year, the weekly amount is annualised on the Tax Credit Certificate (TCC), with automatic knock on impacts on the tax credits and standard rate cut off point. This &lsquo;annualisation&rsquo; operates as if the person is to remain on the PUP for the full year. When the person comes off PUP the TCC is amended to reflect the fact that the payment has ceased.</p>  <p>  A revised instruction (Revenue Payroll Notification) then issues to the relevant employer to reflect the updated position and the revised TCC issues to the employee via the online myAccount service.  Any delay in issuing the revised instruction to the employer will delay the employee receiving his or her full tax credit entitlements so prompt notification by the employee to the DSP is very important.</p>  <p>  The employee should also confirm with his or her employer that deductions of tax are being made based on the most up to date Revenue Payroll Notification issued to the employer by Revenue. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, where a self-employed individual incurs a loss for a year of assessment, a provision is available that allows the individual to elect to have that loss offset sideways against other income of the individual, or in cases of joint assessment, against income of the individual&rsquo;s spouse/civil partner. Therefore, where an individual has incurred a loss in 2020, they may utilise this loss to shelter a tax liability arising from receipt of the PUP. </p>  <p>Finally, Revenue has confirmed to me that there is no delay between receipt of DSP notifications of PUP cessations and the subsequent adjustment of the relevant employees&rsquo; tax credits, which operates through an electronic data transfer. However, if any persons are concerned that they are overpaying tax on PUP payments they should contact Revenue&rsquo;s National PAYE Helpline at 01-7383636.    </p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions apply.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance and what terms to apply. These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle. In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration. In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the mortgage repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.</p>  <p>  My officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for such providers on this issue recently. It stated that it is aware of a cases where a final decision on applications is being deferred in instances where applicants have displayed symptoms of COVID-19, been referred for, or undergoing COVID-19 testing, or had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. It also stated that it is normal practice to defer a decision on any condition in these cases. However, it also stated that is unlikely that once the applicant has fully recovered from an illness that it would have any impact on the policy they are seeking to take out, although this does depend on the individual case and the severity of the impact of the infection. Insurance Ireland further noted that it understands that mortgage protection is not a universal requirement by banks, and that there are waiver conditions set out in the Consumer Credit Act where the lender may be able to proceed without the protection cover in place for mortgages in certain situations and this is at the lender&rsquo;s discretion.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Deputy will be aware that both I and Minister of State Fleming have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19 we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. The Government will continue to work to protect customers during and after the COVID-19 crisis, and engage with the insurance industry in relation to how it responds to the needs of its customers. This commitment is included in the Programme for Government. Minister of State Fleming is due to meet with Insurance Ireland this week and the industry&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 issues will be on the agenda.</p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-24a.484.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022400067#WRJ05700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 186 together.</p><p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a social welfare payment for workers who have become unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PUP payments are classified in legislation as income supports and are subject to income tax. The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). </p><p>The Revenue Commissioners are independent in the exercise of their functions. However, they advise me as follows: </p><p>The mechanism to tax the PUP, in common with other Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments, including Jobseekers Benefit and Illness Benefit, is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands. However, in 2020 the PUP was not taxed in &lsquo;real-time'in the normal manner due to the urgent requirement to get payments to people as quickly as possible, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. This approach was based on an expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out not to be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19. Any tax liabilities on PUP payments received in 2020 will be collected, interest free, by reducing the employees&rsquo; tax credits over 4 years, starting in January 2022.  There is no change in that position which was confirmed by Revenue last September.</p><p>The continuation of the PUP into 2021 has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner for such payments. However, people receiving PUP payments in 2021 will only pay tax when they return to work. Revenue has published information on the taxation of the PUP at link<b></b>www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-circumstances/pup-tax-liability/index.aspx, which may be of interest to the Deputy. </p><p>When a PUP recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately cease the PUP claim with DSP. In turn, DSP will notify Revenue that the payment has ceased, and Revenue will then adjust the employee&rsquo;s tax credits accordingly. For a person who is on PUP at the start of the year, the weekly amount is annualised on the Tax Credit Certificate (TCC), with knock on impacts on the tax credits and standard rate cut off point, i.e. as if the person will be on the PUP for the full year. When the person comes off PUP, the TCC is then amended to reflect the actual number of weeks that the person received the (PUP) payments.</p><p>A revised instruction (Revenue Payroll Notification) will issue to the relevant employer to reflect the updated position and the revised TCC will issue to the employee via the online myAccount service.  Any delay in issuing the revised instruction to the employer will delay the employee receiving his or her full tax credit entitlements so prompt notification by the employee to the DSP is very important.</p><p>Specifically, regarding the taxation of PUP, the following important points are also relevant:</p><p>- A single person currently in receipt of the PUP will continue to receive the payment gross and tax is not collected from these payments until s/he returns to work.  This is also the case where both married spouses/civil partners are receiving PUP;</p><p>- 50% of all PUP recipients are not on the highest rate of &euro;350 per week. A single person&rsquo;s weekly tax credits will fully cover any tax due on weekly PUP payments at the &euro;203, &euro;250 and &euro;300 payment rates. For these rates, the employee will in fact have excess weekly tax credits of between &euro;3.46 and &euro;22.86 which will build up for the period s/he is out of work. This means that the employee will have additional tax credits to offset against income when s/he returns to work;</p><p>For a single person in receipt of PUP of &euro;350 per week, his/her weekly tax credits cover 90% of the tax payable, leaving tax due of approximately &euro;6.50 per week. </p><p>For example, if a single person is in receipt of the PUP for the months of January and February 2021 before then returning to work (i.e. 8 payments of PUP at &euro;350 per week, totalling &euro;2,800) the outstanding tax due on the payments received at that point is approximately &euro;52.  However, this amount will be offset fully or partly by the reduction in the total USC liability for the year because PUP payments are not liable to USC. </p><p>The position for married couples/civil partners is slightly different. Where a couple is taxed under joint assessment and one spouse or civil partner is in receipt of the PUP but does not have sufficient tax credits to cover the tax due, the tax credits of the working spouse or civil partner are reduced to ensure that the balance of the appropriate tax is collected. However, a jointly assessed couple can earn gross income (incl. PUP) of &euro;635 per week before they have a tax liability. </p><p>In taxing PUP payments in accordance with the legislation, Revenue is seeking to ensure, as far as possible, that people do not end up with a tax liability at the end of 2021 that will have to be paid in future years, particularly where there is already an underpayment in respect of 2020.  The alternative &lsquo;year-end&rsquo; approach would result in employees having further underpayments in the years ahead in addition to their 2020 liabilities, which could cause financial difficulties for them down the road. </p><p>The normal (real-time) deduction arrangements now applying to the PUP for 2021 insures against this, as tax credits are set aside for offset against any tax due (on the PUP), rather than having employees face a higher additional liability at year end.  It also ensures an equity of tax treatment between those receiving the PUP and employees who are working and receiving similar levels of wages (although the person on PUP will have a lower USC liability). </p></reply>

If a vehicle is imported from Great Britain into Ireland, the importer is required to complete a customs declaration and pay customs duty, if applicable, and VAT at 21% prior to presenting the vehicle for registration.  Under customs law, VAT at import is chargeable on the customs value of the goods.  The fact that VAT has been charged in Great Britain on used vehicles subsequently imported into the State has no bearing on their liability to VAT at import when imported into the EU.  </p><p>Under the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland will continue to apply and adhere to EU rules in relation to trade in goods with the result that there are no customs formalities, including customs declarations or payment of tariffs, on trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  On 14 January, the UK introduced significant changes to the UK VAT margin scheme for used cars imported from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. These changes are not in compliance with provisions of EU law on VAT that apply in Northern Ireland as per Article 8 of the Protocol. Accordingly, used cars that are imported into NI from GB after 31 December 2020, under the rules currently in force in the UK are not single market goods and cannot be brought into the State as if they were.  Therefore, when they are brought into the State, they are liable for VAT and duty on the same basis as used cars brought into the State from Britain. </p><p>Vehicles registered and used in Northern Ireland before the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January 2021 can be registered here in the same way as before without any check on the customs status.  </p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that from 1 January 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain where the relevant rules of origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. Under the terms of the TCA, goods of EU origin that were in use in the UK and that were subsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain will not be eligible for the 0% tariff rate as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin.</p><p>To import a car of EU origin from Great Britain into Ireland, a customs declaration must be completed. Customs duty of 10% applies on the customs value of the car. The customs value is the invoice price plus the cost of transport and insurance. VAT at 21% is calculated on the customs value plus customs duty. </p><p>I am further advised that there is a Returned Goods Relief available for vehicles subject to strict EU conditions. Vehicles can be exported from the EU to a 3<sup>rd</sup>country and re-imported into the EU without the payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief<b></b>are met. In very specific circumstances, relief from Value-Added Tax may also apply where the vehicle is re-imported into the EU by the same person that originally exported the goods out of the EU. The conditions are </p><p>- The vehicle must have been originally exported from the EU</p><p>- Must not have been altered and </p><p>- Must be re-imported within three years of export from the EU. </p><p>Details of how to claim returned goods relief for cars is on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/customs-traders-and-agents/customs-electronic-systems/aep/ecustoms-notifications/2021/ecustoms-notification-24-2021.pdf. If the car is of UK origin, it is important to note that the preferential tariff treatment must be claimed on import on the Customs declaration. Details on how to do this are also available on the Revenue website. </p><p>Cars imported into Ireland prior to 1 January 2021 can be registered as normal. The owner must provide documentation to prove that the car was imported into Ireland prior to 1 January 2021. An example of the documentation would be a sales invoice or a ferry ticket.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-24a.497.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022400067#WRJ07300"><p>The wage subsidy schemes have been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times.</p><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced on 26 March 2020 and legislated for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  Over 66,500 employers were supported through the TWSS in respect of more than 664,000 employees at a cost of &euro;2.9bn.  The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.</p><p>The stated objective of both schemes is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible, including through periods of the strictest public health restrictions that may have closed particular businesses, such as the childcare sector.  It has also applied when and as the public health restrictions have been eased to help businesses to recover from the impact of a closure or reduced trade for a period.  To that end, both supports have been available, regardless of whether or not the individual has actually been at work or not, as they are based on weekly pay to employees rather than hours worked.  For employees, the &quot;return to work&quot; therefore does not impact on the application of treatment of the subsidy. </p><p>Payments made under the TWSS are regarded as income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS which were made to the category of individuals mentioned in the Deputy's question are subject to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) in the same way as is the case in relation to other categories or worker.  While income tax and the USC on most income is deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real-time and were instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of 2020. </p><p>The taxation treatment of TWSS payments was legislated for in section 28(5)(e) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, and provides that  &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision of the Act, the additional amount paid by the employer to a specified employee in accordance with paragraph (d) shall not be regarded as emoluments of the specified employee for the purposes of Chapter 4 of Part 42 of the Act and the Regulations, but shall be treated as income chargeable to tax on the specified employee under Schedule E within the meaning of section 19 of the Act&rdquo;.</p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, which was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  The specific nature and terms of the EWSS arrangement are separate and distinct from the TWSS.  EWSS re-establishes the normal requirement to operate PAYE and normal PRSI on all payments made to the employee by the employer. Employers operate payroll as normal and report employer and employee PRSI deductions based on the employee&rsquo;s appropriate existing PRSI classes.  This ensures employee social insurance contributions accumulate as normal and furthermore, that no additional tax liability on the salary payments made should accrue to employees.</p><p>As regards the TWSS, the Government have been consistent as regards the TWSS&rsquo;s liability to tax from the outset of the payment.  Indeed, I have been advised by Revenue that it clarified the tax treatment of the TWSS at employee level in the guidance material on the TWSS that it has published on its website since the commencement of the Scheme.  Furthermore, Revenue actively engaged in facilitating webinars with the Employer Bodies, Accountancy Firms and Tax Practitioners to explain and clarify any issues for employers as regards the TWSS. For the information of the Deputy, the link directs to Revenue&rsquo;s material on Frequently Asked Questions on the TWSS:</p><p>Revenue made a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees from 15 January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement also includes information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.  In addition, the Statement provides employees with a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and indicates whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.</p><p>Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees have an opportunity to complete their income tax return for 2020, declaring any additional income and claiming any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020.</p><p>When a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments/Repayments facility in myAccount.  Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.  The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.</p><p>Finally, the Preliminary End of Year Statement sets out a provisional tax position for 2020, based on information available on Revenue records, including any Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments reported by the individual&rsquo;s employer.  Revenue published provisional statistics in relation to the preliminary end of year tax position for all PAYE taxpayers for the year 2020, on 14 January 2021 which is available to view on Revenue&rsquo;s website  PAYE Preliminary End of Year Statements.  </p></reply>

In this regard it is the clear expectation of both the Government and the Central Bank that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers &ndash; in line with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Consumer Protection Code and regulations for lenders lending to SMEs &ndash; to deliver appropriate and sustainable solutions and facilitate as many borrowers as possible to return to repaying their debt.</p>  <p>  The Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) stated last month that its members are continuing to commit significant resources to support customers impacted by COVID-19, and in particular those who are affected by the latest restrictions. Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress.</p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of COVID-19. Rather than continuing with a general 'one size fits all' forbearance approach, it is considered that it is in the best long term interests of both the borrower and lender that engagement takes place in relation to a particular loan difficulty and that the most appropriate solution to the individual case is adopted as soon as possible. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated to lenders that they should ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations. The Central Bank has also confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers at this time, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

However, insofar as it applies to the provision of mortgage credit to consumers, it should be noted that there are a number of consumer protection regulatory requirements on regulated entities. The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness. The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement. The CMCAR provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement. The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability' requirements on lenders. Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for credit is then a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. In the same way, the regulated entity will solely determine its own credit policies in line with its own risk appetite. Nevertheless, in considering applications for credit from consumers, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects lenders to assess credit applications in a sympathetic but prudent manner, ensuring at all times that the credit applicant has the means and ability to repay the proposed credit in line with the terms of the proposed credit contract. In this regard, whether an applicant for credit has had a payment break in the past should not in itself be decisive or determinative. Lenders should look at an applicant&rsquo;s overall financial position, and satisfy themselves that the applicant has the means and ability to repay the proposed credit in line with the terms of the proposed credit contract.</p>  <p>  However, If a bank customer is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to the provision of credit or any other financial service, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  Overall I expect regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will also continue to work with the Central Bank, and indeed also maintain contact with the main lenders, to ensure that appropriate arrangements and supports will be available for borrowers and other financial customers who continue to be impacted by COVID-19.</p></reply>

Some countries have sought to address this by introducing unilateral domestic digital taxes.</p>  <p>  It is my strong belief that addressing the tax challenges arising from digitalisation is a global problem which requires a global solution. That is why I fully support the OECD/G20 BEPS Inclusive Framework process where 139 jurisdictions are working together to find a sustainable solution to addressing the tax issues arising from the digitalisation of the economy. It is hoped that a comprehensive solution will be reached by mid-2021.</p>  <p>  Many countries that have introduced digital services taxes domestically also support the OECD process and envisage repealing such domestic digital taxes once global agreement has been achieved.</p>  <p>  We have also seen that the introduction of unilateral digital taxes has raised trade tensions globally. A sustainable and equitable global agreement which delivers tax certainty to business and governments is desirable as the world seeks to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-24a.527.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022400068#WRK03200"><p>I would like to advise the Deputy that, as the Minister for Finance, I am not in a position to comment on the activities of specific taxpayers. I can however provide the following overview of the tax regime applicable to different types of collective investment in Irish property.</p>  <p>  The normal tax treatment afforded to collective investment funds is that the monies invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund.  The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice.</p>  <p>  Investors in funds are generally subject to tax in their jurisdiction of residence. However investment in Irish property is an exception to this general tax treatment. Finance Act 2016 introduced the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime to address concerns regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-residents to minimise exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.</p>  <p>  An IREF is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from the withholding tax provided the appropriate declarations are in place. Non-resident investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of IREF withholding tax if the relevant tax treaty allows for this. Irish resident investors may be subject to the investment undertakings exit tax, at a rate of 41%.</p>  <p>  Investors can also invest in Irish property through a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). A REIT is a quoted company, used as a collective investment vehicle to hold rental property. The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle. REITs are publicly listed companies - therefore distributions are dividends within the scope of Dividend Withholding Tax, which applies at a rate of 25%. REITs are obliged to distribute at least 85% of profits annually.</p>  <p>  In the context of the wider residential housing market, institutional investors occupy a relatively small share of the market. Data provided by the Residential Tenancies Board in November 2020 reports that the majority (over 70%) of landlords registered a single rental tenancy, with over 96% of landlords registering 5 tenancies or less. Landlords with 5 tenancies or less account for almost 72% of all registered tenancies. Therefore, their impact on overall housing affordability, for tenants or owner-occupiers, may be limited.</p>  <p>  However, institutional investment is an important factor in increasing the overall supply of property, particularly of urban apartments, through forward-funding of development. Increasing the supply of urban apartments is essential to reach the National Planning Framework targets and commitment to a more sustainable living generally.</p>  <p>  In relation to affordability, the Programme for Government seeks to put affordability at the heart of the housing system with a commitment to prioritise the increased supply affordable homes and to ensure that local authorities are central to delivering housing, and progress a State-backed affordable home purchase scheme to promote home ownership. To this end the Cabinet recently published the Affordable Housing Bill 2020 which provides for a number of affordable purchase and cost rental schemes. In addition, progress is continuing for the establishment of the Land Development Agency on a statutory basis who will be tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, State agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase.</p></reply>

Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: .</p><p>To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its business premises.</p><p>A person whose business activity consists of the leasing of a business premises would not meet the eligibility criteria for support under the scheme because any profits derived from such a business activity would generally not be regarded as trading profits that are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D.</p><p>In circumstances where, upon a tenant terminating a lease to a business premises, a person commences to carry on a trade in 2020 from the business premises concerned, the person would be regarded as carrying on a &ldquo;new business&rdquo; for the purposes of the CRSS. A new business is a business that was established between 26 December 2019 and 12 October 2020 and such a business could qualify for the scheme where it meets the eligibility criteria.</p><p>In the case of a new business, any potential claim under the CRSS would be based on the average weekly turnover of the business in the period between the date of commencement and 12 October 2020. Where, however, the business did not operate in 2020, and therefore did not have any turnover between 26 December 2019 and 12 October 2020, the business would not be entitled to any payments under the scheme. The new business cannot use the turnover of the previous tenant for 2019 and 2020 as a basis for registering and availing of the scheme.</p><p>The Government has put in place a comprehensive range of measures to support businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.

The scheme was not intended as a support to employers who employed people for childminding duties nor was it ever implied that it applied to them.</p>  <p>  The TWSS operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully met the eligibility criteria for the scheme and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualified. To assist employers in determining their eligibility, Revenue published very extensive guidance, which clearly set out the qualifying conditions, including the requirement that a minimum 25% decline in business turnover had occurred due to COVID-19 related restrictions. </p>  <p>  The provision of childminding duties by an employee on behalf of their employer is not a business activity. A relevant business in the context of the TWSS generally includes manufacturing, buying, selling or supplying goods or services with a view to making a profit, none of which can be associated with employing a childminder. It is also not possible for a person who employs a childminder to meet the &lsquo;25% turnover&rsquo; eligibility test as there is no turnover associated with engaging a childminder.</p>  <p>  Where an employer incorrectly availed of the TWSS, then Revenue must seek full repayment of the payments made. In doing so, Revenue has assured me that it will work with employers to resolve any repayment difficulties to the greatest extent possible, providing there is meaningful engagement in concluding the matter.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that the person in question has recently engaged with Revenue regarding the TWSS debt owed and has agreed repayment terms by way of adjustments to his future tax credits.</p>  <p>  Questions relating to eligibility for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p><p>Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: </p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. A business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the qualifying activity (&ldquo;relevant business activity&rdquo;) during the period of restrictions will be no more than 25% of the &ldquo;relevant turnover amount&rdquo;. </p><p>The &ldquo;relevant turnover amount&rdquo; is calculated by reference to a business&rsquo;s average weekly turnover for the relevant business activity in a prior period, the identification of which period depends on whether the business is an &ldquo;established business&rdquo; or a &ldquo;new business&rdquo;.  An established business is a business that commenced trading prior to 26 December 2019. The relevant turnover amount for a &ldquo;new business&rdquo;, i.e. a business commenced by a person between 26 December 2019 and 12 October 2020, is based on the average weekly turnover of the business in the period from commencement to 12 October 2020.</p><p>A new business who was prohibited from operating due to Government restrictions in a week or weeks in the period from commencement to 12 October, and who can demonstrate to Revenue that the business received no turnover in that week or weeks, can exclude the week or weeks when calculating the average weekly turnover.  This ensures periods in 2020, during which a business was unable to operate because of public health restrictions, do not impact negatively on the business&rsquo;s average weekly turnover and, therefore, on its entitlements under the scheme.</p></reply>

Therefore, the condition of a property is not relevant where the property is actually occupied as a dwelling house. </p>  <p>  Where a property is not occupied and is in such bad condition that it is not suitable for occupation as a dwelling house, it is not liable to LPT. I understand that it is not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to provide a prescriptive set of criteria that a property must meet to be treated as not suitable for occupation as a dwelling house. As LPT is a self-assessment tax it is up to a property owner to assess whether a property is liable or not, and to assess the chargeable value of the property where it is liable. In cases where the property owner assesses a property as non-liable due to its being unsuitable for use as a dwelling or assesses a property at a reduced value because of structural issues, Revenue will consider the facts and circumstances of the particular case. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce an exemption along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, there are certain exceptions where:</p><p>- the house in respect of which the loan is made is, in the mortgage lender's opinion, not intended for use as the principal residence of the borrower or of his dependants,</p><p>- loans to persons who belong to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to an insurer, or which would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally,</p><p>- loans to persons who are over 50 years of age at the time the loan is approved,</p><p>- loans to persons who, at the time the loan is made, have otherwise arranged life assurance, providing for payment of a sufficient sum, in the event of death.</p><p>Within this statutory framework it is a matter for mortgage lenders to require that mortgage protection insurance is put in place in the context of mortgage credit and I have no involvement in such commercial requirements.  Also it is important to note that I have a remit over the underwriting decisions made by insurers or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. That is a commercial and operational matter for each particular insurer.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. </p><p>Nevertheless, the Central Bank has advised that in relation to insurance, and in line with previous guidance issued to the insurance industry in March 2020 (), the Central Bank expects that the insurance industry will play its part in protecting its customers during this extraordinary time, to be sensitive to the difficult situation in which many find themselves, and to take steps to support them.  At all times, the Central Bank expects firms to consider the customer impact when making decisions and to engage with customers in an open, fair and transparent manner. </p><p>Also the Deputy may wish to note that my officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers, on this issue recently. It stated that it is aware of cases where a final decision on applications is being deferred in instances where applicants have displayed symptoms of COVID-19, been referred for, or undergoing COVID-19 testing, or had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. It is normal practice to defer a decision on any condition in these cases. However, it also stated that is unlikely that once the applicant has fully recovered from an illness that it would have any impact on the policy they are seeking to take out, although this does depend on the individual case and the severity of the impact of the infection. </p><p>More generally, the Deputy will also be aware that both Minister of State Fleming and I have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19 we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  The Government will continue to work to protect customers during and after the COVID-19 crisis, and engage with the insurance industry in relation to how it responds to the needs of its customers. This commitment is included in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

MOT is an excise duty and is comprised of a carbon and a non-carbon component. The carbon component is often referred to as carbon tax, but it is only one part of the overall tax (MOT) that applies to mineral oils and other fuels used for motor and heating purposes.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s excise duty treatment of fuel used for motor and heating purposes is based on European Union law as set out in Directive 2003/96/EC on the taxation of energy products and electricity, commonly known as the Energy Tax Directive. Under this Directive, Member States are obliged to tax motor and heating fuels. However, Member States must exempt from taxation all fuels that are used for navigation within Community waters, other than fuels used for private pleasure navigation. This means that fuels used for sea-fishing and for commercial freight and passenger vessels must be exempt from taxation under the Directive. </p><p>In line with Article 14 of the Energy Tax Directive, Ireland&rsquo;s MOT legislation, set out in Finance Act 1999, provides for fuels used for the purposes of commercial sea navigation, including sea fishing to be exempt from excise duty. Section 100(2)(a) of Finance Act 1999 provides for a full relief from MOT for fuel used for commercial sea navigation, including sea-fishing. I am advised by Revenue that, subject to conditions, this relief is operated by way of remission or repayment through Revenue&rsquo;s online services. Full details on the operation of this relief are available on Revenue&rsquo;s website at: .</p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, subsidy payments of almost &euro;2 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;341m granted to over 46,800 employers in respect of over 526,800 employees.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made yesterday, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.  It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of the second quarter of 2021.</p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  It is likely that continued support will be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support at this time, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

This provides that any person servicing these loans or who holds the legal title to such loans will, unless it already falls within the regulatory remit of the Central Bank, have to be authorised as a 'credit servicing firm', by the Central Bank.  Accordingly, such firms must comply with the financial services law that applies to Central Bank &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo; and this ensures that consumers whose loans are sold or transferred to another firm maintain the same regulatory protections, including under the various Central Bank statutory Codes of Conduct, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA), which applied prior to the loan sale.  Also the contract terms and conditions of the loan will also remain unchanged following a &lsquo;loan sale&rsquo;, including those terms which govern the adjustment of the interest rate, and the new 'loan owner' will not be able to acquire any additional contractual benefits or rights solely arising from the 'loan sale'.  Therefore, any future adjustment of the interest rate on a mortgage following a &lsquo;loan sale&rsquo; will be subject to the relevant terms of the mortgage contract and, within that contractual constraint, the setting of the interest rate following a &lsquo;loan sale&rsquo; will be a commercial matter for the new &lsquo;loan owner&rsquo; or servicer.</p>  <p>  However, it should also be noted that in August 2019 the Central Bank wrote to the industry to set out its expectations of all firms in respect of sales, securitisations, purchases and transfers of residential mortgage loans. This letter including expectations in respect of the transfer of alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs) and it indicated that, where a co-operating borrower is complying with the terms of an ARA put in place, and the loan is subsequently sold to another regulated entity, the new regulated entity cannot unilaterally change the loan contract as agreed between the borrower and the original lender. The new regulated entity should continue to honour an ARA in place until review and/or expiry, as appropriate.  This includes honouring timelines and terms and conditions for reviews of the ARA.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Consumer Protection Code requires that a regulated entity must notify affected personal consumers on paper or on another durable medium of any change in the interest rate on a loan. This notification must include specific information, including details of the date from which the new rate applies, the old and new rate, the revised repayment amount, as well as an invitation for the personal consumer to contact the lender if he or she anticipates difficulties meeting the higher repayments.  In relation to variable interest rates, the Code also requires that regulated entities identify the factors which may result in changes to the variable interest rate and clearly outline the criteria and procedures applicable to the setting of the variable interest rate. </p>  <p>  Where a borrower experiences difficulties with paying a mortgage on a primary residence, the regulated firm must comply with the requirements of the CCMA. The arrears handling provisions of the Code apply when the loan is not a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies.  Furthermore, if a person is not satisfied with the with the actions of a regulated entity s/he can make a complaint to that entity and if the matter is not resolved at that level s/he can make a complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (www.fspo.ie).</p></reply>

The scheme was not intended as a support to employers who employed people for childminding duties. </p>  <p>  The provision of childminding duties by an employee on behalf of their employer is not a business activity.  A relevant business in the context of the TWSS generally includes manufacturing, buying, selling or supplying goods or services with a view to making a profit, none of which can be associated with employing a childminder.  It is also not possible for a person who employs a childminder to meet the &lsquo;25% turnover&rsquo; eligibility test as there is no turnover associated with engaging a childminder.  </p>  <p>  The TWSS operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully met the eligibility criteria for the scheme and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualified. To assist employers in determining their eligibility, Revenue published very extensive guidance, which clearly set out the qualifying conditions, including the requirement that a minimum 25% decline in business turnover had occurred due to COVID-19 related restrictions.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans at this point to revisit the parameters of the TWSS along the lines mentioned by the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market </p>  <p>  Non-performing exposures (NPEs) remain at an elevated level across the European banking system and addressing this issue is one of the key priorities for the European banking supervisor. In Ireland significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of NPEs since the financial crisis mainly through loan by loan restructuring in addition to a number of loan disposals.</p>  <p>  Despite this progress, the level of NPEs in the Irish system remains well above the European average and some time ago the supervisory authority tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge. The banks have no choice but to respond.</p>  <p>  You will recall that in 2018 my Department brought forward legislation to ensure that the contractual rights and obligations of a customer are not altered by the sale of a loan and customers will continue to benefit from, and fall under the scope of applicable regulations, whether with their bank or a 3rd party servicing entity. In this regard - the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act ensures that relevant borrowers whose loans are sold are afforded the regulatory protections they had prior to the sale. All of the customer's rights under their existing terms and conditions will remain in place post transfer.</p></reply>

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who are on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The scheme applies to VAT debts, PAYE (Employer) debts, self-assessed income tax amounts (balance of 2019 Income Tax liability and 2020 preliminary tax) and Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) overpayments.</p>  <p>  The scheme allows businesses to &lsquo;park&rsquo; these debts on an interest free basis for 12 months following the resumption of trading.  At the end of the 12-month interest free period, the warehoused debt may be paid in full without incurring an interest charge or paid through a phased payment arrangement at a significantly reduced interest rate of 3% per annum.  This compares to the standard rate of 8% or 10% per annum that would otherwise apply to such debts.</p>  <p>  Businesses that previously availed of the Debt Warehousing Scheme and subsequently resumed trading (for example, between September and December 2020 as mentioned in the case in question), can recommence availing of the support if their trade has again been impacted by the latest restrictions.  This means that they can warehouse relevant tax debts from the beginning of the initial lockdown, including in respect of the period/s during which they were trading between lockdowns.  A key requirement of the scheme is that businesses continue to file all relevant tax returns for the restricted trading period(s) even if the liability cannot be paid so that the tax debt can be quantified and warehoused.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s July Jobs Stimulus Package, a similar reduced rate of interest (3%) was made available on a short-term basis to encourage businesses enter into payment arrangements to clear tax debts that could not be warehoused, such as liabilities that arose prior to the pandemic.  This measure was introduced to provide liquidity support for businesses and sole traders that had historic unpaid tax debts across all tax types and was available for payment arrangements agreed on or before 31 October 2020.  </p>  <p>  While this arrangement is no longer available, Revenue has advised me that it will take a reasonable and pragmatic approach where it can be demonstrated that a business has genuine difficulty in addressing tax debts and will work to agree a mutually acceptable solution where there is meaningful engagement.  Revenue has also confirmed to me that if the Deputy wishes to provide the details of the case in question, it will make direct contact to discuss the difficulties and outline the possible alternatives that are available.</p></reply>

In the rules set by members, not by legislation, most credit unions cannot pay a loan interest rebate without having first approved a dividend. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank, that in a circular issued to all credit unions recently they set out their expectations on the payment of dividends and rebates.  This set out that, in the context of the 2020 year-end, credit unions must be cognisant of the significant risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit impacts potentially yet to be fully realised, not only to their own business models but to the wider economic environment.  The importance of (1) maintaining and building adequate levels of reserves, including adequate operational risk reserves, which is key to ensuring credit union financial stability and resilience and (2) the protection which capital reserves provide against the potential macroeconomic impacts of disruptive events, including capacity of credit unions to absorb credit or other losses that may arise, were also highlighted.</p>  <p>  More specifically on distributions for the 2020 year-end, given the current level of risk and uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, the Central Bank expects all credit unions to take a prudent approach. Credit unions are expected to give priority to the maintenance and building of their reserves over the payment of any distributions to members and accordingly, it is not expected that proposed distributions (dividend or loan interest rebate) by credit unions would feature in the 2020 financial year.</p>  <p>  Where a credit union may be considering a proposed distribution, my understanding is that the Central Bank expected such credit unions to contact their supervisor in the Registry of Credit Unions to clearly outline the rationale for proposing such course of action.</p></reply>

In order to claim the Stay and Spend Tax Credit, taxpayers are required to upload a copy of their receipt(s) for qualifying expenditure to the Revenue Receipts Tracker and then make a formal claim for the tax credit when submitting their annual Income Tax Return. </p>  <p>  Under the scheme a claim may be made in relation to qualifying expenditure incurred between the period 1 October 2020 and 30 April 2021.  Broadly, qualifying expenditure includes expenditure on either holiday accommodation or &ldquo;eat in&rdquo; food and drink, with a minimum expenditure amount of &euro;25 per transaction being required. </p>  <p>  Claims relating to qualifying expenditure incurred in the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 December 2020 can be made when an individual is submitting his/her 2020 Income Tax Return, which is now available for submission. </p>  <p>  As at 14 February 2021 a total of 7,799 claims have been included in 2020 Income Tax Returns.  These claims relate to &euro;2,755,230 of the qualifying expenditure recorded on the Revenue Receipts Tracker to date and the tax cost of same amounts to &euro;551,046.  However, as the filing deadline for the 2020 Income Tax Return is not until 31 October 2021, information on the total number of claims and cost for the 2020 year of assessment will not be available until after the filing date and the returns have been processed.  </p>  <p>  Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this new scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme.</p>  <p>  The scheme itself was developed at a time when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted.   Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.  A formal review has not been necessary to conclude that this has been the position. </p>  <p>  Decisions on next steps relating to the scheme have yet to be taken and I will continue to assess matters as circumstances evolve. </p>  <p>  It is important also to recall that Stay and Spend should not be viewed in isolation from the other measures put in place to support businesses generally and the hospitality sector in particular. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9 % from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity, and will apply from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021. </p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond.  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made yesterday, the scheme is being extended to the end of June 2021.  </p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with COVID-19 Plan. </p>  <p>  Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020.</p></reply>

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.  </p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover as a result of the pandemic, childcare businesses registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that there are 2,903 registered childcare service providers, registered for the EWSS.  Of the total 2,903 EWSS registered providers, 2,767 have availed of the EWSS between 21 December and 31 January.  The figures presented herein represent estimates and are reported on a cumulative basis for the scheme to-date.  It was not possible to identify the number of childcare service providers who availed of the scheme in each week since 21 December due to the mix of pay frequencies evident in the scheme operations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-24a.627.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022400070#WRM02500"><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme provided the payment of income supports to employers in respect of eligible employees, where the employer&rsquo;s business activities had experienced significant negative disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The scheme was available to all employers, irrespective of how that employer operates (i.e. limited company, sole trade, partnership etc.).  However, self-employed individuals may have been eligible for the Department of Social Protection administered COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment scheme.  Revenue advise me that the numbers of self-employed people in receipt of PUP are not readily available.</p>  <p>  Payments made under the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) are income supports and share the characteristics of income.  The PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare type payments and, thus, is chargeable to income tax, but exempt from the USC and PRSI charges.  This will be the case whether, prior to receipt of the PUP, the recipient was a PAYE worker or a self-employed individual.  </p>  <p>  The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 and the legislation reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare benefits, including jobseekers benefit for the self-employed, which is to tax the benefits on an actual basis under Schedule E.  Being taxed on an actual basis means that for each tax year, recipients of the PUP are taxed on the payments that are received in the corresponding calendar year.  This is the case regardless of the period for which a self-employed individual carrying on a trade or profession prepares his or her accounts for that trade or profession.  </p>  <p>  Outstanding liabilities for self-employed tax-payers are not treated in the same manner as outstanding liabilities for PAYE only tax-payers arising from receipt of the wage supports.</p>  <p>  Self-assessed individuals, i.e. chargeable persons, who have income from non-PAYE sources are obliged to file a tax return and account for all their income including the PUP in their tax return.  This is the case whether or not such individuals were in receipt of the PUP.  </p>  <p>  The 2020 tax return would be due to be filed by 31st October 2021, and any balance of tax owing would normally be due to be paid at the same time.  However, there is provision in Finance Act 2020 which expands the debt warehousing scheme to include taxpayers who self-assess for income tax.  The scheme is available to any self-assessed taxpayer (including a proprietary director) who expects that her/his income for 2020 will be more than 25% lower than her/his income for 2019 and as a result s/he is unable to pay the balance of income tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax 2020.  ROS filers had until 10 December to pay and file their 2019 Form 11 and to pay preliminary tax for 2020.  This deadline also applied to ROS filers who wished to avail of the debt warehousing scheme.  </p>  <p>  Where a taxpayer is eligible for warehousing, collection of these liabilities may be suspended for a period of 12 months from 31 October / 10 December, as appropriate.  Warehoused liabilities will be subject to no interest for this 12 month period and a reduced interest rate of c. 3% per annum thereafter until paid in full. </p>  <p>  If income for 2021 is also more than 25% lower than income for 2019, the balance of 2020 Income Tax and Preliminary Tax for 2021 may be warehoused.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, where a self-employed individual incurs a loss for a year of assessment, a provision is available that allows the individual to elect to have that loss offset sideways against other income of the individual, or in cases of joint assessment, against income of the individual&rsquo;s spouse/civil partner. Therefore, where an individual has incurred a loss in 2020, they may utilise this loss to shelter a tax liability arising from receipt of the PUP. </p>  <p>  Finally, tax clearance certificates are available where Returns Filing and Tax Payments are kept up to date and Payment Agreements entered into are adhered to.  This includes Warehousing.</p></reply>

As widely expected, NatWest confirmed that it intends withdrawing from the banking sector in the Republic of Ireland and has begun the process of winding down its ROI Ulster Bank business.</p>  <p>  As part of this process, NatWest confirmed that it is in negotiations with AIB in relation to the sale of a portfolio of performing commercial loans estimated to be worth approximately &euro;4bn.  NatWest and AIB have signed a Memorandum of Understanding in this regard.

As widely expected, NatWest confirmed that it intends withdrawing from the banking sector in the Republic of Ireland and gradually wind down its Ulster Bank business.</p>  <p>  NatWest concluded that Ulster Bank would not be able to achieve an acceptable level of return for shareholders and have decided to begin a phased withdrawal over the coming years. </p>  <p>  NatWest has committed to seeking solutions where:</p>  <p>  - Customers and colleagues are well supported; </p>  <p>  - Job losses are minimised with no new compulsory redundancy departures this year; </p>  <p>  - Stability is maintained in the sector; and</p>  <p>  - NatWest&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Irish banking sector is achieved in an orderly manner.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have engaged with Ulster Bank, its parent company, NatWest and the Financial Services Union (FSU) prior to this announcement. In all of these engagements, I strongly emphasised the importance of timely communication with customers, staff and other stakeholders in relation to strategic decisions regarding Ulster Bank.  I also met with the FSU on Friday morning after the announcement and I have committed to further engagement with the FSU in relation to this issue. </p>  <p>  At this point in time I cannot reveal any detail of discussions with AIB and Permanent TSB (PTSB) for confidentiality and stock market abuse reasons. I am supportive of trying to bring about an outcome that is good for both AIB and PTSB, but more importantly Ulster Bank&rsquo;s customers, staff and the Irish economy generally.</p>  <p>  I understand, that there are approximately 2,800 staff employed some of whom are located in Northern Ireland. Whilst the management of staff matters, including staffing levels, is entirely a matter for Ulster Bank and any counterparty who acquires its business, I would expect all stakeholders to be very sensitive in relation to the needs and rights of staff. This includes full compliance with European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (TUPE Regulations), and honouring all agreements in place between the bank and staff representative bodies.  In addition, I would expect these entities to engage with staff representative bodies as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that Ulster Bank&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Irish market must be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Irish financial services legislation, including the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes of conduct. </p>  <p>  Provision 3.11 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 requires that a regulated entity that intends to cease operating, merge with another, or to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated entity must:</p>  <p>  - notify the Central Bank immediately;</p>  <p>  - provide affected consumers with at least two months&rsquo; notice to enable them to make alternative arrangements if they so wish;</p>  <p>  - ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to any transfer, merger or cessation of operations; or, in the case of a transfer or merger, inform customers as to how continuity of service will be provided following a transfer or merger; and</p>  <p>  - in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform customers that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case.</p>  <p>  In relation to loans, where they are sold or transferred to another regulated entity, the consumer protections in place for borrowers will not change and the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections continue to apply.  All mortgages or loans which are sold or assigned to a new creditor will continue to be subject to the terms of the contract as entered into by the borrower.  As a matter of contractual law, the new creditor will not be able to unilaterally change the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm, if it is not already regulated as a credit institution or a retail credit firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (Code) and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA).</p></reply>

This scheme ended on 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employer Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020. </p>  <p>  The transitional phase of TWSS operated until 3 May 2020 and provided a subsidy of 70% of the average net weekly pay up to a maximum of &euro;410 in respect of eligible employees.  The operational phase of the scheme was introduced from 4 May 2020 and included increased subsidy rates up to 85%, to a maximum subsidy payment of &euro;410.  The operational phase also included a tapering mechanism that ensured the subsidy payment plus any additional payment by the employer did not exceed the employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;normal&rsquo; average weekly wage (ARNWP).  This ARNWP, was calculated using the pay and tax details as reported to Revenue in the employer&rsquo;s payroll submission for each pay date in January and February 2020.   </p>  <p>  Under the TWSS the employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain employees&rsquo; net income for the duration of the scheme. However, there was no legal requirement for an employer to pay an additional gross (top up) payment that fully or partially made up the difference between the amount provided by the subsidy scheme and the employee&rsquo;s normal wage (ARNWP).  The TWSS legislation also required employers to separately identify subsidy payments on employee payslips from any top-up payments made.</p>  <p>  Regarding an employee&rsquo;s ultimate tax liability, the TWSS payments were subject to income tax and the Universal Social Charge (USC) but were taxed at the end of the year rather than the normal (real-time) manner that operates through the PAYE system.  Any top-up payments made by the employer continued to be taxed in real-time.  The EWSS has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner and will not result in employees having tax/USC undercharges at year-end for 2021.</p>  <p>  Revenue provided a 2020 Preliminary End of Year Statement to all employees in January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The preliminary statement sets out the detail of the employee&rsquo;s income for the year according to the payroll submissions received from the employer and includes any TWSS payments received.  The statement also provides a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and indicates whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.  The employee can then claim any additional benefits, for example, health expenses, to arrive at the final liability for 2020. Where a tax liability still exists, after all tax credits have been allocated, the amount owed can be paid as single payment or can be paid over four years from 1 January 2022 (interest free) by reducing the employee&rsquo;s tax credits.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the employer in question operated the TWSS on behalf of its employees from 3 April 2020 to 31 August 2020.  Following a review of the matter, Revenue is satisfied that the business operated the scheme correctly and took account of any top-up payments made to the employees in calculating the amount of subsidy due, having regard to each employee&rsquo;s ARNWP.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-24a.650.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022400070#WRM04900"><p>At the outset, while I have an appreciation of the specific issue the Deputy raises, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter. In addition, we cannot compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or groups, such as businesses or community service providers. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that firms will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  For example, factors may include the policyholder&rsquo;s type of business/service; their size; their claims record; and so on.  Different factors will apply to different insurance products, and the weighting of each factor could possibly vary from year to year. Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market, demonstrating why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies.</p>  <p>  While the Government cannot direct the pricing of insurance products, it can introduce reforms to assist in bringing the cost of insurance down.  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Insurance Reform contains a range of deliverables, including legislation where required, in a number of Government Department policy areas.  Work is already under way in relation to certain areas, including:</p>  <p>  - increasing market transparency through the National Claims Information Database (NCID), including for employer and public liability insurance; </p>  <p>  - reviewing the duty of care legislation;</p>  <p>  - providing for the Judicial Council&rsquo;s accelerated adoption by 31 July 2021 of new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum;</p>  <p>  - consideration by the Department of Justice of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Capping Damages in Personal Injuries Actions; and,</p>  <p>  - looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</p>  <p>  Recognising that many businesses and self-employed persons need to see the impact of these reforms as soon as possible, the Action Plan contains 66 actions, 95% of which are due to be completed by the end of 2021.  The focus is clearly on completing these actions in the short to medium term.  I am hopeful that key reforms around personal injury awards may start to have an impact during this year on the pricing and availability of insurance. </p>  <p>  As mentioned previously, it is important that policyholders shop around for insurance at renewal.  In that regard, I would also highlight to the Deputy that an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has now been established in my Department.  This will provide for more joined-up policy response on promoting competition in this sector, as well as provide for greater information to assist consumers and businesses to assist with shopping around.  Minister of State Fleming will report to the Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform on the work of the Office.</p>  <p>  Finally, where a policyholder feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider.  The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

Details of the respective options&rsquo; assessment process can be found in the Preliminary Options Report for UoM09 at floodinfo.ie/publications/</p>  <p>  No further tidal options were assessed for River Liffey in the Dublin City AFA in the Eastern CFRAM Study due the presence of proposed/ongoing schemes at the time of the Study (as below), and the limited risk predicted by the modelling under the existing scenario in the areas not covered by the proposed/ongoing schemes i.e. along the Quays. </p>  <p>  Prior to this, a pre-feasibility level of assessment of a tidal barrage for Dublin was carried out as part of the Dublin City Council&rsquo;s 'Project 2030 - Integrated Water Resource Management Planning for the Dublin City/Dublin Coastal Region' (Pre-Feasibility Study, June 2009).  Dublin City Council was the Client for this project.  While this project examined a range of combinations of river and marine hydraulic events and demonstrated that the construction of a system of barrages could be a viable flood prevention strategy for Dublin, it also recommended that many detailed studies to address other issues would be necessary if the project progresses.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, works on the South Campshires Flood Protection Project are substantially complete, with the OPW&rsquo;s direct labour crew now finished on site.  While Dublin City Council are currently addressing some final elements of the project, flood protection is currently provided.  &euro;6.3 million has been spent on this project to date. </p>  <p>  The Spencer Dock Flood Relief Scheme is also complete, having been initiated in 2006 following major flooding in 2000, and constructed from 2007 to 2009.  The scheme, which comprises the restoration of a sea lock, provides protection against a 100-Year flood (1% Annual Exceedance Probability) for 1,200 properties against flooding from the River Liffey.</p>  <p>  The management of potential increases in future flood risk due to climate change will also be assessed under actions set out in the Climate change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for Flood Risk Management (OPW, 2019).  These will include examining past schemes for adaptation requirements, and the ongoing examination of potential future flood risk in areas currently not prone to flooding, and of options for managing and mitigating this risk.</p></reply>

Some 2,100km of channel and some 135km of embankments are maintained annually. </p>  <p>  In total, the OPW has responsibility for the maintenance of over 11,500km of channel and some 800km of embankments. In relation to the arterial drainage schemes, the OPW carries out these works in order to ensure that the level of drainage afforded to the benefiting agricultural lands is maintained. Arterial drainage maintenance provides benefit to in excess of 242,800 hectares (600,000 acres) of agricultural land and provides a level of flood protection to in excess of twenty thousand dwellings and properties located within the benefiting lands and over seven thousand properties which are located behind scheme embankments. In addition, a significant level of flood protection is afforded to dwellings, properties and infrastructure in the towns and villages through which these arterial drainage scheme channels flow.</p>  <p>  These maintenance works are carried out in accordance with relevant legislation, through a range of environmental assessments, including Strategic Environmental Assessments, Appropriate Assessments and Ecological Assessments.  These maintenance operations are carried out in line with the OPW&rsquo;s Environmental Guidance,  Drainage Maintenance and Construction Procedures. This guidance was developed in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Inland Fisheries Ireland.   Benefiting opportunities are often taken, both directly and in conjunction with other agencies, to include environmental enhancement measures as part of their maintenance operations. At a number of locations on schemes, the OPW in co-operation with landowners and other stakeholders are managing/controlling invasive species. The Environmental Guidance, together with the current Strategic Environmental Assessment 2018-2021 which is aligned with the six year reporting cycles of the Water Framework Directive and the Floods Directive and, the current 5 Yearly Appropriate Assessments are available on the OPW Website.</p>  <p>  The OPW also provides funding under the Minor Works Flood Mitigation and Coastal Protection Scheme to Local Authorities with a clear requirement that the Local Authorities are responsible for undertaking the works in compliance with environmental legislation.</p>  <p>  The OPW does not record expenditure on vegetation management activities separately from channel maintenance, embankment maintenance and refurbishment, repairs and refurbishment to sluices, bridges, pumping stations and barrages on its drainage maintenance activities. The OPW does not have information broken down by county as the schemes are in the main catchment drainage schemes which traverse county boundaries.</p></reply>

National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations.  Public procurement rules include provisions addressing EU and national legislation on the protection of labour rights. </p>  <p>  As a consequence, public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts and applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social welfare contributions.  They are also obliged to declare whether they have breached aspects of employment law.</p>  <p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p>  <p>  The Capital Works Management Framework, (CWMF), managed by my Department, through the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), provides the necessary tools for Contracting Authorities to manage the procurement process and to ensure adequate supervision and oversight on construction projects.  This Framework is mandated for use on all capital funded construction projects. The provisions include the conditions of the Public Works Contract which outline the functions of the contract administrator; the Employer's Representative during the construction stage of a project as well as dedicated guidance, (Guidance Note 3.1-Implementation Process), on the management and oversight of the project once works commence.</p>  <p>  A Sectoral Employment Order (SEO) fixes the statutory minimum rates of pay and other conditions for example, sick pay and pension entitlements for persons employed in a given economic sector. An employer in that sector has a legal duty to comply, at minimum, with those terms. </p>  <p>  Clause 5.3 of the public works contracts contains provisions about Pay and Conditions of Employment which applies to all those engaged on the works, regardless of whether they are employed by the contractor or their subcontractors. </p>  <p>  This clause requires the contractor to be compliant with certain aspects of employment and health and safety law.  It also requires a contractor to ensure that all deductions from payments to workers as required by Law, are paid accordingly.</p>  <p>  The main contractor is obliged to display a copy of the Pay and Conditions of Employment clause from the public works contract in a prominent place on the site for the benefit of all those employed on the project.</p>  <p>  The main contractor is required to provide a certificate of compliance (titled &lsquo;Rates of Pay and Conditions of Employment Certificate&rsquo;) with each interim statement submitted (normally on a monthly basis). Failure to provide this compliance certificate will result in payment not being made by the contracting authority. If a main contractor provides a certificate of compliance that is subsequently found to be untrue or partly untrue the contracting authority has the right to deduct the money relating to the work or part of the work covered by the certificate from any sums due to the main contractor. This money can be withheld until the pay and conditions of employment issue is made right. The ultimate sanction if a main contractor continues to be non-compliant is for the contract to be terminated.</p>  <p>  The public works contracts also oblige a contractor to maintain records of pay, timesheets and any deductions made on behalf of all those employed on the site.  These records are subject to inspections by representatives of the contracting authority as required.</p>  <p>  In summary a contracting authority has the right to: to withhold payment if certification of compliance with the provisions of clause 5.3 is not provided; audit specified documents; deduct from payment if certification is proven to be incorrect; and terminate the agreement where the contractor fails to remedy the situation. </p>  <p>  The foregoing are contractual remedies available to the contracting authority where there is evidence of non-compliance.  There is also a statutory framework in place to enforce employment law.  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an office under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is a statutory office and is independent in the exercise of its functions. The role of the WRC is to achieve compliance with employment legislation, including SEOs. Employees whose rights under an SEO have not been complied with can refer the matter to the WRC for investigation.</p>  <p>  My Department would not typically receive complaints of non-compliance with employment law for particular projects. Such complaints would go to the relevant contracting authority or directly to the WRC.</p></reply>

Around 600 organisations have benefited from these significant supports, specifically aimed at addressing funding challenges for groups delivering important services for citizens and in many cases for vulnerable groups. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware there are also a range of existing income and liquidity supports in place across Government, supporting organisations which operate across many sectors including the community sector.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the Department of Rural and Community Development also operate a number of schemes which can benefit local community groups. In particular the Community Services Programme, with funding of almost &euro;49 million available in 2021, supports over 400 community organisations throughout the county. A Covid-19 support fund is in place to support Community Services Programme funded organisations facing funding challenges due to Covid-19. In addition, in 2020, the Community Enhancement Fund supported over 3,000 projects including funding for childcare groups, recreational groups and elderly support groups, and there is funding of &euro;4.5m available for this fund in 2021. </p>  <p>  I should also bring the Deputy's attention to the recent announcement by Minister Humphreys of &euro;800,000 to support the regeneration of social enterprises, to help them recover from the devastating impact of Covid-19 on their activities. The programme, which is funded through the Dormant Accounts Fund, will provide free training and mentoring to social enterprise managers, directors and staff across the country. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Government has provided and is continuing to provide a range of sectoral and horizontal Covid supports for the community sector.  The ongoing requirement for such supports will be kept under review by Government.</p></reply>

The current epidemiological situation is such that it does not permit Government consideration at this time of the resumption of football training. The Government's clear message at the present time is for people to stay in their homes, unless necessary for those essential reasons set out in the public health regulations.</p>  <p>  The Government has this week published the COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021 &ndash; The Path Ahead and agreed that the public health restrictions will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The public health advice is that it is too early to say how and when other restrictions should be eased given current uncertainties. Government will meet in advance of the 5th of April to review the level of restrictions. The focus of the assessment, based on the public health advice, will be on achieving the following before any significant easing of measures is contemplated: Disease prevalence (case numbers/incidence) is brought to much lower levels that can be managed and controlled by public health and that the reproduction number (&ldquo;R&rdquo; number) is such that we can be confident that we can continue to suppress the 1. disease e.g. at or below</p>  <p>  2. Hospital and critical care occupancy are reduced to low levels to protect the health service and allow for the safe resumption of non-COVID-19 care.</p>  <p>  3. Ongoing and steady progress on the vaccination programme such that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination.</p>  <p>  4. Emerging information on variants of concern.</p>  <p>  Any easing of measures should be slow and gradual with sufficient time between phases to assess impact and to respond if the epidemiological situation was to deteriorate. It will take account of emerging international and national evidence and experience and with a specific focus on supporting mental health and wellbeing. The Government has agreed that the following areas may be considered if the situation improves sufficiently:</p>  <p>  - Some easing of restrictions on outdoor activities and meetings beyond 1 other household.</p>  <p>  - Consideration of extending the current 5km limit.</p>  <p>  - Staggered start of easing of other areas of activity with a focus on outdoor activities including sport and some areas of construction.</p>  <p>  Minister Martin and I will continue our engagement with Sport Ireland and the sporting bodies with a view to bringing proposals at the appropriate time for consideration by Government, in consultation with NPHET and the public health authorities.</p></reply>

This introduced digital legal deposit in Ireland. Allied to that is the challenge of archiving the web and the difficulties of collecting, preserving and providing access to information as digital content grows at an unprecedented rate.  Since 2011, as part of its mission is to collect, protect and make available the recorded memory of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland (NLI), has selectively archived the web, moving toward the creation of an archive of Irish websites.  Web archiving is the process of  &ldquo;harvesting&rdquo; portions of the web and preserving the collections in an archival format to ensure it remains accessible in the future.  The harvested sites are preserved sometimes long after the original site has disappeared.  An archived website is fully functioning and can be navigated like a live website.</p><p>The NLI&rsquo;s web archiving activity since 2011 has collected websites of important events in Irish life.  The collection includes inter alia websites such as government websites, websites for sporting events, festivals, elections, referenda and websites of political parties.  The archived website or social media account forms part of the national collection and are available at <i></i>.</p><p>The NLI identifies websites and social media accounts for inclusion in its web archive in line with the Library&rsquo;s collection development policy.  The public is encouraged to recommend websites through a nomination form on the website. As web-archiving in Ireland is by notification, website and social media account owners are notified of the NLI's intent to include them in the web archive.  They can decline at any point to being included in the web archive.  Sites are collected by a &lsquo;web crawler&rsquo; which is a piece of automated software designed to capture websites at a particular point in time.  The crawler downloads code, images, documents and other files that are essential to reproducing the website and its contents so that it is as similar to its original form as possible. Allied to this, my Department is working with the NLI on a report exploring the feasibility of expanding the NLI&rsquo;s capacity to establish a digital legal deposit scheme to serve as a web archive for the .ie domain.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-24a.732.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022400072#WRO00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 278 together.</p>  <p>  I recognise the essential role of the local print media sector as the providers of reliable and relevant local news. The importance of a strong and independent media sector has been highlighted in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The production and publication of newspapers, journals and periodicals and the distribution of those publications has been listed as an essential service. </p>  <p>  The sector faces a fall in revenue arising from the pandemic, but also longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue. </p>  <p>  In recognition of these longer term challenges, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.  The Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, recently concluded a public consultation to which a number of stakeholders in the print sector have made submissions. The Commission is currently in the process of engaging with key stakeholders in a series of thematic dialogues. I look forward to receiving the Commission's Report on the completion of its work which will inform media policy, including print media, over the next 10 years. </p>  <p>  Commercial radio is supported by a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and largely funded by the television licence. This scheme is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is administered on an independent basis by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. There is no equivalent statutory scheme for the print sector but recommending an approach to the longer term sustainability of media, including the print sector, is among the matters to be considered by the Future of Media Commission. In terms of specific supports for the sector, it is of particular importance in relation to media organisations to avoid any perception of Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue.</p>  <p>  I am however cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces. The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers. </p>  <p>  Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have engaged in meeting key stakeholders including Newsbrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  Work is continuing to explore the issues arising, with a follow up meeting between my officials and the NUJ taking place on 3rd February. I had a further meeting with Local Ireland on Wednesday 17th February and I have asked my officials to continue engagement with Local Ireland to further explore the issues facing the sector. </p>  <p>  My officials have also raised with the Government Information Service the importance of including the local  print sector in Government advertising spend, and I understand that the sector received &euro;3.4m of advertising spend related to COVID-19 in 2020. The sector is also included in the current resilience campaign. </p>  <p>  The enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the consequent establishment of a Media Commission is a commitment in the Programme for Government. Following Government approval of additional provisions on 8 December 2020, the finalised General Scheme was published and the Department is working closely with the  Office of the Attorney General in relation to the drafting of the Bill.  The General Scheme was also referred to the relevant Joint Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny which has now commenced. </p>  <p>  A free and pluralistic media is an essential component of a democratic society as the over concentration of media ownership into a small number of hands represents a potential harm to media plurality and runs counter to the public interest. In this context, the Competition Act 2002 (as amended) provides that all media mergers must be notified to me and that I must make a determination within 30 working days as to whether or not the proposed media merger may proceed based on an assessment of its impact on the plurality of media in the State. Every Ministerial determination since the establishment of the process has been made within the statutory 30 working day timeline. </p>  <p>  The review of the Defamation Act 2009 is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</p></reply>

Sport Ireland provides funding to Cycling Ireland to support the operation of its high performance programme. There are two streams of funding allocated by Sport Ireland which are central to the delivery of Cycling Ireland&rsquo;s programme including High Performance Programme Funding and the International Carding Scheme.</p>  <p>  High Performance Programme Funding is provided to support a range of activities including salaries, training camps and competitions at junior and senior level, pathway development, and performance services. In 2020, Cycling Ireland received &euro;440,000 in High Performance Programme Funding.</p>  <p>  The International Carding Scheme provides financial support to athletes for their training and competition programmes. The primary purpose of this funding is to support Irish athletes in reaching finals and achieving medals at European, World, Olympic and Paralympic level. The Scheme is criteria based, requiring athletes to achieve standards set forth by their NGB in agreement with Sport Ireland. These standards are based on performances achieved at international competitions. Athletes are considered and approved for funding by Sport Ireland based on applications received from Cycling Ireland. As part of the International Carding Scheme Sport Ireland allocated &euro;426,000 to Cycling Ireland, which was made up of &euro;224,000 for their Olympic Programme and &euro;202,000 for their Paralympic Programme.</p>  <p>  Further to those listed on the International Carding Scheme, Sport Ireland recognises that there will be other athletes who will require support from the NGB, specifically those who are tracking to compete in Paris 2024. Sport Ireland has recently engaged with Cycling Ireland who have confirmed their intention to establish an alternative mechanism of support for those athletes which may include service provision, training camp and competition exposure, or direct athlete funding through alternative resources. Cycling Ireland will be responsible for developing this mechanism of support recognising it must be sport specific and reflective of the capacity within the NGB. </p></reply>

The Report made 11 Specific Conclusions and Recommendations, many of which reflect or complement the actions set out in the Audiovisual Action Plan which is in train and whose implementation is overseen by a Steering Group comprising representatives from across Government. In May of 2019, the D&aacute;il debated a motion regarding the Report and the Minister set out progress in implementing the recommendations of the JOC Report. </p>  <p>  Recommendations 1, 3, 5, and 11 have been addressed under revisions to the section 481 tax incentive. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 1 states that &ldquo;section 481 is a key and central component within the Irish Film Industry". Changes were made to section 481 in the Finance Act 2018, improving administrative processes and to extend the tax credit beyond its 2020 deadline to 2024. The Regional Film Development Uplift was also introduced. This is a short-term, tapered relief providing additional credit, commencing at 5%, for films made in an area designated as an assisted region under the State aid regional guidelines. The regional uplift will be phased out on a tiered basis. Changes made in Budget 2021 mean that the credit is available for an extra year at 5% in 2021, 3% in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2022, 2% in respect of claims made on or before 31 December 2023, and reducing to 0% from year 2024 on. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 3 sought &ldquo;the reform of training in the sector to ensure that all training has a recognised qualification where possible, has a beginning and an end, and that trainees are not forced to repeat specific training&rdquo;. The Committee also recommended a wider geographical spread of training courses, the introduction of formal apprenticeships and additional finance to improve this training and development. The Regional Uplift measure outlined above is specifically designed to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector and ensure a spread of production activity beyond the current traditional production hubs in Ireland by incentivising the training and development of new, local pools of talent in the film sector in areas outside the current main production hubs.  Changes to Section 481 in 2019 has seen a strong focus on life-long learning and a more expansive range of skills development at all levels, including hard skills, soft skills, future skills, technical skills and leadership skills.  As part of an application for section 481, many companies are now required to work with Screen Ireland to develop training plans that consider the skills needs of the production, the company, the participant and the sector as a whole and to reflect on how the planned activity will address skills needs across different levels and different departments of the production from new entrants, trainees and crew to above the line talent and company leaders. This is designed to move away from a system where individuals are labelled as trainees and in doing so, addresses the concerns that the Committee flagged. Screen Skills Ireland, the training and skills development division of Screen Ireland, established a Screen Industry Education Forum in November 2018.  This event brings together industry stakeholders and education providers on a regular basis to focus on the skills development challenges and opportunities facing the screen sectors in Ireland. Due to COVID-19, it did not prove possible to host the event in 2020 but it is intended to hold the event again in 2021 if the circumstances allow. Screen Skills Ireland frequently collaborates with education providers to develop and deliver accredited/certified programmes for participants in a range of roles and at all stages of their careers, and which emphasise inclusion and progression.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 5 outlined that an &ldquo;international comparative study should be constituted to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the Section 481 tax credit&rdquo;. Since the  publication of the Report, as part of its work for the Finance Bill 2018, the Department of Finance published its review of the section titled &lsquo;Review IV:  Cost Benefit Analysis of Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 &ndash; Film Corporation Tax Credit&rsquo;.  This analysis was the catalyst for the administrative changes to the section 481 application process. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 11 called for &ldquo;Public funding and adherence to employment standards&rdquo; to be linked. The Film Regulations 2019, introduced to give effect to changes in the section 481 procedures, include a requirement to provide a signed undertaking in respect of quality employment which requires both the producer company and the qualifying company to comply with all obligations in the field of environmental, social and employment law.  The producer company and the qualifying company must be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer, have in place written policies and procedures in on Grievances, Discipline and Dignity at work (including harassment, bullying and equal opportunity).  The companies are also required to provide details of any Work Place Relations Commission decisions aligned with confirmation that any findings against the companies have been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed. This also addresses Recommendation 2 of the Report which expressed concerns with regard to working terms and conditions. While matters relating to collective bargaining rights of freelance workers do not fall directly under my remit, my Department has used the opportunities presented by the changes made to the section 481 procedures to improve conditions in the industry particularly in relation to training commitments by producer companies.  Recommendation 8 also deals with working conditions and more particularly, calls for state support for &ldquo;the precarious existence of actors and sustainable pension structures for workers within the Irish film industry&rdquo;. This comes within the remit of the Department of Social Protection, who passed legislation in the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 in December 2018 which addresses insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. The Social Welfare Scheme for Self-Employed Artists has also been extended to the wider creative community which means that self-employed artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance for the first year that they are out of work will be able to focus on their artistic work and developing their portfolio, rather than having to participate in the normal labour market activation activities. Artists eligible to apply to the scheme include actors, theatre and film directors, dancers, opera singers, set, costume and lighting designers, musicians, composers, choreographers, architects and street performers. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, which was a commitment in the Programme for Government, and which was published in 2020. That report outlined ten recommendations, including a proposed mechanism for rolling out of Universal Basic Income (UBI) through the establishment of a pilot project which would last three years. There is already a commitment in the Programme for Government to assess a pilot UBI and one that is informed by a review of previous international models. While my responsibilities as Minister do not encompass a UBI scheme, building on the  recommendation of the Taskforce, officials in my Department are engaging on this matter with the relevant Government Departments including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 6 called for workers within the craft grades of the industry to have representatives nominated to the Irish Film Board to feed in their perspectives and needs into the industry&rsquo;s development. However, under the provisions of the Irish Film Board Acts 1980 to 2018, the Board of Screen Ireland as it is now known is not a representative board in the sense of comprising representatives from the various industry sectors:  Section 12 of the Act provides that 7 members shall be appointed to the Board by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Vacancies arose on the Board in 2020 and were advertised by the Public Appointments Service in October 2020. In the call for expressions of interest, applications were sought from people with a broad range of profiles and skillsets.  Appointments to the new board are expected in the coming weeks. Members of all State Boards are required to act on a fully informed basis, in good faith, with due diligence and care, and in the best interest of the State body, and are subject to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies 2016.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 9 sought for the further integration of the film industry on a north/south basis with the creation of formal north/south structures, development plans and investment.  While Screen Ireland competes with Northern Ireland Screen in its efforts to attract inward production into the Republic of Ireland, it also regularly cooperates with Northern Ireland Screen in efforts to attract inward production to the island of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 4 saw the Committee call on the Irish Film Board to constitute the Board&rsquo;s Film Forum, with an independent Chair, in order to allow all stakeholders within the sector to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry while Recommendation 10 called on the unions and the representative organisations to work towards a mutually beneficial and respectful understanding.  As my predecessor previously set out to the House, despite efforts made by Screen Ireland in 2019, it did not prove possible to constitute a forum of all stakeholders that would adopt a collaborative approach as suggested by the Report. Instead, it seemed that the forum would simply comprise of the airing of disputes and grievances which are more properly dealt with by the State through other mechanisms such as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). In 2020, the WRC published a report following its audit of the Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector. The audit set out to:</p>  <p>  -  examine industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedure,</p>  <p>  -  assess issues arising (if any), and</p>  <p>  -  make recommendations for their improvement where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The WRC received submissions from thirty-four groups and individuals from across the sector and made 4 recommendations.  </p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the WRC report was that an agreement be negotiated by the principal parties in the sector for their members, addressing pay, terms and conditions such as hours of work, per diems, travel time, overtime, sick leave and pensions, could be adopted as the industry norm.  Shortly after the publication of the WRC report came the very welcome announcement in December last by Screen Producers Ireland (SPI) and SIPTU that SIPTU members had approved a new Shooting Crew Agreement. This concluded over 3 years of negotiations between SPI and SIPTU in developing a modernised Crew Agreement which will act as a framework for the industry. Of particular importance is that the agreement implements an industry pension scheme operating under the Construction Workers Pension Scheme (CWPS) and establishes a monitoring structure to oversee the operation of the agreement. It also includes a commitment to developing the first Work/Life Balance policy for the film and television industry. SPI has also delivered a number of workshops on HR best practice. The WRC Report acknowledged the value of continued skills development and work in this regard continues under the auspices of the audiovisual action plan. Screen Skills Ireland are also currently working with the Guilds to support development of competency frameworks. They also offer courses that support the Guilds in other ways and will examine the development of a training module, which was another proposal of the WRC. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work through the Audiovisual High Level Steering Group to address issues raised in the audiovisual industry, and to support the industry and the people who work in it. Officials continue to engage with stakeholders and through Screen Ireland to address matters arising, including the ongoing COVID19 challenges.</p></reply>

The current epidemiological situation is such that it does not permit Government consideration at this time of the reopening of golf courses. The Government's clear message at the present time is for people to stay in their homes, unless necessary for those essential reasons set out in the public health regulations.</p><p>The Government has this week published the COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021 &ndash; The Path Ahead and agreed that the public health restrictions will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The public health advice is that it is too early to say how and when other restrictions should be eased given current uncertainties. Government will meet in advance of the 5<sup>th</sup>of April to review the level of restrictions. The focus of the assessment, based on the public health advice, will be on achieving the following before any significant easing of measures is contemplated:</p><p>1. Disease prevalence (case numbers/incidence) is brought to much lower levels that can be managed and controlled by public health and that the reproduction number (&ldquo;R&rdquo; number) is such that we can be confident that we can continue to suppress the disease e.g. at or below 1.</p><p>2. Hospital and critical care occupancy are reduced to low levels to protect the health service and allow for the safe resumption of non-COVID-19 care.</p><p>3. Ongoing and steady progress on the vaccination programme such that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination.</p><p>4. Emerging information on variants of concern.</p><p>Any easing of measures should be slow and gradual with sufficient time between phases to assess impact and to respond if the epidemiological situation was to deteriorate. It will take account of emerging international and national evidence and experience and with a specific focus on supporting mental health and wellbeing. The Government has agreed that the following areas may be considered if the situation improves sufficiently:</p><p>-  Some easing of restrictions on outdoor activities and meetings beyond 1 other household.</p><p>-  Consideration of extending the current 5km limit.</p><p>-  Staggered start of easing of other areas of activity with a focus on outdoor activities including sport and some areas of construction.</p><p>Minister Martin and I will continue our engagement with Sport Ireland and the sporting bodies with a view to bringing proposals at the appropriate time for consideration by Government, in consultation with NPHET and the public health authorities. </p></reply>

Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. Hard water and the minerals associated with hard water are not included as parameters in the quality standards specified in the Regulations as they do not pose as a threat to human health. Even though hard water is safe to drink and meets the required drinking water standards, some households may choose to soften their supply but this is a matter of personal choice.</p></reply>

The Board had granted permission in 183 cases to date.</p>  <p>  The status of individual developments which have been granted permission under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, is not routinely maintained by my Department given that some 30,000 planning permissions are granted nationally on an annual basis. My Department has conducted periodic research on the activation rate of SHD permissions and the most recent data, from a review undertaken on 9 February 2021, in this regard would indicate that works have commenced on 52 (28.4%) of the SHD permissions granted as of end January 2021 since the arrangements came into operation. There can be some delay for various reasons, such as phasing of development, in the activation of housing developments post the granting of permission. In this connection, if permissions granted in 2020/ 2021 are excluded from the calculations, the data indicates that works have commenced on 45% of the SHD permissions granted in 2018 (when the first permissions were granted) and 2019.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to not extending the SHD arrangements beyond their legislative expiry date of end December 2021, which has now been extended to 25 February 2022 arising from the Covid-related extension of duration of statutory deadlines within the planning system for 8 weeks in respect of the period March to May 2020. The process for winding up the SHD arrangements and their replacement by possible new arrangements will be considered by my Department over the coming months.</p></reply>

Under its Establishment Order, the LDA may appoint such and so many persons to be employees as it may determine. The LDA reports on its salary and consultancy costs in its annual financial statements in accordance with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. The LDA's 2019 Annual Report, including its financial statements, is published on its website and covers the period from September 2018 to end December 2019. </p>  <p>  In addition, as with all State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department, arrangements have been put in place by the LDA through which Oireachtas members can request information directly from the Agency in relation to operational matters - in this regard, the LDA may be contacted directly at oireachtas@lda.ie.</p>  <p>  In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, on the basis of information provided by the LDA to my Department, I can indicate that the LDA currently has 43 staff, including 3 staff seconded from other State bodies.  It is currently actively recruiting further staff and expects to have 50 staff by the end of 2021. It will have skilled staff in the areas of finance, investment appraisal, investment management, legal, procurement and property development (i.e. quantity surveyors, engineers, planners, architects etc) along with corporate and compliance support roles.  The LDA does not operate a grading system. Contracts are agreed with employees following a competitive hiring process. The LDA spend on salary costs for the period September 2018 to January 2021 is approximately &euro;3.5 million. </p>  <p>  As with any other body responsible for developing large scale projects, the LDA requires professional and technical advisors and these services are tendered for in line with public procurement processes. Public tenders vary in length and do not guarantee any award of services or expenditure until contracts are negotiated. Examples of professional services tendered to date by the LDA include Legal, Architect Lead Design, Project Management, HR, Procurement, Corporate Advisory, Communications.</p>  <p>  To date professional fees incurred by the LDA on projects are predominantly planning and design fees and project management fees as the LDA conducts feasibility and design work on their portfolio of sites. The total spend across sites since September 2018 is in the region of &euro;6 million.  For the same period, corporate professional fees, including procurement fees, communications, recruitment, IT and legal, of approximately &euro;1.7 million have also been paid to date.</p>  <p>  The LDA currently leases office space in Ashford House, Tara Street, Dublin 2. The annual rent is &euro;248,000 (ex VAT) with an annual service  charge of &euro;40,000 (ex VAT).  Limerick City and County Council made accommodation available to one agency employee based in Limerick for a period, for which no rent was paid by the LDA. Due to Covid restrictions, all LDA staff work remotely.</p></reply>

The Report outlines details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities. Data relating to homeless families and their dependants are presented at a regional level.  The Reports are available to access on my Department's website at the following link:  www.gov.ie/en/collection/80ea8-homelessness-data/.</p>  <p>  The most recently published report, in respect of December 2020, confirmed that there were 970 families in emergency accommodation during the survey week. This represents a 37% reduction on the position one year previously and is the lowest number of families in emergency accommodation since March 2016.  </p>  <p>  For families experiencing homelessness, family hubs offer a greater degree of stability than is possible in hotels with access to more appropriate living, storage, cooking and play areas for families.  There are currently 35 operational family hubs nationally, offering more than 760 units of family accommodation in key urban housing authorities. </p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a key priority of this Government. The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing. Subject to the impact of the Covid related restrictions on the construction sector, the available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes.</p></reply>

The Report outlines details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.  Data relating to homeless adults are presented at a county level.  Where fewer that ten individuals are recorded in a county, data are aggregated with an adjacent county, in line with best statistical practice.  The most recent report, for December 2020, records that there were 29 adults utilising emergency accommodation in counties Donegal and Leitrim.  Data on families and dependants are represented on a regional level.  The December 2020 report records that there were 6 families in the North-West Region in emergency accommodation, which combines Counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo.</p>  <p>  The Reports are available to access on my Department's website at the following link:  www.gov.ie/en/collection/80ea8-homelessness-data/.</p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a priority for me and for this Government. The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.  Subject to the impact of the Covid related restrictions on the construction sector, the available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes.</p></reply>

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 73,500 units of social housing stock have been 'shallow' retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;161 million under the scheme.</p>  <p>  A key objective of the Programme for Government is the retrofit of 500,000 homes by 2030 to a B2/Cost Optimal BER standard. It is expected that approximately 36,500 of those will be local authority owned homes. The 2021 Energy Efficiency Programme is a newly revised programme designed around the Programme for Government commitment with a significant increase in funding support of &euro;65 million. &euro;20 million has already been allocated to the Midlands Retrofit Pilot as part of the 'Just Transition' programme leaving a balance available for allocation under the 2021 Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme of &euro;45m. </p>  <p>  Last week I launched the newly revised Programme with an initial allocation to local authorities of &euro;35 million in funding for the retrofitting of 1,293 homes.  The balance of &euro;10m will then be allocated to local authorities who demonstrate an ability to complete the additional work and spend the full allocation in 2021. This Programme will see a significant upscaling, from a &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; to &lsquo;deeper retrofit&rsquo;, on what has been completed by local authorities in previous years and will target 2,400 social homes for upgrade works in 2021, 750 of which relate to the Midlands Retrofit Pilot.</p></reply>

No. 29 of 2021) which will continue in operation until 5 March 2021. These Regulations include "statutory planning system activities, insofar as they cannot be carried out remotely" as an &ldquo;essential service&rdquo; specified at paragraph 14, Part 2 of the Schedule to the Regulations concerning public administration, emergency services and defence. This enables the staff of planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to travel to and from their offices as may be required for the performance of their statutory functions. It also enables such staff to perform related statutory functions including site visits and inspections as well as enforcement activity subject to public health and social distancing requirements. </p>  <p>  In addition, for the purpose of facilitating continued public participation in the planning process during the Level 5 restrictions, regulation 4(1) of the above Regulations provides that an applicable person shall not leave his or her place of residence without reasonable excuse. Regulation 4(2) in this regard provides that such reasonable excuse includes to attend the offices of a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la to engage in a statutory planning process (including making or inspecting a planning application or appeal, making an observation or submission or participating in a Development Plan process) or to inspect a site notice. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it should also be noted in this context that planning authorities are required under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 38) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 180 of 2020) to upload planning applications and related documentation onto their internet websites within 5 working days of receipt or, where exceptional circumstances exist, as soon as practicable thereafter. These measures enable members of the public to view documentation online and at planning offices, and facilitate planning applications, appeals or other submissions to be made during the Level 5 restrictions. These arrangements may include provision for attendance at planning offices by appointment so that public health and social distancing requirements can be observed by both staff and customers. </p>  <p>  I do not envisage that any further actions will be required for the planning system at this time. However, I will continue to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / cohabitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensuring the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his / her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme's operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

These encompass mainstreaming biodiversity into decision making across all sectors; strengthening the knowledge base for the conservation; increasing awareness and appreciation of biodiversity and ecosystem services; conserving and restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services in the wider countryside; the marine environment; expanding and improving management of protected areas and species; and strengthening international governance for biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p>  <p>  The Plan is an all-of-Government document and progress is monitored through the inter-departmental Biodiversity Working Group (BWG) and also by an independent advisory group, the Biodiversity Forum. In 2019, the members of the BWG reported on progress with implementation of relevant actions. On the basis of their submissions, my Department prepared and published an Interim Review in 2020. In late 2020, my Department funded the Biodiversity Forum workshop to report on the progress of the Plan.</p>  <p>  I welcome the report of the Biodiversity Forum and its findings. The report notes that although there has been an increase in public awareness and cross-sectoral engagement in biodiversity, the status of biodiversity in protected areas and beyond is in poor condition and continues to decline. Though not surprising, there are a wide range of reasons for this situation, including long term funding for nature conservation and the way we use our land. The report outlines the strategic approach that is needed to address this biodiversity crisis.  </p>  <p>  There are strong commitments in the Programme for Government for biodiversity, including a commitment to review the remit, status and funding of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), to ensure that it is playing an effective role in delivering its overall mandate and enforcement role in the protection of wildlife. The Programme for Government also commits to providing more funding for local authorities for biodiversity, both in terms of grant funding for actions contained in the NBAP and to ensure that all local authorities have a sufficient number of biodiversity and heritage officers.</p>  <p>  While my team in the NPWS works to develop the successor Plan for 2022-2026, I will consider the report's findings carefully to ensure that the next NBAP is one that delivers real impact. Biodiversity is a whole-of-Government issue and the 2022-2026 Plan, developed in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 and the outcomes of the UN Biodiversity Conference COP15, will reflect that, working with colleagues across Government to improve policy coordination.  </p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  I recently announced a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021 - 2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61m.  Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works etc. were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>  -  Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.)</p>  <p>  -  established Health and Safety needs </p>  <p>  -  state of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.?) and </p>  <p>  -  value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>  This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines, which includes the provision of a new fire station at New Ross and upgrade works to Gorey fire station.  In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that offer best value-for-money and take account of the state of readiness of projects more generally.  </p>  <p>  While a new fire station at Enniscorthy is not included in the current Capital Programme, it is included in a list of projects for inclusion in an annual review. Wexford County Council submitted a preliminary appraisal, with a request for approval-in-principle to proceed to design stage, for a new fire station at Enniscorthy to my Department in October 2020 which is currently under review. My Department will continue to work with Wexford County Council to progress the Enniscorthy fire station project.</p></reply>

The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence. The tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations.  </p><p>A moratorium on evictions taking place is currently in operation throughout the country from 31 December 2020 to 15 March 2021, with limited exceptions. The provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 re-activated on foot of the current 5km restriction on people&rsquo;s movements, initially provided under the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 10) Regulations 2020 - Statutory Instrument (S.I.) No. 701 of 2020 and subsequently, extended under the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 10) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2021 (S.I No. 29 of 2021).  The Minister for Health is empowered to make Regulations to provide for any further extension to the 5km restriction on people's movement, as necessary to strengthen Government efforts to suppress the spread of Covid-19.  If further regulations are made restricting peoples movements to 5km then the protections provided for in the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 will automatically apply. On 23 February, the Government announced that level 5 restrictions will remain in place until 5 April.  Therefore, the moratorium on evictions will be extended to 15 April once regulations, currently being prepared by my colleague the Minister for Health, are made.</p><p>Separately, the provisions of Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 came into effect on 11 January 2021 to provide for temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, that during the period from 11 January to 12 April 2021 a 90 day (rather than the usual 28 days) termination notice period applies, where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and is at risk of losing their tenancy. The earliest termination date allowed in such circumstances is 13 April 2021. Rent increases are prohibited for relevant tenancies until 13 April 2021, with no back-dating allowed. These new protections are designed to better balance the legal rights of landlords and tenants. </p><p>My Department has published a guidance document, Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 - Guidance for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out the new rental protections for tenants and landlords dealing with rent arrears that succeed those provided under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, and provides details on the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords. The guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both tenants and landlords and is available on the RTB's website - <i>www.rtb.ie</i>.</p></reply>

These limits were agreed in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In reviewing the rent limits, my Department worked closely with DSP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly, in the order of 60% in some cases.</p><p>Maximum rent limits for the HAP scheme are set out for each housing authority area by the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017.  The current maximum HAP rent limits are available on the Irish Statute Book website at the following link:</p><p><i>www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/56/made/en/print?q=housing&amp;amp;years=2017. </i></p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case. </p><p>In considering this issue, I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p><p>My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. It is considered that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally adequate to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review and it is a key mechanism in meeting housing need across the Country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-24a.965.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022400075#WRR04200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 to 343, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) was launched in 2018 to support more compact and sustainable development.  The Fund is providing part-funding for projects that will enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and large towns, while also ensuring that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit. </p><p>The URDF is one of four funds established under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has responsibility for its implementation.  The URDF has a total allocation of &euro;2 billion to 2027, with &euro;150 million, inclusive of &euro;84m in capital carryover, available to fund URDF supported projects in 2021. </p><p>In keeping with the aims of the National Planning Framework (NPF) and Project Ireland 2040, the URDF demonstrates a new and more tailored approach to the provision of Government support. Over its planned duration up to 2027, URDF support will be targeted in an integrated, dynamic and responsive way to support the regeneration and rejuvenation of our towns and cities.  </p><p>Already, the URDF is providing assistance for major projects that will contribute to the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan.  </p><p>Applications under Call 1 were open to public bodies and on 26 November 2018, URDF support was announced for a total of 88 projects throughout the country, one of which was later withdrawn by the applicant.  In mid-2019 approval in principle and provisional funding allocations issued in respect of 87 projects across the country. </p><p>Of the 87 proposals approved under Call 1,  46 were in respect of feasibility studies or master planning and 41 were in respect of capital projects of which 24 have commenced  <i>. </i></p><p>This significant pipeline of projects is set to have a transformational impact in urban areas across the country.  Through the URDF, successful applicants are receiving targeted integrated support for innovative holistic solutions to the issues that have hindered the regeneration and rejuvenation of our large towns and cities. To date provisional allocations totalling almost &euro;300m have issued in respect of these projects. </p><p>The programme has been very well received and supported, and while responsibility for the advancement of proposals is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant applicant my Department is working closely with applicants to advance these projects as quickly as possible. </p><p>Call 2 for proposals under the URDF was announced in 2020, with a primary focus on contributing to compact growth objectives through the support of integrated urban developments, strategic development areas combining a number of elements and schemes that support wider climate action objectives and liveability factors within our cities and towns.  Applications under Call 2 were open to local authorities only.  76 proposals were received, with every local authority submitting at least one application. Because of the nature of the URDF programme the proposals are of significant scale and complexity, and each requires detailed assessment.  </p><p>This assessment process is nearing completion, and I intended to soon announce a new tranche of approved URDF supported proposals, which will augment the existing pipeline of projects from Call 1 and contribute to the achievement of Programme for Government commitments and the objectives of the National Planning Framework and Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>The Table below lists the 87 projects approved under Call 1 together with up-to-date provisional URDF funding allocations and details of the payments made to each applicant in respect of their projects in 2019, 2020, and to date in 2021. As the announcement of successful proposals under Call 1 of the URDF was made in late 2018 there was no expenditure on the URDF supported capital programme in that year.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Applicant</th>       <th><div> Project</div></th>       <th>Provisional Allocation<div><br /><br />&euro;

While this legislation does not oblige employers to provide facilities in the workplace to facilitate breastfeeding, comfort rooms are currently available in our buildings at Headquarters that can be used by new mothers for breastfeeding purposes. Dedicated breastfeeding facilities have been included in the design of new Departmental office space in Bishop&rsquo;s Square, Dublin, and consideration is being given to enhancing current facilities across our other buildings.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Strategy 2019-2022 has a focus on gender, equality, diversity and inclusion as one of its four pillars, underscoring the Department&rsquo;s commitment to the development of this agenda. This strategy and our Sub-Committee of the Management Board on Gender, Equality and Diversity takes cognisance of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 when considering policy initiatives and programmes. One of the key actions is to enhance the provision of maternity supports for our female colleagues prior to and on return from maternity leave.</p></reply>

The operation of these Missions is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 as transposed into Irish law by the Diplomatic and Immunities Act 1967.  Privileges and immunities of accredited diplomatic agents in Ireland are governed by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963, as incorporated into Irish law, by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts 1967-2006.</p><p>Article 29 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations provides that a diplomatic agent shall not be liable to any form of arrest or detention, while Article 31 provides that a diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. Diplomatic immunity must be expressly waived for criminal proceedings to commence. </p><p>Road traffic offences allegedly committed by people entitled to diplomatic immunity in Ireland may be brought to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In such cases, the Department reminds resident Diplomatic Missions about their obligations under Article 41.1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which requires all persons enjoying privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State, and informs the concerned Diplomatic Mission of the alleged incident. The number of alleged road traffic offences committed by members of the diplomatic community in Ireland is proportionately low. In general, Diplomatic Missions operate in compliance with Irish law. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, my Department expects all those agents duly accredited here, who are entitled to privileges and immunities in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, to respect Irish laws and regulations, as indeed, we expect our Embassies abroad to respect the laws and regulations of the host country. I recall that the purpose of diplomatic privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the effective performance of the functions of Diplomatic Missions. In addition, Article 31(4) of the Vienna Convention provides that the immunity of a diplomatic agent from the jurisdiction of the receiving State does not exempt the agent from the jurisdiction of the sending State.</p><p>The tables below have been compiled from electronic records held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and relate to alleged incidents brought to the attention of the Department by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: </p><p>(i)  the number of alleged road traffic offences in each year from 2010 &ndash; 2020;</p><p>(ii) the number of alleged road traffic offences for each Diplomatic Mission from 2010 &ndash; 2020.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>No. of alleged Road Traffic Offences</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>No. of alleged Road Traffic Offences</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>2020 </td>        <td>9 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Diplomatic Mission</th>       <th>No. of alleged Road Traffic Offences 2010 - 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Russia </td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Egypt </td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Saudi Arabia</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bulgaria </td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Georgia </td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Czech Republic</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Hungary </td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Iran </td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nigeria </td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Palestinian Mission</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>China </td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Croatia </td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Korea (Rep. of)</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Latvia </td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Slovakia </td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>United Arab Emirates</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Austria </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Brazil </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cyprus </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Estonia </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ethiopia </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Greece </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Malaysia </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mexico </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Portugal </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ukraine </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Chile </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Germany </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>India </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Israel </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Morocco </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Netherlands </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pakistan </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Philippines </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Romania </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Slovenia </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Africa</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Turkey </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>United States of America</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The work underway across my Department complements wider efforts towards gender equality being advanced through the Civil Service renewal process. <table>    <tr>       <th>Grade</th>       <th>Total </th>       <th>Female</th>       <th>Male</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secretary General</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Second Secretary</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deputy Secretary</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Secretary</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Adviser</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Counsellor</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>53</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deputy Legal Adviser </td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Principal Development Specialist</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Principal Officer</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Senior Development Specialist</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Legal Adviser</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Principal</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Architect (AP)</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Development Specialist</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>First Secretary</td>       <td>170</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>89</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Accountant</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Quantity Surveyor</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Senior Architect</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Administrative Officer</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Archivist (AO)</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Third Secretary</td>       <td>155</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>69</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Higher Executive Officer</td>       <td>118</td>       <td>68</td>       <td>50</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Executive Officer</td>       <td>226</td>       <td>143</td>       <td>83</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clerical Officer</td>       <td>569</td>       <td>392</td>       <td>177</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Adviser</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Civilian Driver</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Services Officer</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>33</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cleaner</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TCO</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>1603</td>       <td>923</td>       <td>680</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Irish students will, however, be treated on the same basis as UK students from outside Scotland.  </p>  <p>  This means that Irish undergraduate students living in the UK or Ireland will be liable for fees of up to &pound;9,250 per annum for courses at Scottish higher education institutions, beginning later this year. In light of this, and with a view to mitigating the negative impacts of this change, Scotland has however set aside a residency requirement, which will allow Irish students to access its student loan system. It is important to note that these new arrangements will not impact on Irish students who have already commenced their studies at higher education institutions in Scotland.  </p>  <p>  Under the Common Travel Area, Irish and British citizens are afforded the right to access all levels of education and training, and associated student support, in each other's State, on terms no less favourable than those for the citizens of that State. I recognise in this context that Irish citizens will be treated no less favourably than British citizens, resident outside Scotland, for the purposes of student fees in Scotland. Notwithstanding that, I regret the introduction of the policy, which may impact on student mobility.  </p>  <p>  I - and officials in my Department - work on an on-going basis with the British Government to ensure the smooth operation of Common Travel Area and its associated rights and privileges. This work is mirrored across Government Departments, and each sectoral area.  </p>  <p>  Both the Minister for Further and Higher Education and I have spoken with our Scottish counterparts on several occasions in relation to the new fee arrangements for Irish students. We are also looking ahead and have discussed how best to develop future co-operation between Ireland and Scotland in the areas of further and higher education and research.</p>  <p>  The Ireland-Scotland Joint Bilateral Review Report 2021-25, which I launched with the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for External Affairs in January, is focused on developing the Ireland-Scotland relationship in the round in the coming years. Importantly, the Review Report contains a recommendation for Irish and Scottish officials to establish a framework for education cooperation, including by finding ways to encourage student mobility.  </p></reply>

Immigration issues have been raised on an ongoing basis in our engagement with US Administrations and political leaders. This will continue as we maintain close relations with Members of Congress and contacts from across the political spectrum, and as we seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with the new Administration of President Joe Biden.</p>  <p>  We are pleased to see that immigration issues, including possible pathways to citizenship, are a priority for the new US President, as demonstrated by the proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021. We look forward to working with the new Administration, as well as with the new US Congress, across the aisle, to pursue comprehensive immigration reform in the US. We will actively engage with the new Administration and Congress on this, including through our Embassy in Washington DC.</p>  <p>  We also continue to pursue the E3 Visa Bill, which, if passed, could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities to live and work in the US. Our Embassy in Washington D.C. continues its extensive outreach in support of the Bill, working with a range of Members of the US House of Representatives and the Senate. Now that the new Administration and new Congress are in place, we will seek the reintroduction of the Bill at the earliest opportunity. </p></reply>

These issues have been discussed in a series of virtual meetings which I have had with EU and European counterparts recently while they also arose at the virtual meeting of the General Affairs Council which Minister Byrne attended on 23 February.</p>  <p>  Discussions regarding a coordinated approach to travel within the EU took place within the General Affairs Council last autumn culminating in the adoption of Council Recommendation 2020/1475 establishing the EU traffic light system for travel in October 2020. The Council Recommendation was further updated earlier this year in order to allow greater discretion to Member States to impose tougher restrictions, if warranted by the epidemiological situation in their country. A number of Member States including Ireland have in recent weeks temporarily departed from the traffic light system for travel in response to the emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus. It is hoped that once the epidemiological situation improves both in Ireland and across the EU that the traffic light system for travel can once again be fully implemented by the majority of Member States in order to facilitate freedom of movement and travel within the EU and across the continent generally. </p>  <p>  Over the last number of months, a number of Member States have also raised the issue of &lsquo;vaccine certificates&rsquo; and suggested they could be used, amongst other things, to facilitate greater ease of travel in the EU once restrictions are lifted in Member States. The EU has since published guidelines in relation to covid vaccination certificates but these guidelines limit their proposed use to medical use only, rather than for travel.  </p>  <p>  It is important to differentiate vaccine certificates, which are used to identify and monitor those who have been vaccinated, and an immunity passport which may allow an exemption from public health measures on the basis that the person has purported immunity to COVID-19. The WHO has cautioned Governments against introducing immunity passports at this time and has advised that the focus should remain on vaccine certificates as a medical record.</p>  <p>  With regard to the use of digital vaccination certificates for travel &ndash; or vaccine passports, whilst various technical solutions are being considered in case they are required, no policy position has yet been developed to determine whether they will be used or for what purposes.</p></reply>

The EDP builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that the Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. </p>  <p>  The cost of the contract including ancillary support is &euro;222.1m inclusive of VAT. Stage payments totalling &euro;116.8m inclusive of VAT have been paid to date. The project is progressing well. </p>  <p>  This significant investment in maritime patrol aircraft is an example which demonstrates my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.  Investment under the National Development Plan (NDP) continues to increase.  Budget 2021 provides for a further increased gross NDP allocation to &euro;131m in the defence capital budget in respect of equipment and barracks infrastructure.  This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

The 2015 White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF. </p>  <p>  The White Paper acknowledges that there may be professional skills that on occasion may not be readily available in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) and outlines an intention to harness specialist skills that members of the Reserve may have to better support the PDF. </p>  <p>  A Skills Survey of the RDF has been undertaken by the Defence Forces which provides an overview of the range of skills available within the Reserve. The Skills Survey was conducted from February to April 2015 and throughout October 2016. The target population was all active members of the RDF who reported for training during the two survey periods, both Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve. A total of 874 responses were received, 700 in 2015 and a further 174 in 2016, which correlated to 67% of the target population. </p>  <p>  A Workforce Planning project is underway which will identify skills gaps in the PDF and identify appropriate measures to address any such gaps. The skills survey undertaken of the RDF will assist in identifying possible options to address gaps.  Options to underpin the engagement of RDF members will be identified as the various stages of this work unfold. </p>  <p>  The work of the Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, established in line with the Programme for Government 2020, encompasses the role and contribution of the RDF, including its legislation; the regulations governing the RDF, the development of the First Line Reserve (FLR) and whether specialists from the RDF should be able to serve overseas.</p></reply>

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020/2021 academic year. </p><p>My Department has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021. </p><p>These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020. It will also ensure that any final year students have the opportunity to graduate as scheduled in summer 2021. </p><p>Budget 2020 provided for the re-instatement of the grant to cover the full cost of the Gaeltacht Learning Periods (GLPs) for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary ITE programmes, with effect from the 2020/2021 academic year.  The grant was previously funded by my Department up to the 2012/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints.  The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650.  This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements. </p><p>In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of <i>Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge</i>which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. </p><p>It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme.  HEIs are currently working directly with their Gaeltacht College providers on implementing the practical and administrative arrangements for delivery of the GLP.</p><p>An allowance has been made for 2<sup>nd</sup>year Professional Masters in Education (PME) students (including students in the College referred to by the Deputy). Those 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have not completed any GLP will now complete a 3 week online programme (had previously been required to complete 4 weeks). 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have completed some of their required GLP will now be required to complete the remaining balance (up to a total requirement of 3 weeks) online. This particular allowance, approved by the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Education Committee, recognised the significant timetabling issues facing 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students in respect of school placement, the GLP and normal course work.<i></i></p><p>The College referred to by the Deputy is an independent private provider of ITE programmes. In relation to the cost of the online programme for students in the College referred to by the Deputy, my Department has recently responded to a proposal from that College confirming that both my Department and the Teaching Council has no issue with that College, working in collaboration with a Gaeltacht College(s) to provide an online programme based on the agreed syllabus for their own students and to negotiate and set the cost for undertaking that programme for their own students.</p></reply>

Public health remain of the view that schools are low risk environments and that the infection prevention and control measures in place in school are effective but recognise there is an ongoing need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at this time. </p>  <p>  The CMO has made it very clear in his advices to Government which are published on gov.ie, that schools are safe environments, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections of children and adolescents occurs outside the school setting. The decision to delay the reopening of schools was in recognition of the need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at a time where there was unprecedented levels of disease transmission in the community. This was not based on a changed assessment of the risks in relation to transmission levels in schools. </p>  <p>  Public Health have also stated that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. Schools have been supported by a funding package of almost &euro;650 m to put in place and maintain these key infection control measures. Public Health advice is that compliance with these measures ensure that schools remain safe places for children and staff.</p>  <p>  The vaccine protocol devised by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC), is endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and signed up to by Government. The Department of Health have confirmed that those essential to Education are estimated at this time to be in the first one third of the population captured by the Vaccine Allocation Strategy. My Department has further engaged with the Department of Health requesting that consideration is given to school community as the vaccination programme is rolled out in order to accommodate front line school staff within the vaccination programme at the earliest possible opportunity. </p>  <p>  My Department has developed a plan with the relevant education stakeholders for the phased return to in-school learning for children in primary, post-primary and special schools.  From the 1 March the first four classes at primary level &ndash; junior and senior infants, first and second class &ndash; and final year Leaving Certificate students will return to school.  This phase will also see a return to full attendance for children in special schools. This is in addition to the reopening of special schools on 11 February on a 50% attendance basis and all special classes reopened fully from 22 February. </p>  <p>  The full re-opening of our schools for all students in line with public health advice remains a top priority for Government and my Department is focussing on the safe return of all remaining cohorts of pupils and students to school at the earliest opportunity in March, with the last group of post primary students set to return to school after the Easter Break. </p></reply>

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020/2021 academic year. </p><p>My Department has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021.</p><p>These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020. It will also ensure that any final year students have the opportunity to graduate as scheduled in summer 2021.  </p><p>Budget 2020 provided for the re-instatement of the grant to cover the full cost of the Gaeltacht Learning Periods (GLPs) for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary ITE programmes, with effect from the 2020/2021 academic year.  The grant was previously funded by my Department up to the 2012/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints.  The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650.  This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements. </p><p>In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of <i>Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge</i>which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. </p><p>It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme.  HEIs are currently working directly with their Gaeltacht College providers on implementing the practical and administrative arrangements for delivery of the GLP.</p><p>An allowance has been made for 2<sup>nd</sup>year Professional Masters in Education (PME) students (including students in the College referred to by the Deputy). Those 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have not completed any GLP will now complete a 3 week online programme (had previously been required to complete 4 weeks). 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have completed some of their required GLP will now be required to complete the remaining balance (up to a total requirement of 3 weeks) online. This particular allowance, approved by the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Education Committee, recognised the significant timetabling issues facing 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students in respect of school placement, the GLP and normal course work.</p><p>The College referred to by the Deputy is an independent private provider of ITE programmes. In relation to the cost of the online programme for students in the College referred to by the Deputy, my Department has recently responded to a proposal from that College confirming that both my Department and the Teaching Council has no issue with that College, working in collaboration with a Gaeltacht College(s) to provide an online programme based on the agreed syllabus for their own students and to negotiate and set the cost for undertaking that programme for their own students.</p></reply>

The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the need for training.</p>  <p>  A new national training programme for SNAs currently employed in recognised schools was developed on foot of the Review's recommendations. Following a public procurement process, University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, were selected to develop and deliver this important educational initiative. UCD&rsquo;s wide-ranging experience and expertise will enable the delivery of a broad-ranging and high-quality programme. This programme began in January 2021 with 500 participants in the first year. Priority was given to SNAs working in School Inclusion Pilot Schools. In total, there are 3,500 places available on the programme over the next four years.</p>  <p>  This major educational initiative will enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. For some SNAs, this programme may present the first opportunity in recent times for them to engage with the theory and research based best practice underlying their role. Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education. </p>  <p>  There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education and Skills. Participation in the programme is voluntary and all available places in this phase have been taken up.</p></reply>

The research captured a range of perspectives, including those of principals, teachers, parents and students.  It involved surveys of different stakeholders, discussion with school principals and focus groups of students.  The analysis indicates that overall during the September-December period, schools operated safely, students settled in well to school and teachers successfully adapted their teaching approaches in response to COVID-19 arrangements. Reports on the different strands of the research will be published shortly.  </p>  <p>  The Inspectorate also continues to monitor provision for remote teaching and learning during the current period of school closure in a number of ways, including telephone surveys of principals and surveys of parents and students.

While SNAs are very much valued in the provision of care support, the Review recommended that a more broadly based set of supports was required including therapeutic supports.  </p>  <p>  The Review also referenced SNA training. Among the recommendations was the introduction of a national training programme for SNAs currently employed in our schools. Following a public procurement process, University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, were selected to develop and deliver this important educational initiative. UCD&rsquo;s wide-ranging experience and expertise will enable the delivery of a broad-ranging and high-quality programme. </p>  <p>  This major educational initiative will enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.

Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education.  </p>  <p>  There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools.

Public health remain of the view that schools are low risk environments and that the infection prevention and control measures in place in school are effective but recognise there is an ongoing need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at this time. </p>  <p>  The CMO has made it very clear in his advices to Government which are published on gov.ie, that schools are safe environments, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections of children and adolescents occurs outside the school setting. The decision to delay the reopening of schools was in recognition of the need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at a time where there was unprecedented levels of disease transmission in the community. This was not based on a changed assessment of the risks in relation to transmission levels in schools. </p>  <p>  Schools have put significant infection prevention control measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to/within the school and significant funding of almost &euro;650 million has been put in place by my Department to fund Covid-19 related measures, including funding for PPE, sanitation and additional cleaning etc.  </p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of covid-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the infection control measures promoted by HPSC.</p>  <p>  The HPSC advice advises that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, through regular hand washing, etc. </p>  <p>  My Department has developed a plan with the relevant education stakeholders for the phased return to in-school learning for children in primary, post-primary and special schools.

Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8kms at post-primary and are attending their nearest School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and will be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. </p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; </p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:</p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. </p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

I am particularly conscious of the impact that school closures have on children with special needs.</p><p>I am particularity conscious of the impact school closures have on  children with special educational needs.  </p><p>Building on the return to school in recent weeks of children in special schools and in special classes at primary and post-primary level, the Government has decided on a phased return of students to in-school education.</p><p>These further phases have been developed in close collaboration with education stakeholders and follow ongoing engagement with the Department of Health and Public Health, HSE. </p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE have reaffirmed that schools in themselves are low risk environments and that a gradual phased reopening can occur at this time. Public health has reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools and is satisfied that these infection prevention and control measures, if rigorously adhered to, will keep the school community safe during this period. They emphasise that all measures must be followed carefully by students, staff and parents.</p><p>There will be a period of time between each phase to assess the impact of reopening on aspects of community transmission.</p><p>The phased return of students to in-school education and the associated target dates are as follows </p><p><b>-  Monday 1 March</b>- the first four class groups at primary level &ndash; junior and senior infants, first and second class &ndash; and final year Leaving Certificate students will return to in-school provision. This phase will also see a return to full attendance for children in special schools, as well as children in early start pre-school classes and early intervention special classes for children with autism or hearing impairment. </p><p><b>-  Monday 15 March</b>- the return to in-school provision of the rest of primary school children &ndash; third to sixth class, and fifth year Leaving Certificate students. This date will be reviewed during the period following 1 March. </p><p><b>-  Monday 12 April - </b>the return to in-school education of the rest of post-primary students following the Easter &ndash; i.e. first to fourth year students.</p><p>My Department is anxious to further support those pupils/students with SEN who are unable to return to in-school teaching and learning under these phases.</p><p>At Primary level in recognition that not all primary pupils with special education needs will be back in school in this phase</p><p>-  Schools have been asked to prioritise deployment of their SET resources to facilitate the engagement of those pupils with SEN who are in 3rd to 6th class. This will necessitate further collaboration between the SETs and class teachers to establish current priority learning needs among those pupils.  </p><p>-  The supplementary programme for eligible pupils who are in 3rd to 6th class will be extended by a further two weeks </p><p>At Post Primary level in recognition that not all students with special education needs will be back in school in this phase </p><p>-  The supplementary programme for eligible students who have not yet returned to school will be extended by a further two weeks. </p><p>The supplementary programme is intended to supplement the teaching and learning provided by the student&rsquo;s school and alleviate the impact of this period of school closure through the provision of 5 hours per week in-person teaching or care support to be delivered in homes. </p><p>The programme must be delivered outside of the normal school day (i.e. evenings and weekends), so that the student can continue to engage as fully as possible with the teaching and learning provided by their school. </p><p>Any unused hours can be delivered to families at any time before 30 April 2021, including during the Easter holidays. </p><p>My Department has been contacted by schools and families who wish to access the supplementary programme in school settings. My Department is willing to engage with the education stakeholders, particularly the school management bodies on the logistical issues which may need to be considered in the running of this programme in school premises, particularly as this programme is intended to happen outside of school hours such as evenings and weekends. </p><p>I know that a phased re-opening is particularly challenging for many children with special educational needs who have not yet returned to school and their families.</p><p>The purpose of managing this cautious phased return is to continue to limit the mobility of the population and curb the spread of the virus.</p><p>The safe return and sustained safe re-opening of our schools is a key priority for Government. </p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each local authority to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.

The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  </p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been in operation under my Department since 2018 and provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.  (Previously, applicant patrons were required to collect parental preferences directly from parents and submit these with their application to the Department.) </p>  <p>  A prospective patron can chose the school(s) it wishes to apply for and complete an application form in that regard for each school, for submission to my Department.  The Department provides details on the OPPS of the school(s) and the list of applicant patrons which have applied for patronage of the school(s).  Parents can then access the OPPS website, which allows them to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction (with the exception of the Irish-medium primary Gaelscoileanna which have been designated as Irish-medium prior to the opening of the OPPS - in the case of these schools, parents can select their preferred patron).  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.</p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

It has been confirmed that the wearing of masks by primary school students is not being recommended at this time</p>  <p>  Public Health has consistently advised that schools are safe places for both students and staff because of the mitigation measures in place in our schools. Public Health have also stated that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. Schools have been supported by a funding package of almost &euro;650m to put in place and maintain these key infection control measures.

The total education spend will be approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p><p>Most children with special educational needs are enrolled and supported in mainstream classes and data is not collected on the numbers.  The thrust of Department policy in recent times is to allocate special education teachers based on an education profile of the school so a diagnosis of need is not required in respect of children accessing this support. In relation to the Dublin City school planning area referenced by the Deputy, I am advised by the NCSE that there are currently 8 special schools and 53<b></b>special classes providing special education placements for 469 students at primary and post primary level. </p><p>Through ongoing consultation at local level the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work at local level to identify any and all relevant suitable placements. </p><p>Special classes in the Dublin area generally operate at capacity, and the NCSE is working with a significant number of schools in the county to encourage and support the opening of new ASD classes at all levels. </p><p>I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. </p><p>Further information on special schools, special classes and contact details for SENOs is available at www.ncse.ie. </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources (teachers) provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location. For the current school year (2020/21), it operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1) which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. </p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; </p><p>-  an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>-  consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>-  the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>-  an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:</p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. </p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

I am particularly conscious of the impact that school closures have on children with special needs.</p><p>I am particularity conscious of the impact school closures have on  children with special educational needs. </p><p>Building on the return to school in recent weeks of children in special schools and in special classes at primary and post-primary level, the Government has decided on a phased return of students to in-school education.</p><p>These further phases have been developed in close collaboration with education stakeholders and follow ongoing engagement with the Department of Health and Public Health, HSE. </p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE have reaffirmed that schools in themselves are low risk environments and that a gradual phased reopening can occur at this time. Public health has reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools and is satisfied that these infection prevention and control measures, if rigorously adhered to, will keep the school community safe during this period. They emphasise that all measures must be followed carefully by students, staff and parents.</p><p>There will be a period of time between each phase to assess the impact of reopening on aspects of community transmission.</p><p>The phased return of students to in-school education and the associated target dates are as follows</p><p><b>-  Monday 1 March</b>- the first four class groups at primary level &ndash; junior and senior infants, first and second class &ndash; and final year Leaving Certificate students will return to in-school provision. This phase will also see a return to full attendance for children in special schools, as well as children in early start pre-school classes and early intervention special classes for children with autism or hearing impairment. </p><p><b>-Monday 15 March</b>- the return to in-school provision of the rest of primary school children &ndash; third to sixth class, and fifth year Leaving Certificate students. This date will be reviewed during the period following 1 March. </p><p><b>-  Monday 12 April - </b>the return to in-school education of the rest of post-primary students following the Easter &ndash; i.e. first to fourth year students.</p><p>My Department is anxious to further support those pupils/students with SEN who are unable to return to in-school teaching and learning under these phases.</p><p>At Primary level in recognition that not all students with special education needs will be back in school in this phase </p><p>-  Schools have been asked to prioritise deployment of their SET resources to facilitate the engagement of those pupils with SEN who are in 3rd to 6th class. This will necessitate further collaboration between the SETs and class teachers to establish current priority learning needs among those pupils.  </p><p>-  The supplementary programme for eligible pupils who are in 3rd to 6th class will be extended by a further two weeks </p><p>At Post Primary level in recognition that not students with special education needs will be back in school in this phase </p><p>-  The supplementary programme for eligible students who have not yet returned to school will be extended by a further two weeks.</p><p>The supplementary programme is intended to supplement the teaching and learning provided by the student&rsquo;s school and alleviate the impact of this period of school closure through the provision of 5 hours per week in-person teaching or care support to be delivered in homes. </p><p>The programme must be delivered outside of the normal school day (i.e. evenings and weekends), so that the student can continue to engage as fully as possible with the teaching and learning provided by their school. </p><p>Any unused hours can be delivered to families at any time before 30 April 2021, including during the Easter holidays. </p><p>My Department has been contacted by schools and families who wish to access the supplementary programme in school settings. My Department is willing to engage with the education stakeholders, particularly the school management bodies on the logistical issues which may need to be considered in the running of this programme in school premises, particularly as this programme is intended to happen outside of school hours such as evenings and weekends. </p><p>I know that a phased re-opening is particularly challenging for many children with special educational needs who have not yet returned to school and their families.</p><p>The purpose of managing this cautious phased return is to continue to limit the mobility of the population and curb the spread of the virus.</p><p>The safe return and sustained safe re-opening of our schools is a key priority for Government. </p></reply>

This involves all teachers who are medically fit to work, including SETs, providing remote teaching and learning to all pupils in their class or on their caseload. </p>  <p>  It is crucially important that the learning of all pupils/students, especially those with special educational needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage and/or early school leaving, are supported at this time.  These supports include teachers engaging with their pupils/students on a regular basis, through a blend of guided and independent learnings tasks and experiences.  Chosen learning tasks provide an opportunity to demonstrate a student&rsquo;s learning in a clear and concise way.  These learning tasks enable teachers to monitor progress and provide constructive, developmental feedback to support learning.</p>  <p>  Where possible it is important that pupils move on with their peers and continue on to the next stage of their education.  When pupils have started back in school, the principal and teachers can assess their needs and adapt their teaching programme so that any gaps in their learning resulting from the temporary closure of schools can be addressed. For the vast majority of pupils, this will ensure progression is as seamless a manner as possible.</p>  <p>  In exceptional circumstances a school may conclude a pupil or student would benefit educationally by repeating a grade level having first consulted with the learning support teacher/resource teacher and class teacher and parents. In such circumstances there should be a clear programme outlined for such a pupil that records precisely what new approach will be used for her/him and what its expected benefit will be. These records should be retained within the school and should be brought to the attention of a Department Inspectorate, by the Principal on visiting the school.</p></reply>

As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p>  <p>  Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, my Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above the SEC has advised schools of the flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework. Details of revised schedules for these components will be issued to schools shortly.  </p>  <p>  Putting in place both the examinations and a corresponding measure of SEC-Accredited Grades is essential to ensuring a fair system, having regard to the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students due to the interruption of in-person teaching and learning during the periods of school closure.</p></reply>

The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  A whole-school team approach to planning is recommended in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response is aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  </p><p>NEPS has created a range of resources and support including Wellbeing Webinars for primary/special/post-primary schools, Wellbeing Toolkits for Schools with a range of easily downloadable, user-friendly materials and  advice and resources for parents,  student and school staff to support their wellbeing at this time.  Resources include:  </p><p>Students</p><p>-  Advice for young people while schools are closed</p><p>-  A Plan for the Day &ndash; A template to support daily routines</p><p>-  Managing Stress and Anxiety &ndash; a guide for students</p><p>-  Panic attacks &ndash; a guide for students</p><p>Teachers</p><p>-  The response to stress information for school staff</p><p>-  Normalising thoughts feelings and behaviour &ndash; a guide for school staff</p><p>-  Guidelines for Teachers - Listen, Connect, Model &amp;amp; Teach (This guide has been developed to enable teachers  to talk in a comforting and supportive way with students who may need the support of the Student Support Team at this time</p><p>-  Managing Stress and Anxiety in students &ndash; A Guide for School Staff</p><p>Parents</p><p>-  A Guide for Parents on supporting children and young people with daily routines while schools are closed</p><p>-  How to Calm and Support your Child &ndash; A Guide for Parents and Guardians</p><p>-  Managing Stress and Anxiety - A Guide for Parents and Guardians</p><p>These resources can be accessed on the gov.ie website.  </p><p>NEPS psychologists continue to provide a service to schools via remote access.  All psychologists have been asked to continue to maintain contact with their assigned schools during this period of school closure.  NEPS psychologists will continue to provide those elements of case work that can be managed remotely to support the learning and wellbeing of children and young people during this current period of school closure. With the support of schools, this may include consultation with teachers and/or teachers and parents, input into Student Support Plans/Reviews and feedback to teachers and/or parents. NEPS will also continue to provide support to schools in the event of a critical incident.  </p><p>In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist will identify the most appropriate referral pathway and support schools with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  </p><p>At post primary level, each school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, which is calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  Counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  </p><p>As part of the resources announced to support schools 17 additional NEPS psychologists were sanctioned to provide enhanced services to support the wellbeing of our school communities at this time and 120 additional posts have been provided for guidance counselling in post primary schools.</p><p>Overall responsibility for the provision of child and adolescent mental health services lies within the remit of the Department of Health. My Department will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded e-mental health services. The Department of Health and HSE have ensured the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for young people. The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice.  These include the Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me, Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.</p></reply>

My Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within the particular area and its ability to meet increased demand.  </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: </p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review and work on an updated exercise to assess needs for the coming years is at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.   </p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been in operation under my Department since 2018 and provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.  (Previously, applicant patrons were required to collect parental preferences directly from parents and submit these with their application to the Department.)  </p>  <p>  A prospective patron can chose the school(s) it wishes to apply for and complete an application form in that regard for each school, for submission to my Department.  The Department provides details on the OPPS of the school(s) and the list of applicant patrons which have applied for patronage of the school(s).  Parents can then access the OPPS website, which allows them to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction (with the exception of the Irish-medium primary Gaelscoileanna which have been designated as Irish-medium prior to the opening of the OPPS - in the case of these schools, parents can select their preferred patron).  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process. </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Public health remain of the view that schools are low risk environments and that the infection prevention and control measures in place in school are effective but recognise there is an ongoing need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at this time. </p>  <p>  The CMO has made it very clear in his advices to Government which are published on gov.ie, that schools are safe environments, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections of children and adolescents occurs outside the school setting. The decision to delay the reopening of schools was in recognition of the need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at a time where there was unprecedented levels of disease transmission in the community. This was not based on a changed assessment of the risks in relation to transmission levels in schools. </p>  <p>  Intensive engagement and input from education partners representing parents, students, unions, management bodies and principal networks on the plans for the phased reopening of schools has been ongoing. The voice of students is represented in those ongoing engagements by the Irish Second-Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU). </p>  <p>  My Department has developed a plan with the relevant education stakeholders for the phased return to in-school learning for children in primary, post-primary and special schools.  From the 1 March the first four classes at primary level &ndash; junior and senior infants, first and second class &ndash; and final year Leaving Certificate students will return to school.  This phase will also see a return to full attendance for children in special schools. This is in addition to the reopening of special schools on 11 February on a 50% attendance basis and all special classes reopened fully from 22 February. </p>  <p>  The full re-opening of our schools for all students in line with public health advice remains a top priority for Government and my Department is focussing on the safe return of all remaining cohorts of pupils and students to school at the earliest opportunity in March, with the last group of post primary students set to return to school after the Easter Break. </p></reply>

I am particularly conscious of the impact that school closures have on children with special needs.</p><p>I am particularity conscious of the impact school closures have on  children with special educational needs.</p><p>Building on the return to school in recent weeks of children in special schools and in special classes at primary and post-primary level, the Government has decided on a phased return of students to in-school education.</p><p>These further phases have been developed in close collaboration with education stakeholders and follow ongoing engagement with the Department of Health and Public Health, HSE.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE have reaffirmed that schools in themselves are low risk environments and that a gradual phased reopening can occur at this time. Public health has reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools and is satisfied that these infection prevention and control measures, if rigorously adhered to, will keep the school community safe during this period. They emphasise that all measures must be followed carefully by students, staff and parents.</p><p>There will be a period of time between each phase to assess the impact of reopening on aspects of community transmission.</p><p>The phased return of students to in-school education and the associated target dates are as follows:</p><p><b>Monday, 1 March</b></p><p>the first four class groups at primary level &ndash; junior and senior infants, first and second class &ndash; and final year Leaving Certificate students will return to in-school provision. This phase will also see a return to full attendance for children in special schools, as well as children in early start pre-school classes and early intervention special classes for children with autism or hearing impairment.</p><p><b>Monday, 15 March</b></p><p>the return to in-school provision of the rest of primary school children &ndash; third to sixth class, and fifth year Leaving Certificate students. This date will be reviewed during the period following 1 March.</p><p><b>Monday, 12 April</b></p><p>the return to in-school education of the rest of post-primary students following the Easter &ndash; i.e. first to fourth year students.</p><p>My Department is anxious to further support those pupils/students with SEN who are unable to return to in-school teaching and learning under these phases.</p><p>At Primary level in recognition that not all primary pupils with special education needs will be back in school in this phase:</p><p>- Schools have been asked to prioritise deployment of their SET resources to facilitate the engagement of those pupils with SEN who are in 3rd to 6th class. This will necessitate further collaboration between the SETs and class teachers to establish current priority learning needs among those pupils.</p><p>- The supplementary programme for eligible pupils who are in 3rd to 6th class will be extended by a further two weeks.</p><p>At Post Primary level in recognition that not all students with special education needs will be back in school in this phase:</p><p>- The supplementary programme for eligible students who have not yet returned to school will be extended by a further two weeks.</p><p>I know that a phased re-opening is particularly challenging for many children with special educational needs who have not yet returned to school and their families.</p><p>The purpose of managing this cautious phased return is to continue to limit the mobility of the population and curb the spread of the virus.</p><p>The safe return and sustained safe re-opening of our schools is a key priority for Government.</p></reply>

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.</p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school.</p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.</p><p>There are currently 36 special classes providing placements for students in Dublin 5, 13 and 17 at Primary and Post Primary level. I can assure the Deputy that where schools notify NCSE of vacancies within their specialist provision, SENOs work locally to ensure parents are made aware of these special class places.</p><p>Through ongoing consultation at local level, the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements.</p><p>Special classes in the Dublin area generally operate at capacity. The data available to NCSE suggests that additional special class placements are required in the Dublin 5, 13 and 17 postal areas and as a result NCSE is engaging with every local primary and post primary school to create additional placements and to identify the supports/building requirements a school may require. The NCSE have specific plans in place to open a number of additional classes in schools in the postal codes areas referenced by the Deputy and in North Dublin generally.</p><p>The NCSE's local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: . Information on the list of schools with special classes is available at www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020/2021 academic year.</p>  <p>  My Department has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021.</p>  <p>  These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020. It will also ensure that any final year students have the opportunity to graduate as scheduled in summer 2021.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for the re-instatement of the grant to cover the full cost of the Gaeltacht Learning Periods (GLPs) for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary ITE programmes, with effect from the 2020/2021 academic year.  The grant was previously funded by my Department up to the 2012/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints. The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650. This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements.</p>  <p>  In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p>  <p>  It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme. HEIs are currently working directly with their Gaeltacht College providers on implementing the practical and administrative arrangements for delivery of the GLP.</p>  <p>  An allowance has been made for 2nd year Professional Masters in Education (PME) students (including students in the College referred to by the Deputy). Those 2nd year PME students who have not completed any GLP will now complete a 3 week online programme (had previously been required to complete 4 weeks). 2nd year PME students who have completed some of their required GLP will now be required to complete the remaining balance (up to a total requirement of 3 weeks) online. This particular allowance, approved by the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Education Committee, recognised the significant timetabling issues facing 2nd year PME students in respect of school placement, the GLP and normal course work.</p>  <p>  The College referred to by the Deputy is an independent private provider of ITE programmes. In relation to the cost of the online programme for students in the College referred to by the Deputy, my Department has recently responded to a proposal from that College confirming that both my Department and the Teaching Council has no issue with that College, working in collaboration with a Gaeltacht College(s) to provide an online programme based on the agreed syllabus for their own students and to negotiate and set the cost for undertaking that programme for their own students.</p></reply>

This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements.</p>  <p>  In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p>  <p>  It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme.

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020/2021 academic year. </p><p>My Department has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021. </p><p>These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020. It will also ensure that any final year students have the opportunity to graduate as scheduled in summer 2021.  </p><p>Budget 2020 provided for the re-instatement of the grant to cover the full cost of the Gaeltacht Learning Periods (GLPs) for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary ITE programmes, with effect from the 2020/2021 academic year.  The grant was previously funded by my Department up to the 2012/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints.  The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650.  This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements. </p><p>In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of <i>Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge</i>which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. </p><p>It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme.  HEIs are currently working directly with their Gaeltacht College providers on implementing the practical and administrative arrangements for delivery of the GLP.</p><p>An allowance has been made for 2<sup>nd</sup>year Professional Masters in Education (PME) students (including students in the College referred to by the Deputy). Those 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have not completed any GLP will now complete a 3 week online programme (had previously been required to complete 4 weeks). 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have completed some of their required GLP will now be required to complete the remaining balance (up to a total requirement of 3 weeks) online. This particular allowance, approved by the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Education Committee, recognised the significant timetabling issues facing 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students in respect of school placement, the GLP and normal course work.  <i></i></p><p>The College referred to by the Deputy is an independent private provider of ITE programmes. In relation to the cost of the online programme for students in the College referred to by the Deputy, my Department has recently responded to a proposal from that College confirming that both my Department and the Teaching Council has no issue with that College, working in collaboration with a Gaeltacht College(s) to provide an online programme based on the agreed syllabus for their own students and to negotiate and set the cost for undertaking that programme for their own students.</p><p>In relation to other grant schemes, this is a matter for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p></reply>

The length of time it takes to get through these stages will depend on a variety of factors, including the size and complexity of the relevant project. Critically, it is also dependent on how well progress is made through the statutory approvals process. </p>  <p>  It is too early at this stage of the architectural planning process to provide an accurate timeframe as to how long the projects in question will take to deliver. I can inform the Deputy, however, that all seven of the schools included in Project Nore, one of the bundles of projects in the NDFA programme, had completed Stage 1 of this process by October 2020 in circumstances where the design team was appointed in April 2020. This is an excellent outcome in terms of the timeframes for completion of this stage of the process given the number and complexity of the projects in question. </p>  <p>  Project Nore is currently in the final stages of the Stage 2A process which is further excellent progress.</p></reply>

Each acquisition is also very unique and dependant on multiple factors many which may be outside of the control of my Department.</p>  <p>  As per my Department's published technical guidance documents, a criteria is used to identify and evaluate the suitability of potential sites including zoning, existing services, site orientation, topography, transport and access. In this regard, my Department makes use of its own in-house professional and technical staff in relation to the technical assessment of sites, to ensure the suitability of a given site for the development of a school building. Each potential site also requires the consideration of complex technical issues in conjunction with the local authority. The Deputy will appreciate the importance of conducting a thorough appraisal of site options before proceeding with an acquisition in order to obtain best value for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Once a site has been evaluated and identified as suitable, negotiations can begin with the appropriate landowner. This stage can be equally challenging, and the conditions of each acquisition is very much dependent on the individual circumstances. Once negotiations are agreed in principle, it allows the conveyancing process to begin, where issue with property title may arise. Some acquisitions may, due to the planning risk attached to a particular site, be subject to a grant of planning permission which can further delay the acquisition of a site. In this regard, the Deputy will appreciate it is not possible to give a specific timeframe for the completion of site acquisitions.</p></reply>

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020/2021 academic year.</p>  <p>  My Department has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021.   </p>  <p>  These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020. It will also ensure that any final year students have the opportunity to graduate as scheduled in summer 2021.   </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for the re-instatement of the grant to cover the full cost of the Gaeltacht Learning Periods (GLPs) for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary ITE programmes, with effect from the 2020/2021 academic year.  The grant was previously funded by my Department up to the 2012/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints. The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650. This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements.</p>  <p>  In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p>  <p>  It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme. HEIs are currently working directly with their Gaeltacht College providers on implementing the practical and administrative arrangements for delivery of the GLP.</p>  <p>  An allowance has been made for 2nd year Professional Masters in Education (PME) students (including students in the College referred to by the Deputy). Those 2nd year PME students who have not completed any GLP will now complete a 3 week online programme (had previously been required to complete 4 weeks). 2nd year PME students who have completed some of their required GLP will now be required to complete the remaining balance (up to a total requirement of 3 weeks) online. This particular allowance, approved by the Teaching Council's Education Committee, recognised the significant timetabling issues facing 2nd year PME students in respect of school placement, the GLP and normal course work.</p>  <p>  The College referred to by the Deputy is an independent private provider of ITE programmes. In relation to the cost of the online programme for students in the College referred to by the Deputy, my Department has recently responded to a proposal from that College confirming that both my Department and the Teaching Council has no issue with that College, working in collaboration with a Gaeltacht College(s) to provide an online programme based on the agreed syllabus for their own students and to negotiate and set the cost for undertaking that programme for their own students.</p>  <p>  The estimated cost of extending the grant to cover all cohorts in the College referred to by the Deputy due to attend the GLPs in 2021 is &euro;1.19m. This is estimated using a variety of average costs due to the duration of the GLP ranging from one to three weeks.  The estimated costs of extending the grant to those in their final year only is &euro;0.53m.</p></reply>

Minor works funding of &euro;160m has been put in place to support these measures.</p>  <p>  Practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices was provided to the school system in the context of re-opening for September 2020. This guidance was reviewed and updated on 30 November.</p>  <p>  In summary, the overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times (assuming not in use) and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use. It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms. Managing comfort levels will be easier for schools now than during the winter period.</p>  <p>  In updating the guidance in November, the Department's Planning and Building Unit reviewed the HPSC guidance that consideration be given to installing an indoor air quality monitor in classrooms. The updated guidance sets out that in the main windows are likely to be required to be open at a frequency and level in the classroom irrespective of whether the opening of windows is prompted through the indoor air quality monitor (re-active approach) or through the pro-active approach outlined in the Department's guidance and that therefore it is not considered necessary to install such monitors in classrooms. However, the updated guidance indicates that it is a matter for individual schools to consider whether they wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for this purpose or alternatively schools may wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for provision of permanent background ventilation, where required, as referenced in the guidance.</p>  <p>  This guidance is one of a number of prevention and control measures in place to ensure schools are very safe.</p>  <p>  An expert group on ventilation has recently been formed to advise the national public health emergency team (NPHET) across a range of settings. The work of this group will help guide whether any further update on the Department's guidance is required.</p></reply>

I am particularly conscious of the impact that school closures have on children with special needs.</p><p>I am particularity conscious of the impact school closures have on  children with special educational needs.</p><p>Building on the return to school in recent weeks of children in special schools and in special classes at primary and post-primary level, the Government has decided on a phased return of students to in-school education.</p><p>These further phases have been developed in close collaboration with education stakeholders and follow ongoing engagement with the Department of Health and Public Health, HSE.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE have reaffirmed that schools in themselves are low risk environments and that a gradual phased reopening can occur at this time. Public health has reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools and is satisfied that these infection prevention and control measures, if rigorously adhered to, will keep the school community safe during this period. They emphasise that all measures must be followed carefully by students, staff and parents.</p><p>There will be a period of time between each phase to assess the impact of reopening on aspects of community transmission.</p><p>The phased return of students to in-school education and the associated target dates are as follows:</p><p><b>Monday 1 March</b></p><p>- the first four class groups at primary level &ndash; junior and senior infants, first and second class &ndash; and final year Leaving Certificate students will return to in-school provision. This phase will also see a return to full attendance for children in special schools, as well as children in early start pre-school classes and early intervention special classes for children with autism or hearing impairment. </p><p><b>Monday 15 March</b></p><p>- the return to in-school provision of the rest of primary school children &ndash; third to sixth class, and fifth year Leaving Certificate students. This date will be reviewed during the period following 1 March.</p><p><b>Monday 12 April </b></p><p><b>- </b>the return to in-school education of the rest of post-primary students following the Easter &ndash; i.e. first to fourth year students.</p><p>My Department is anxious to further support those pupils/students with SEN who are unable to return to in-school teaching and learning under these phases.</p><p>At Primary level in recognition that not all primary pupils with special education needs will be back in school in this phase:</p><p>- Schools have been asked to prioritise deployment of their SET resources to facilitate the engagement of those pupils with SEN who are in 3rd to 6th class. This will necessitate further collaboration between the SETs and class teachers to establish current priority learning needs among those pupils.</p><p>- The supplementary programme for eligible pupils who are in 3rd to 6th class will be extended by a further two weeks. </p><p>At Post-Primary level in recognition that not all students with special education needs will be back in school in this phase:</p><p>- The supplementary programme for eligible students who have not yet returned to school will be extended by a further two weeks.</p><p>The supplementary programme is intended to supplement the teaching and learning provided by the student's school and alleviate the impact of this period of school closure through the provision of 5 hours per week in-person teaching or care support to be delivered in homes.</p><p>The programme must be delivered outside of the normal school day (i.e. evenings and weekends), so that the student can continue to engage as fully as possible with the teaching and learning provided by their school.</p><p>Any unused hours can be delivered to families at any time before 30 April 2021, including during the Easter holidays.</p><p>My Department has been contacted by schools and families who wish to access the supplementary programme in school settings. My Department is willing to engage with the education stakeholders, particularly the school management bodies on the logistical issues which may need to be considered in the running of this programme in school premises, particularly as this programme is intended to happen outside of school hours such as evenings and weekends.</p><p>I know that a phased re-opening is particularly challenging for many children with special educational needs who have not yet returned to school and their families.</p><p>The purpose of managing this cautious phased return is to continue to limit the mobility of the population and curb the spread of the virus.</p><p>The safe return and sustained safe re-opening of our schools is a key priority for Government.</p></reply>

The guidance sets out approaches that schools can take to support the continued participation of students and my Department has asked schools to ensure that there is a specific focus on ensuring that these students are supported.  </p><p>My Department has ongoing engagement with Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) and education stakeholders to encourage and support engagement with those learners in need of support. Where schools remain closed, the three support strands of TESS (Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs), School Completion Programme (SCP) Coordinators and Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) officers) continue to provide supports to those children and young people who are most at risk of early school leaving. </p><p>My Department identified as an objective for September 2020 that all students should return to education as normal to the fullest extent possible, while recognising that in some cases, this would be more difficult for particular students.  The guidance document Reconnecting with Education - Guidance for post-primary schools for students at risk of early school leaving was developed and published by my Department, to support schools in encouraging students to return to school to complete their education. The guidance also outlines how students could be supported in reconnecting and continuing with their education with the assistance of Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) where required, or on a pathway to further education, training or apprenticeship with the assistance of guidance counsellors and local Education and Training Boards.  </p><p>The official number of early school is published annually in the retention report.

The Department&rsquo;s role continues to be that of CE funder. </p><p>This issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p><p>In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors could potentially give rise to claims for funding for employees in the broader sector.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to any potential Exchequer exposure associated with dealing with the specific issue as regards CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.</p><p>At this point, I want to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p><p>The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing CE Supervisors continue to engage in discussions and I am hopeful that, with goodwill and flexibility on all sides, a resolution can be found in the near future.</p><p>The Deputy should note that funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.  <b></b></p><p>Nevertheless I, and my colleague the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform are keen to find an approach that will resolve this issue in the near future.</p></reply>

Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs). </p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The scheme ensures that for those who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.</p><p>Under the SWA scheme, a supplement can be awarded to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  In addition, officers can make a single exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

This fulfils a key commitment in the Programme for Government to provide a benefit payment for people who are aged 65 and who are required to or who choose to retire early, without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.</p>  <p>  This new payment is specifically designed to bridge the gap for people who are required to or who choose to retire at age 65 but who do not qualify for the State Pension until they reach age 66.</p>  <p>  To be eligible to apply for the payment a person must no longer be engaged in employment or self employment.  New applicants must also satisfy the PRSI conditionality for the scheme which includes having the required contributions in the Governing Contribution Year (GCY), which is the second last complete tax year.  For example, for a claim in 2021 the second last complete tax year is 2019. </p>  <p>  If a person does not have the required 13 paid contributions in the GCY they must have the 13 contributions paid in either of the two tax years before the GCY, the last complete tax year or the current tax year. </p>  <p>  Jobseekers Benefit is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  Jobseekers over 65 years of age whose benefit had expired may be paid benefit up until pensionable age (66 years) provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions. </p>  <p>  Any person who does not meet the qualifying conditions for receipt of the new Benefit Payment for 65 year olds may apply for the means tested jobseeker's allowance subject to satisfying the rules of that scheme.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, the details should be forwarded to the Department for review of the individual circumstances.</p></reply>

As an exceptional measure, this scheme was extended as part of the July Stimulus in response to Covid-19 whereby the qualification period for Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) recipients is waived in these cases.  This ensures that those who have lost their employment during the pandemic have immediate access to a range of educational options.</p>  <p>  Where a person in receipt of PUP wishes to apply for BTEA, they are required to transfer to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The rate of BTEA will be linked to the individual&rsquo;s qualifying social welfare rate of payment.  This ensures consistency with other jobseekers undertaking similar types of courses. </p>  <p>  Whereas the PUP is short term in nature, the BTEA can provide longer term income support which can be provided for the duration of an education course, depending on an individual&rsquo;s circumstances. </p>  <p>  Where someone in receipt of jobseekers&rsquo; payments or PUP wishes to pursue short-term or part-time study, they can continue to receive their payment, including PUP. </p>  <p>  Any person seeking to return to education is advised to engage with their local Intreo Centre to assess their options.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position for you.</p></reply>

The estimated full year cost of the scheme in 2021 is over &euro;18 million.  To receive the allowance a customer of my Department must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and also in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance.  The scheme supports recipients by assisting with the cost of communications and/or home security solutions.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government decided to allocate one third of additional carbon tax revenues to boosting the incomes of the poorest in our society.  The Government commissioned ESRI research which identified three key payments by the Department of Social Protection to channel carbon tax revenues towards this cohort.  These were the Qualified Child Allowance, the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, effective from January 2021, the weekly Fuel Allowance payment has been increased by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28 for a period of 28 weeks.  Also from January 2021, Qualified Child payments have been increased by &euro;2 per week, from &euro;36 to &euro;38 per week, for children under 12 years of age and by &euro;5 per week, from &euro;40 to &euro;45 per week, for children aged 12 and over.  It is estimated that this will benefit 419,000 children who are most in need.  The Living Alone Allowance was also increased in Budget 2021 by &euro;5 from &euro;14 to &euro;19 at an overall cost in 2021 of &euro;57.5 million. </p>  <p>  Therefore, all TSA recipients have benefitted from an increase in payments totalling &euro;8.50 weekly during Fuel Season and &euro;5 outside Fuel Season, as a result of Budget 2021 changes.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department operates both Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p>  <p>  All proposals, including any proposals to increase the Telephone Support Allowance for people to help them to afford a landline service necessary for home security or medical emergency alerting systems, could only be considered while taking account of overall Government policy and in a budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These investigations can include site visits or visits to offices or tax agents representing employers where inspections involving an examination of PRSI records in relation to multiple employees may be undertaken, and enquiries/visits where an individual employee&rsquo;s record may be checked.  An inspector may also seek to establish that the necessary employment records are being kept or if Social Welfare scheme payments are being appropriately made.</p><p>In some instances, investigations are undertaken jointly with other State agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Workplace Relations Commission.  This activity facilitates an approach whereby compliance issues across agencies can be looked at and ensures that appropriate sharing of information takes place. The works involves the examination of contractors and employees engaged on sites and premises where employment is taking place.</p><p>In conducting employer inspections, the role of the Social Welfare inspector is primarily in relation to an employer&rsquo;s compliance under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act i.e. that the correct PPSN of employees, the correct employer number, the correct number of weeks worked, the correct PRSI class and the correct earnings are recorded.  As such, an inspector can seek any information required in order to determine such compliance.</p><p>The inspector may also make enquiries with regard to payments made under Social Welfare schemes such as ensuring that employees are not concurrently working and claiming.</p><p>It is not the role of my Department to check for compliance with Sectoral Employment Orders.  This falls to the Workplace Relations Commission.  However, some employer inspections carried out by my inspectors are joint agency inspections and may involve inspectors from the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 990,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  Any possible extension to the eligibility criteria for free travel to include those with long-term health conditions such as epilepsy, who are not allowed to drive due to their diagnosis, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, would have significant implications for the free travel scheme.  It would be expected that any such decision would immediately lead to calls for all people who had a disability and/or significant health issues to be eligible for a free travel pass.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who had a disability and/or significant health issues, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p>  <p>  The main income supports for carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2021 is expected to exceed &euro;1.4 billion.   </p>  <p>  At the end of December 2020, there were 88,906 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2021 is approximately &euro;953 million. </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means tested payment made to people whose income falls below certain limits, and who are looking after certain people in need of full-time care and attention.  The means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system.  Currently &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.</p>  <p>  An estimate of the full-year cost of increasing the means test threshold for entitlement to carer's allowance in &euro;50 intervals up to &euro;950 per week is not available in the timeframe within which the response to the Deputy's question must be provided.  Carer's Allowance has recently been included in the updated ESRI SWITCH microsimulation model which is used for estimates such as the one requested.  When the estimates are available from my Department, I will revert to the Deputy directly with the costings. </p>  <p>  Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households.  Some 86% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.</p>  <p>  Changes to schemes may only be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government targeted one third of carbon tax revenues to go towards boosting the incomes of the poorest in our society.  Based on ESRI research, three key DSP payments were targeted for increases in the budget as a result - the Fuel Allowance, the Qualified Child Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance. </p>  <p>  From January 2021, the Fuel Allowance was increased by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28 for a period of 28 weeks, while the increase in carbon tax on solid fuels will not take effect until May 2021.  This will ensure that recipients will benefit from the increased payment over this winter period.  </p>  <p>  The Government will, as it does every year, consider if the 2020/2021 fuel allowance season should be extended beyond 9 April (the end date for the current fuel season) depending on the economic circumstances and prevailing weather conditions.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This change, which is effective from 2 October, meant that people who only commenced employment after February 2020 but were laid-off in October due to increased restrictions can have their payment rate fixed by reference to their earnings in the period March to September 2020.  </p>  <p>   As a result of extending the reference period to the end of September 2020, some 37,430 receiving PUP on 17 November received an increase in their rate of payment. </p>  <p>  A significant number of those who benefitted from the extended reference period are due arrears, either to the 2 October or the date of commencement of their claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, whichever is the later.</p>  <p>  During the months of November and December, a number of very significant IT changes were in progress in relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  These included the finalisation of the general arrears project involving 286,000 additional payments on 1 December, payment of the Christmas Bonus on 8 December to just over 283,000 recipients of the PUP, and advance payments over the Christmas period.  My Department has also been focused on responding to the increased numbers of people applying for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, with an increase of over 200,000 claims in payment since the start of this year.  Against that background, and in order to ensure continuity of service delivery, it was not possible to introduce the necessary IT changes to allow for processing of any re-rate arrears which may have arisen. </p>  <p>  The necessary IT development work to ensure processing of any of these arrears has now been completed. 38,618 individuals whose claims are currently in payment received arrears totalling &euro;12.6 million on 23 February, with the vast majority of these cases relating to the period from 2 October to 5 November 2020.  Any arrears due in respect of claims which are currently closed will be processed shortly.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-24a.1625.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021022400086#WRCC06100"><p>The main income supports for carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2021 is expected to exceed &euro;1.4 billion.   </p>  <p>  At the end of December 2020, there were 88,906 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2021 is approximately &euro;953 million. </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities. This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. </p>  <p>  In order to support a carer&rsquo;s continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, of up to 18.5 hours per week while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  Just as in the case of other income support payments carer's allowance is not intended to be a compensatory payment for the full value of earnings foregone nor is it a payment by the State in recognition of caring services rendered. </p>  <p>  My Department carried out a comprehensive Policy Review of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2019 including an examination of the means test.  </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;120 per week (as per Budget 2021 this will increase to &euro;140 per week from June 2021).  For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall expenditure and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  It should be noted that some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  However, any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in an overall budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It has been decided that the person satisfies the medical criteria for IP.  To qualify for IP a claimant must, inter-alia, have at least 260 (5 years) paid PRSI contributions since entering social insurance and 48 contributions paid or credited in the last or second last complete contribution years before the relevant date of their claim.  It was decided the relevant date of the claim in question is 2020 and he does not have the required 48 paid or credited contributions in the last or second last year before the relevant date of his claim. The claim was refused under the governing legislation on the grounds that the contribution conditions for the scheme are not satisfied.  As he last worked in Spain, a request was sent to the Spanish Authorities on 10 February 2021 for his Spanish insurance record.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, claims processed under Bilateral/EU Regulations are more complex and can take longer to finalise as the Department is highly dependent on receiving necessary information from other States.

Breastfeeding breaks can be taken as a one hour break, two 30 minute breaks or three 20 minute breaks. Breaks may be longer and more frequent if agreed between the new mother and her employer. Mothers working part-time are also entitled to breastfeeding breaks, calculated on a pro-rata basis.</p><p>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth adheres to the Provision of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007. Part 6, Chapter 2 of the regulations apply to employees that are pregnant, have just had a baby or are breast feeding. Two rooms are designated that can be used for the purposes of breastfeeding or expressing milk in the Department's offices. More detailed information on breastfeeding and lactation breaks for civil servants is set out in paragraph 9 of Department of Finance Circular 31/2006:- Implementation of the Regulations of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004, which is available at </p><p><i> </i></p><p>A commitment in &ldquo;FIRST 5: A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families&rdquo; provides for a review of the relevant provisions of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 on the issue of extending the current entitlement to paid time off work for breastfeeding mothers from 26 to 104 weeks after the baby&rsquo;s birth. This reflects a similar commitment in the National Strategy on Women and Girls 2017-2020.</p><p>Work is underway in my Department on legislative proposals in this regard. The provisions are being drafted for inclusion within an early appropriate Bill.</p></reply>

I am cognisant that, on becoming a data controller later this month, my Department will assume particular responsibilities under GDPR including the right to rectification under Article 16.  It is my intention to apply the principles of GDPR to applications by individuals to seek access to their personal information. </p>  <p>  I am also committed to legislating to provide the widest possible access to early life information for individuals seeking this information. To this end, the Heads of Bill for the forthcoming enhanced Information and Tracing legislation will be ready for pre-legislative scrutiny by the end of March or early April.</p>  <p>  As part of its recommendations, the Commission has also highlighted the potential to further develop the database it compiled during the course of its investigation.  While this will require bespoke legislation, the Government is certainly committed to further development of the database and to the creation of a central repository of records. </p>  <p>  As a first step, my Department has appointed an archivist to lead the work on the preservation of, and public access to, the relevant records within my department.  This archivist is part of a new dedicated Information Management Unit which my Department has established to lead on receipt and management of the Commission&rsquo;s archive, applications for access to these records, in addition to broader records management work.</p></reply>

Families may have emerging or changing needs which services must address, or services may have to adapt to deliver support in new ways. In 2020, my Department launched the Supporting Children campaign to encourage all of us to look out for those who may be particularly vulnerable. It also draws attention to the robust service and support network in place through my Department and Tusla, including the Tusla ABC Programme.</p>  <p>  The Tusla ABC Programme have reported several adaptions to services including sites ensuring that the needs of some of their targeted families from the Traveller communities, families living in homeless hubs and Direct Provision are identified are met, delivering Speech and Language services using tele-therapy and home learning packs, and strengthened collaborative planning in delivery of practical supports to children and families across Tusla&rsquo;s prevention and early intervention programmes, such as  ABCs, Family Resource Centres, Child &amp;amp; Family Support Networks and CYPSCs.</p>  <p>  The 2021 Tusla ABC Budget has been secured and funding commitments have been communicated to local partners, including Early Learning Initiative/Docklands ABC.

In line with reporting conventions previously used by the Department of Justice, Tusla has applied the latter standard, given that this reflects the community-focused integrated response for victims, where community-based organisations and outreach supports are in place alongside refuges. </p>  <p>  Tusla is undertaking a review of emergency accommodation nationwide. This will assess the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation. The review's findings and the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee of the Second National Strategy on DSGBV will inform Tusla's future decisions on priority areas for investment and development of services. Tusla has advised me that the report will be published in Quarter 2 this year.</p>  <p>  It is of the utmost importance that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible. I strongly support the work of Tusla and its funded service providers and I am committed to supporting the Agency in meeting the needs of individuals who experience domestic violence.</p></reply>

All children and young people need safeguarding and the Government recognises that specific groups of children and young people are particularly at risk and need additional supports. </p><p>Significant progress has been made under outcome 3, action 3.1, with the introduction of the Children First Act 2015. The Act, which was signed into law in November 2015 and fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children and the introduction of mandatory reporting of child protection concerns by certain key professionals. </p><p>The Act also places specific obligations on organisations providing relevant services to keep children safe from harm whilst availing of their services, to carry out a risk assessment and to develop a Child Safeguarding Statement that outlines the policies and procedures in place to manage the risks identified.  </p><p>The Act operates side-by-side with the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children. The guidance sets out definitions of abuse, and signs for its recognition. It explains how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla. It sets out what organisations need to do to keep children safe. It also describes the obligations under the Children First Act 2015 and who they attach to. These guidelines have been in place since 1999 and were fully revised and published in October 2017 to include reference to the provisions of the Act. </p><p>Work under outcome 3, action 3.1 is continuing including through the Children First Inter-Departmental Implementation Group (IDIG). The Group, which was established on a statutory basis under the Children First Act, is chaired by my Department and includes members from every Government Department as well as representatives from Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive. The Group promotes compliance by Government Departments with their obligations under the Children First Act and is a forum where members can raise child welfare and protection issues of general concern or with a cross-sectoral dimension.  </p><p>There has been much progress in relation to learning from investigations and reviews on child protection.  In the context of these themes both my Department and Tusla has further progressed significant improvements in these areas as summarised below: </p><p>- Early intervention &amp;amp; family support &ndash; through the What Works and the Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme.</p><p>- Out-of-hours services &ndash; expanded from the Dublin region to the entire country with on call support through a dedicated phone line and with social workers located in each of the 17 Areas of the country. </p><p>- Interagency collaboration - through full scaling and implementation of Children and Young People's Services Committees; and Tusla establishment of National Interagency protocols with the HSE and has a Joint Working Protocol with AGS under Children First. </p><p>- Child and youth participation &ndash; Tusla has developed and is in ongoing implementation of a Child and Youth Participation Strategy 2019-23.</p><p>- Child protection conferences &ndash; Tusla has a national children&rsquo;s register for children at ongoing risk of significant harm called the Child Protection Notification System and this system is accessible by other key professionals who play a role in safeguarding and protecting children. </p><p>- Recording and Data Management&ndash; Tusla has established one integrated National Child Care Information System and has a comprehensive Data Management Strategy.</p><p>- The HIQA Statutory Investigation 2018 and its report and recommendation saw the establishment of an Expert Assurance Group to oversee Tusla&rsquo;s progress against all actions arising from this investigation report. </p><p>- In 2017 Signs of Safety was adopted as the national approach to practice, to assist in the delivery of consistent responses to child protection concerns nationally. There was a three year implementation strategy to train all Tusla staff in the Signs of Safety approach, to upgrade all IT systems to align with the Signs of Safety format and to realign all internal policies with the new approach. The child protection and welfare strategy, called Creating Effective Safety runs from 2017-2022. </p><p>- Child sexual abuse - Development of the Barnahus model which is an Icelandic and EU model for child friendly centres for abuse victims. Integrating forensic medical, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla specialist interviewing with therapeutic support in one centre to reduce trauma for the child. Tusla is a partner in the Barnahus network.  </p><p>My Department works closely with Tusla to ensure that the learning from the range of review and regulatory mechanisms in place relating to child protection and welfare serves to directly inform policy development and organisational performance. Tusla as an organisation has proactively placed a priority focus on this area in its self-assessment mechanisms and its performance conferencing processes. </p><p>Next month, my Department is planning to bring together the range of regulatory and review bodies to share the learning relating to the protection, welfare and wellbeing of children. This will support a more strategic approach to ensuring the transfer and implementation of learning to address issues that impact on the safety, welfare and protection of children.</p></reply>

The specifications for this tender included the provision of food and household items through a points system by way of an on-site foodhall whereby residents can obtain the items they need at no cost to themselves. Under the terms of the contract the service provider is also required to consult regularly with residents to help ensure the produce available in the in-house store is both ethnically and culturally appropriate to their needs.   </p>  <p>  This model was used in all eight of the regional tender competitions for the provision of such accommodation, of which the Borders Region was the last chronologically to take place. The provision of an onsite foodhall was crucial to the bid from all successful tenderers and would have been factored into their costs.  Tenders were evaluated on the Most Economically Advantageous Tender model, whereby bids are assessed on a combination of the quality of the proposal of service delivery and price. Quality of the proposal of service delivery was 60% of overall marks while price was 40%.</p>  <p>  It would undermine the integrity of the procurement process if bidders were asked (either individually or collectively) to change the service delivery model from that contained in the specifications following assessment and contract award.  </p>  <p>  Port Road, Letterkenny will be the 30th accommodation centre to come through the tendering process. All of the accommodation centres that have been procured through this process provide residents with items through the points based foodhall system. The foods available to residents generally include a wide range of fresh meats, fruit, vegetables and ethnic goods. Residents can carry over points not used in any one week to the next week, subject to a maximum of four weeks. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department understand that the foodhall system works very well and residents are generally satisfied with the system. It is important to note that the foodhall system is an additional measure being provided in accommodation centres which allows for independent living. </p>  <p>  Additionally, residents will be in receipt of a daily expenses allowance and many residents will qualify for permission to access the labour market and will do so.

As a result, many mothers effectively had little to no choice other than to put their baby up for adoption.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that the Commission reviewed a major body of documentary evidence in this regard and that additional records or documentation may simply not exist, to support an effective revisiting of this matter by way of a further Commission or statutory inquiry.</p>  <p>  It is accepted by all parties that, in the past, adoption was often a secretive practice, carried out without due regard to the rights of those involved. Such practice in adoption reflects wider societal prejudices of the time.</p>  <p>  Today, the safeguards in the adoption acts ensure that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all adoption cases, and in every step of the process. Modern day adoption legislation and practice also ensures that the rights of all involved are vindicated, including birth fathers, within the overarching framework of working for the best interests of the child involved.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that every record on adoption represents the lives of a number of individuals. There are major ethical issues at play where the reality, identity and family and legal relationships that people have lived their whole lives may be fundamentally undermined. I am also concerned that the records may simply not exist, to effectively revisit adoptions that have taken place.</p>  <p>  From listening to survivors I believe that what is most important is access to birth certs and early life information for adoptees. Addressing this issue is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan in response to the Commission&rsquo;s Report. It is a priority for myself, the Attorney and the Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  My Department and I are engaging intensively with the Attorney General to find a solution to the issue of release of birth information, including birth certificates.  Through this engagement with the Attorney, I am hopeful that we will have Heads of Bill by end March/ early April.</p>  <p>  My priority is having an effective information and tracing service available so that any individual with a question about their origins is empowered to access their own records and supported by a robust statutory tracing service.  This ensures that any investigations are at the request of an individual, rather than initiated by the State.</p></reply>

Notably, the Commission recognises that redress can be financial or in the form of enhanced services. In the context of comparable previous redress arrangements, the Commission identifies a number of specific groups for whom it recommends redress might be considered. </p>  <p>  The Government has made a very significant and early commitment to accept these recommendations and design a bespoke Restorative Recognition Scheme. I have now established an Interdepartmental Group on Restorative Recognition (IDG). Crucially, the Government agreed that the IDG would not be limited in examining solely the three criteria put forward by the Report as grounds for restorative recognition. The IDG held its first meeting on the 4 February and has been tasked with reporting back to me by the end of April to enable specific proposals to be brought to Government. </p>  <p>  It has been asked to develop detailed proposals for a restorative recognition scheme.  Its work must take account of the specific groups identified by the Commission but is not limited to those groups.  Its work will be underpinned by a human rights focus and informed by strong stakeholder consultation and an understanding of lessons learned from the operation of previous schemes.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the scheme will be designed as quickly as possible in 2021. </p>  <p>  This is a hugely important process for all connected to these institutions and I will be working with colleagues and survivors to advance these matters as a priority.</p></reply>

These arrangements were subsequently extended until 5 March.</p><p>An essential worker is someone who works in an essential service. Only one parent need qualify as an essential worker for their child to be eligible to access ELC/SAC services.  For the purposes of accessing ELC/SAC an essential worker may be working from home.  ELC/SAC providers have been asked to ensure that a place is available for all children of essential workers within their service.</p><p>The full list of essential services is available here: </p><p>Parents who are having difficulty finding places are advised to contact their local CCC.

The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level. </p><p>- An <b>income-related subsidy</b>is payable for children from 24 weeks to 15 years of age who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider. The level of subsidy is determined by the family&rsquo;s assessable income (i.e. gross income minus tax, PRSI and other deductibles and minus any applicable multiple child discount).</p><p>Families engaged in work or study can qualify for up to 45 hours of subsidised childcare per week.  Information on the NCS can be found at www.ncs.gov.ie and by phoning the Parent Support Centre at 01 906 8530.

A project plan has been in place by the consortium since October 2020 and my Department is being kept updated on its progress. To date &euro;8.8 million has been provided in co-funding of the consortium&rsquo;s proposals, the most recent tranche of &euro;5.1 million was allocated under the Transformation Fund in October 2020.</p>  <p>  Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs and course provision. My Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions. The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions. The HEA funding model includes weightings for the relative costs of providing education in different disciplines and tuition fee payments for free fees eligible students. As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding is a matter for the individual institution.</p>  <p>  The legal requirements for the appointment of the first governing body of a technological university is prescribed under Section 55 of the Technological Universities Act 2018. An appointments process is not set in train until a TU has been designated following the prescribed legislative assessment and decision-making processes under the Act.  </p>  <p>   TU structures and campus related issues are matters in the first instance for a TU as an autonomous higher education institution. Further work is required to advance sectoral apposite career structures in accordance with the 2019 TURN report recommendations. In this context my Department is engaged with the HEA regarding the undertaking of an independent expert bench marking exercise relating to issues including organisation design and academic career structures. This would form part of a progressive, inclusive process with appropriate national inputs.</p>  <p>   There is no such term in TU legislation as &lsquo;headquarters&rsquo; and upon its establishment it is a matter for a TU, as embodied by the governing body which constitutes staff and student representatives and external members drawn from wider stakeholder groups, as to the functionality of any particular campus within an integrated multi-campus structure.  </p>  <p>  In my view the focus should continue to be on the benefits of establishing a TU for the entire South East and in supporting and assisting the finalisation and submission of an application for TU designation by the TUSEI consortium.</p></reply>

Within this overall context, the creation of Technological Universities represents a radical reconfiguration of the higher education landscape, which will deliver significant benefits for regional development.  This will be achieved through a strong focus on industry linkages, higher education access, and research-informed teaching and learning excellence across the full range of the National Framework of Qualifications.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there are two major Exchequer-funded projects in the pipeline which will significantly enhance higher education infrastructure in the South East and support the development of the new TU.  An engineering, ICT and teaching building is planned for the WIT campus - the largest of all projects under the Higher Education Public Private Partnership Programme and a science and health building is planned for IT Carlow under the same programme.</p>  <p>  I have been clear in my commitment to expanding the imprint of higher education across the south east region. This includes achieving a long term ambition of securing a more suitable site for IT Carlow's higher education provision in Wexford town and a larger footprint for higher education in Waterford - a city which is targeted for a compact and sustainable population growth of 50% under Project Ireland 2040.  Officials from my Department and the HEA continue to have regular engagement with Waterford IT and IT Carlow in relation to future campus development plans. This is key to the wider strategy for the future TU for the South East.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p>  <p>  The application process generally opens in late March/early April. When students apply for grant support, the application is assessed and the student is notified of the decision in principle. This allows the student an opportunity to appeal a decision before a final decision is made. In a small number of cases, some students don&rsquo;t subsequently qualify for grant support.  I can confirm that 743 students were initially awarded grants but have since had the grants withdrawn by SUSI for the 2020/21 academic year as of 22/2/2021.</p>  <p>  The withdrawal of an awarded SUSI grant may be due to a number of reasons, such as:</p>  <p>  - An applicant registers for a different course to the course that was previously awarded e.g. the initial decision in principle was in respect of an approved course and the student subsequently attends a course that does not qualify for support;</p>  <p>  - An applicant was initially assessed as qualifying for a fee grant only for a course within Ireland and is now attending a course overseas or a PLC course within the State where fee grants are not payable;</p>  <p>  - New information from the applicant or college is received advising that the applicant is not progressing to the year of the course that the grant was awarded to; and</p>  <p>  - Post Assessment Quality Reviews carried out on applications for the current academic year discover that a student does not qualify for support.</p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. </p>  <p>  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant). Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie.</p></reply>

Deferrals are granted at the discretion of the Higher Education Institutions and the sector has indicated that there was no significant increase or decrease in the number of deferrals in 2020 in comparison to previous years. Although a full analysis of the Semester 2 registration data has not yet been completed, there is no indication of any significant change in the non-progression rate in comparison to previous years.

Some of those representations have student mental health as the primary topic, while many others express concerns regarding the subject together with other matters. My Department would require to undertake further analysis to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s query therefore or perhaps the Deputy could provide some more specific information as to the correspondence he is referencing.</p>  <p>  The support and wellbeing of our students is one of my priorities, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increased stress and pressure resulting from it.</p>  <p>  In 2020, I secured a comprehensive package of financial support in the amount of &euro;168m for the Higher Education and Further Education and Training sector to mitigate against the direct financial impact of COVID-19 on our Universities, institutions, colleges and students in 2020. This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This funding is enabling institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors and Assistant Psychologists.</p>  <p>  The HEA wrote to all HEIs in 2020 setting each institutions funding allocation towards student support and mental health and wellbeing and the conditions attaching to the funding, including a request that the HEIs distribute it in support of specific student facing areas such as the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, which I launched last year.</p>  <p>  This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. The Framework delivers on a commitment to develop national guidelines for the higher education institutions (HEIs) in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which might exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education. The Framework additionally recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  The Framework provides very clear guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties. The HEA has partnered with the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention and Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education Ireland (PCHEI) in providing training in a specialist suicide assessment and management approach. Over 300 psychologists and counsellors across 26 higher education institutions are currently undertaking Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality training, a first in world at this scale across a sector.  The CAMS approach is supported by over 70 studies and given the origins of its development was a university mental health setting, it fits well in a higher education context.  This is further support for student counselling services to meet the complex and challenging needs that present on campuses at an increasing rate in the past number of years.  This also addresses Goal 5 in the Department of Health&rsquo;s Connecting for Life &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020: "To ensure safe and high-quality services for people vulnerable to suicide."  Together with the crisis text line 50808 that I launched in October 2020, I'm confident that capacity to respond to students experiencing high distress and mental health difficulties has been significantly improved over the past 6 months. </p>  <p>  Funding has also helped develop the student counselling services across the Higher Education sector in many ways besides student counsellor resourcing. For example, some institutions have developed new roles of Assistant Psychologist, Student Support Officer and Mental Health Advisors for student mental health supports. Heads of Services have been appointed or further resourced.</p>  <p>  I am very encouraged that the Framework and the additional funding has had immediate impact. The increased capacity has created a lot of activity in outreach to students: online support groups (anxiety support, mood management); open, drop in groups to support connection/reduce isolation and loneliness; groups specifically targeting international students, first year students and postgraduates. The additional funding has also supported a very significant increase in workshops being offered such as on resilience; managing fear/anxiety/uncertainty; grief and loss during the pandemic; motivation/staying engaged with college.</p></reply>

As a result of the decision to minimise on-site teaching, all universities have confirmed that students who opted to leave their university-owned student accommodation as a result of reduced on-campus activity will be offered refunds or rental credits. The processing of these refunds is a matter for the universities themselves, and any student who wishes to receive a refund for their on-campus accommodation should engage directly with their university&rsquo;s accommodation office. </p>  <p>  In the case of privately-owned student accommodation, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances that students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board. </p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance is being provided in academic year 2020/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. </p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant have received a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.</p>  <p>  The combined impact of these supports and initiatives highlight the strength of the Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting the costs of third level education.</p></reply>

For instance, in the 2020/21 academic year, the HEA has supported the national, sectoral and local roll out of online consent training and online bystander intervention training, as well as the development of a national Anonymous Reporting Tool for issues of bullying, harassment, and sexual harassment. </p>  <p>  In September 2020, the HEA requested a progress update from HEIs on the Framework for Consent to assess progress and enable benchmarking and sharing of good practice across the sector. These updates revealed that much progress has been made in implementing the framework to date. Across the HEIs, 63% of actions in the framework have been implemented or are in progress, with a further 31% in the planning phase. </p>  <p>  Ahead of formal reporting on the Framework implementation in Autumn 2021, the HEIs are to submit to the HEA, by the end of March 2021, specific institutional action plans around tackling sexual harassment.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HEIs Annual Governance Statements submitted to the HEA require a statement confirming that an institution has applied the institutional processes which will support achievement of the objectives of the Framework for Consent.</p>  <p>  In order to create a robust evidence base for further policy decisions in relation to tackling sexual violence and harassment in HEIs, the HEA is working with stakeholders to develop and commission national surveys of staff and students to monitor their experiences. These surveys are expected to launched this April.  </p></reply>

This initiative which enabled a bulk purchase of approximately 16,500 laptops on behalf of higher education institutions is intended to help address concerns regarding the digital divide in the context of the shift to online and blended models of learning, and the importance of supporting disadvantaged students to adapt to these new models of learning.</p>  <p>  The delivery through the National Broadband Plan of high-speed internet connectively nationwide will ultimately provide a solution to current differences in broadband experience for students and learners. In the interim there are initiatives across a number of Government Departments to facilitate connection through community-based broadband hubs and liaison with telecommunication providers on packages, including unlimited data. It is also worth noting that, at the present time HEAnet provides a WiFi solution - Eduroam - designed by and for the higher education community which operates across the education locations nationally. Eduroam allows a student to access WiFi wherever Eduroam is broadcast, enabling a student to seamlessly roam from one Eduroam location to another.</p>  <p>  HEAnet is currently working on options to extend the reach of Eduroam beyond the traditional campus locations to areas within the wider community. An extended Eduroam footprint would greatly overcome connectivity challenges and facilitate staff and students in effective teaching and learning activities based at their home location. HEAnet has already made progress in this regard, with Eduroam now available at many teaching hospitals and several public libraries.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have also recently facilitated engagement between HEAnet and relevant Government Departments and Public Sector Bodies to explore the potential for pilot projects trialling the availability to students of Eduroam, via wi-fi hotspots in public infrastructure owned and/or funded by the State. I anticipate receiving an update from HEAnet on its engagement with these bodies shortly.</p>  <p>  All HEIs make use of virtual learning environments, though some make use of supplemental services to provide video material for lectures.</p>  <p>  It must be understood, however, that Higher Education Institutions are autonomous institutions within the meaning of the Universities Act 1997, the Institutions of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 and the Technological Universities Act 2018. Under this legislation the institutions are academically independent and are entitled to regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes, including the delivery of online classes, and neither I nor my Department have a role in these internal processes.</p></reply>

Government funding has been allocated for the new inquests to cover a number of areas including legal aid for the families, the facilities and equipment for the public facing elements of the inquest at the RDS, advice to the Coroner and related costs.  Budget 2021 included an allocation of up to &euro;8m to cover such costs and all costs will be fully published upon conclusion of the inquests.</p><p>My Department has engaged extensively over a number of months with the legal representative of many of the Stardust families as well as exploring all available avenues to ensure that the families receive the best support in terms of their legal costs. That process has now concluded and the legal representative, the Coroner and the Legal Aid Board have been advised accordingly.  The Coroner has processed the requests by the families for legal support and the Legal Aid Board will process the applications on hand immediately. Although the legislation provides for the payment of legal aid at the end of the inquest, the Department has committed to facilitating the making of payments one month in arrears.</p><p>The timing of the inquests is a matter for the Senior Dublin Coroner, Dr Myra Cullinane, who has already begun her work on this inquest. Three pre-inquest hearings have already taken place. Some delays have been unavoidable with Covid-19 restrictions. The Coroners Society of Ireland agreed that all inquests in the State were not to be held in January given public health considerations under Level 5 restrictions. </p><p>The Department has developed a website for the inquests (<i></i>) and assigned additional resources to the office of the Dublin Coroner to support the Coroner in her work. A dedicated socially-distanced courtroom is currently being built and is almost complete, and the Coroner has visited the new courtroom earlier this week.  Provision for viewing the hearings virtually has also been made. </p><p>The public facing elements of the inquest are expected to commence in Spring 2021, as originally committed to, public health guidance permitting.</p></reply>

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the Covid-19 virus. </p>  <p>  Due to the restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic, I have provided six extensions of immigration permission to 20 April 2021, to ensure that those requiring an immigration permission to work in the state could continue to do so including those providing frontline services. This renewal is on the same basis and with the same conditions attaching to the original permission.</p>  <p>  In addition to the granting of immigration permission to doctors entering the State under the terms of an employment permit, issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my Department also grants specific immigration permission to three distinct cohorts of doctors, under the Atypical Working Scheme (AWS), to allow them to work in the State, as follows:</p>  <p>  - Locum doctors working in the General Practice;</p>  <p>  - Locum doctors providing short-term or emergency cover in hospitals in the State; and</p>  <p>  - Sponsored doctors from Gulf States travelling to Ireland to take part in the International Medical Graduate Training Initiative, operated by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Just over 150 doctors were granted permissions under the Atypical Working Scheme in 2020 and my Department maintains close contact with the key stakeholders involved in the operation of the AWS in so far as it concerns doctors, including the Department of Health, the Health Services Executive, the National Association of GP Co-Ops and the Forum of Irish Postgraduate Medical Training Bodies. </p>  <p>  Regarding citizenship, I was pleased to announce last month that a temporary system is now in place that will enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during COVID-19. It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March and I am pleased to say that more than 500 certificates have recently issued and more will issue in the coming weeks. A significant number of healthcare and other frontline workers who have made extraordinary contributions during the pandemic will also benefit from these new arrangements.</p></reply>

Statistics are not maintained by the Immigration Service of my Department to provide for a breakdown between EEA and non-EEA applicants. </p><p>A number of issues have impacted on the processing of citizenship applications over the past 15 months. A High Court case which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal resulted in significant delays in 2019. As well as this, a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during the pandemic, which has prevented the holding of such ceremonies.  These are usually attended by hundreds of new citizens and have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.</p><p>The combined impact of the Jones judgment and the Covid-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months processing time.  As a result, the processing timeline for standard applications has increased.</p><p>Quite aside from those specific issues, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service. </p><p>In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.</p><p>With regard to improvements to address these issues, last month, I announced that a temporary system is now in place that will help to significantly clear the backlog over the course of this year. The temporary system enables applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during Covid-19. The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and my Department will communicate with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence. It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March and I am pleased to say that more than 500 certificates have issued over the last two weeks.</p><p>The average processing time in months for citizenship applications for the years 2015 &ndash; 2020 are set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Average Processing Time (Months)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>11.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>13.5</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the process is held in high regard both at home and internationally. Section 15 of the Act specifically refers to good character. </p>  <p>  Irish citizenship, and by extension an Irish passport, is one of the most sought after in the world. Ireland, in common with many nations, has a requirement that applicants demonstrate that they are of good character. What exactly good character entails evolves over time, not least to take account of the enactment of new laws. However, an applicant needs to have demonstrated a history of compliance to the laws of the land. An applicant's good character is assessed in a number of ways, including but not limited to:</p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vetting;</p>  <p>  - Home Country Police clearance; and</p>  <p>  - Adherence to the laws and regulations of the State. (This includes laws and regulations relating to revenue, social welfare and driving and transport).</p>  <p>  The application form for naturalisation specifically requires the applicant to list any offences and also provides an opportunity to provide additional details regarding any such offences. The fact that a person has committed an offence does not automatically result in their refusal. The individual facts of each case are assessed. Applicants who are refused are provided with the reasons for their refusal.   </p>  <p>  The Immigration Service of my Department is currently preparing detailed guidelines on the good character criterion, which will be published on the website when finalised.</p></reply>

The offence of theft provided for by this legislation would, based on the broad nature of the offence, include the theft of bicycles. Maximum sentences of 10 years are provided for in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while maximum sentences of 5 years are provided for the offence of possession of stolen property. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will fully appreciate, the Garda Commissioner and his management team are responsible for putting in place targeted Garda operations to tackle bike thefts in Dublin. </p>  <p>  Community Garda&iacute; are also available to provide crime prevention advice to residents' groups in areas affected by thefts, and Garda members keep injured parties appraised as to the status of investigations at all times.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that to try and identify all bicycle thefts which occurred at &lsquo;Rail Stations&rsquo; based on that location type and scanning of narratives or using keywords on the address fields of the Garda PULSE system, would require a significant manual trawl of a high number of incidents.

The PSA is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department and I have no involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Authority.</p>  <p>  However, I can inform the Deputy that in April 2020, the Board of the PSA submitted proposals to my Department for a change in the licence fee for contractors. This proposal took account of the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on the security industry at that time, and also the additional costs which will arise from implementing the new health and safety requirements in the workplace. Having considered this matter against the backdrop of evolving arrangements for reopening society and business, I requested the Board of the PSA to review their proposal in light of what might be the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the security industry.</p>  <p>  An updated proposal was received by my Department from the PSA in October 2020 and as the Deputy can appreciate, due to the potential impact on exchequer receipts it was deemed prudent to first seek the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform approval in this regard. While following consideration the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were of the view that the proposal would at the time be a disproportionate response, they also put forward an alternative proposal in the form of a four month transitional moratorium. </p>  <p>  Having considered the proposal from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the PSA advised my Department that this option was similar to the instalment payment arrangements already available from the PSA to contractors. </p>  <p>  My Department will remain available to continue engagement with all stakeholders in this regard.</p></reply>

This plan maps out a critical path of the various milestones to be achieved from now through to the commencement of the Act and the establishment of the Board.</p>  <p>  My goal is for the full complement of Board members to be ready and available for appointment by end-June 2021 or shortly thereafter; as the Deputy will understand, the appointments cannot be formalised until the Act has been commenced. The final stage of the process will be the drafting and signing of the Commencement Order, which I expect to be ready by July 2021. </p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Parole Act 2019 provides that the Board shall comprise between 12 and 15 members bringing together the professional experience, skills and knowledge of the criminal justice system required to make a reasonable and balanced assessment of cases. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, the majority of members of the Parole Board will be nominated by specified nominating bodies and specified post-holders as set out in Section 10, and appointed by me as Minister in accordance with the relevant legislative provisions. Ensuring gender balance among the membership is an important element of the process and is built into the legislation in a clear and constructive manner. </p>  <p>   I am delighted to note that, as an important first step in the membership process, the Chief Justice has recently nominated Mr Justice Michael White, a High Court Judge, as the inaugural Chairperson of the Parole Board. My Department has commenced initial, preparatory work with Mr Justice Michael White. I have written to the other nominating bodies and specified post-holders in line with subsections 10(3)(b) to 10(3)(h), inclusive, of the above Act and have requested their responses in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  In addition to the nominated members, it remains open to me Minister to appoint between one and four members to the Board directly in line with subsections 10(3) (i) and 10(3)(j), provided that those persons fulfil the eligibility criteria set out in section 10(5) of the Act and have sufficient and appropriate experience and expertise. </p>  <p>  It is my stated preference that the selection of individuals suitable for such appointments would be facilitated via an open Public Appointments Service (PAS) process; my Department has made contact with PAS in this regard and further details about this process will be made public as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Mr Justice White has accepted an invitation by my Department to guide the drafting of the relevant role specifications in this regard. </p>  <p>  In making these appointments, I will take stakeholder perspectives into consideration to the greatest extent possible, bearing in mind the requirement for fair procedures and the need for a range of appropriate expertise in order for the Board to formulate its decisions in a consistent, accountable and robust manner.</p>  <p>  I would also be very happy to see a victim&rsquo;s representative on the Board.</p></reply>

The unit supervises designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) that are not supervised by other competent authorities.  The unit is the competent authority for tax advisors and external accountants that are not otherwise supervised by one of the eight prescribed accountancy bodies. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of accountants in Ireland are members of a prescribed accounting body. The AML/CFT National Risk Assessment indicates that there are 34,000 regulated accountants in Ireland. There is no requirement under the Act for external accountants and tax advisors not otherwise supervised to register with the Unit. </p>  <p>  To date, the AMLCU has identified approximately 200 external accountants that are not otherwise supervised by a prescribed accounting body.  There were 34 on-site regulatory inspections by the Unit of external accountants/tax advisors not otherwise supervised between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2020.  In 2018, under section 66 of the Act, the Unit requested a list from Revenue of those registered as tax advisors. </p>  <p>  27 of the 34 inspected in the period have a tax advisor identification number noted on Revenue records. </p>  <p>  At inspection, regulatory investigators of the AMLCU verify that those being inspected are not members of a prescribed accountancy body. Membership of the organisation in the details supplied by the Deputy is not checked at inspection. However, three of those inspected in the period specifically mentioned to regulatory investigators that they were members of the organisation in the details supplied by the Deputy. </p></reply>

The maximum prison sentence for carrying a knife is five years, which is high in comparison to other common law jurisdictions, with higher potential sentences for knife-enabled crime such as theft or assault. International research points to increased sentencing not being an effective strategy for reducing knife crime. </p>  <p>  Instead, international best practice points to targeted interventions and community engagement as being the best approach to tackle knife-crime and other criminal activity that is particularly prevalent among young people. </p>  <p>  The Department will therefore also focus on analysing existing data, as well as developing new sources of data, and looking at international best practice to inform policy in this area. Officials are working to see how we can adapt elements of the Scottish and London approaches to tackling knife crime to Ireland. This work will see them engage with hospitals and education services to build a greater understanding of the problem of violent crime in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Much good work has already been done by my Department and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, operating in conjunction with local communities and other state agencies.  My Department is also helping to coordinate the roll-out of the pilot Local Community Safety Partnerships.  These partnerships are the structures proposed under the Department&rsquo;s new Community Safety Policy to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community involved. The pilots will operate at local authority administrative level and will be made up of local representatives, a range of local services, community representatives and residents.  They will be aimed at tackling a range of problems, including knife-crime at a local and community level. </p>  <p>  The forthcoming Youth Justice Strategy will also strengthen and enhance our supports and interventions for young people who are at risk of involvement in crime and anti-social behaviour.  In addressing youth offending, our goal is to support young people to stop offending and to foster socially beneficial changes to their behaviour, most especially with regard to knife-crime.  I am very conscious of the need to help rehabilitate young people who commit knife-crime, as is the Government.  My Department's review of the legislation in the area of knife-crime will be governed to a certain extent by this overall objective. </p></reply>

This will require a sustained commitment to collaborative working between State agencies and community partners, as well as a commitment to prioritise resource allocation to address factors connected to early involvement in criminal activity and more serious offending patterns. </p>  <p>  The Strategy will strengthen and expand the role of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects and other community-based initiatives, including those working with the Probation Service.  Bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime will support the objective of diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Youth Justice Strategy will provide a framework to:</p>  <p>  - prevent offending behaviour occurring;</p>  <p>  - divert children and young adults who commit a crime away from further offending and involvement with the criminal justice system;</p>  <p>  - enhance criminal justice processes, detention and post-detention measures, to provide consistent support to encourage desistance from crime and promote positive personal development for young offenders.</p></reply>

This purpose of this campaign is to reassure victims of domestic abuse that support services from State agencies and the voluntary sector are still available and accessible during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of what level of restrictions are in place. In addition to reminding victims of domestic abuse that help is &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo;, the campaign also reminds anyone concerned for their safety that the restrictions on movement do not apply to people at risk or who are removing themselves from a domestic abuse situation.</p>  <p>  To date the Department has spent &euro;401,952.56 on the Still Here campaign.</p></reply>

The IUBMR is part of a worldwide network of unrelated donor registries.</p>  <p>  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) hosts the Irish Unrelated Bone Marrow Registry (IUBMR).  Donors wishing to donate bone marrow provide a DNA sample and are then placed on a database.  As the IUBMR is hosted by the IBTS, blood group and infectious disease markers are tested at the time of donor registration.  Some registries undertake this testing at a later date.  </p>  <p>  The IUBMR performs searches (for unrelated matching donors) on behalf of St James's Hospital and Children's Health Ireland (CHI) at Crumlin and Unrelated Bone Marrow Registries worldwide.  Unlike for blood and blood components, the IBTS is not involved in the collection, processing and storage of bone marrow donations.  The collection, processing and storage of bone marrow happens in the hospital. </p>  <p>  The World Marrow Donor Association (www.wmda.info) sets out general eligibility criteria for bone marrow and blood stem cell donors, at the time of registration and also at the time of collection/harvest.  The IUBMR follows this guidance.  The IBTS has advised that men who have sex with men (MSM) who are willing to donate bone marrow can apply to join the IUBMR.</p>  <p>  If a donor on the IUBMR is selected to donate, he or she undergoes a comprehensive medical assessment by the collection centre hospital (St James's Hospital) to determine whether the donor is fit and healthy to donate.  The decision to proceed to donate depends upon this assessment and the acceptance of the donor by the recipient's transplant medical team at the other hospital.  This process is identical throughout the world.</p></reply>

The IBTS constantly keeps all deferral policies under review to ensure the ongoing safety of blood and the products derived from it. </p>  <p>  The IBTS lifted its lifelong ban on men who have sex with men (MSM) from donating blood in January 2017, when the deferral policy was reduced to a period of one year following their last sexual encounter with a man. </p>  <p>  The IBTS continues to keep this, and all of its deferral policies, under active review in the light of scientific evidence, emerging infections and international experience. </p>  <p>  The IBTS advise that a review is underway which examines the risks associated with social behaviours that may result in a deferral from blood donation due to risks of transmission of infectious diseases.

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. </p><p>The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began on the 16th of February.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

The Framework continues to provide an appropriate mechanism to guide decision-making, and it will continue to be supplemented by more detailed sectoral guidance in relation to measures that apply at each level of the Framework.</p><p>On 23 February, 2021, the Government published COVID-19 Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead which sets out how in-school education and childcare services will be reinstated in a phased manner from 1 March, with staggered return throughout March to be concluded after the Easter break on 12 April. Information on the revised plan is available here &ndash; </p><p>The public health measures recognise the need to reduce congregation and interactions between people to reduce the transmission of Covid-19. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the plan is based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. </p><p>At level 5, all non-essential retail, and all non-essential services must remain closed. Information in relation to the current public health measures in place for essential retail and essential services at level 5 is available at:-   and </p><p>Funeral, burial and related services are listed as essential under 'Administrative and Support Activities'. </p><p>The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (NO. 10) Regulations 2020 Regulation (S.I. 701 of 2020), sets out the relevant businesses or services under the current public health measures.  Statutory Instruments related to the Covid-19 pandemic are available here:  .</p></reply>

These services are provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE.  In 2010 the range of treatments provided under the Scheme was reduced in order to cap expenditure at the 2008 level of &euro;63 million. The cost in 2021 of restoring treatments which had been provided before 2010 would depend on a number of factors, including the underlying oral health of the population and the level of take-up of such services. </p>  <p>  The national approach to future oral health service provision will be informed by Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy, which was published in 2019. The aim of the policy is to develop a model of care that will enable preventative approaches to be prioritised, improve access, and support interventions appropriate to current and future oral health needs.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the challenges faced by the dental profession under Covid-19 and their concerns about the provision of services to eligible patients. I want to ensure the sustainability and viability of the DTSS contract and I have asked my officials and the HSE to bring forward proposals to address immediate concerns. In the longer term, my commitment to the profession and to the public is for a fundamental review of the contract, in keeping with Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the Department of Health, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for the Department of Health and further information is available here: .</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE.</p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February.</p><p>On 23 February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy.</p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus.

Clinical placement learning makes up 50% of these programmes. Placements, where students are immersed in the care environments enables students to develop the practical knowledge, clinical skills and professional behaviours required  to qualify and be eligible to join the professional register.  Supernumerary clinical student placements ensure learning takes place on the frontline and that the experience is gained under the supervision of a registered nurse or midwife. I want to protect their status as students and protect their graduate programme which has delivered so many benefits.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, supernumerary clinical placements for 1-3rd year nursing and midwifery students were temporarily suspended from the 18th January to support the HSE request to release senior, qualified staff employed to support student placements who had the necessary experience to help directly with the COVID-19 response. However, placements with the necessary supports in place have been gradually resuming and last  week 1,473 ( or 89%) of the 1,659 nursing and midwifery students who were due to be on clinical placement were on placement.

The &lsquo;Health Care Assistant initiative&rsquo; (whereby student nurses and midwives were offered temporary contracts to work as Health Care Assistants) began in April 2020 and ceased in August 2020. Student nurses and midwives who took part in this initiative received payment of the first point of the Health Care Assistant salary scale at that time, &euro;28,493. Also, as part of this initiative, 4th year nurses and midwives who were on paid work internship placements at that time had their contracts temporarily augmented and paid at the first point on the Health Care Assistant salary scale.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, the HSE has also added significant additional numbers of nursing, medical and support staff as part of their response to the demands COVID-19 has made on the health service. Budget 2021 has been the largest investment in the health service workforce, with a current estimated increase of 15,838 Whole-Time Equivalent staff across 2020 and 2021. This includes a significant increase in the number of nurses and midwives. Already the HSE reports that a total of 1,712 additional Whole-Time Equivalent nursing and midwifery staff were added between December 2019 and December 2020. The Pay and Numbers Strategy is currently being finalised and will confirm the total projected increase of nurses and midwives in 2021.</p>  <p>  Unlike March 2020, this significant increase in staffing numbers means the HSE is now better prepared to deal with the recent surge in admissions. My Department has made it clear to the HSE that it stands ready to provide additional supports if needed, including a similar initiative to last year&rsquo;s if required. To date, the HSE have not requested any re-opening of this initiative as part of their staffing needs.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the regular pay for 4th year student nurses on paid internship increased by 2% on 1st October 2020. The annualised salary for this group is now &euro;21,749 (or &euro;10.72 per hour) for general nursing and midwifery students and &euro;22,229 (&euro;10.96 per hour) for psychiatric nursing students.</p>  <p>  I would also like to confirm to the Deputy that a review is due to commence on long-term matters regarding supports for student nurses and midwives on clinical placements, including those on paid internship placement. My Department is currently engaging with the nursing unions on this matter and I expect this review to commence its work in the near future.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first. </p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February. </p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy.  </p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. </p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.  </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis. </p><p>Further details are available at the following link:</p></reply>

Mandatory open disclosure and external notification of notifiable incidents will equally apply to the public and private health services. </p>  <p>  A Government Decision on the 3 December 2019 approved the text of the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019, enabling it to be introduced into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 12 December 2019 where it passed the First and Second Stage. </p>  <p>  The Bill adopts a dual approach to the designation of notifiable patient safety incidents which are the subject of mandatory open disclosure.  Firstly, it lists a small number in Schedule 1 to the Bill and secondly it sets out a process by which the Minister for Health may make regulations expanding the list of notifiable patient safety incidents over time in line with advancements in clinical practice and international developments.  The Bill also sets out a process by which the Minister for Health will make regulations expanding the list of notifiable patient safety incidents over time in line with advancement in clinical practice and international developments.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Bill includes a duty of openness and transparency on health service providers.  In section 12 of the Bill a specific obligation is placed on health services providers (with an identical one placed on health practitioners) to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the patient and their family in the course of making an open disclosure of a notifiable incident. </p>  <p>  The provisions of the Bill will apply to all health services providers and health practitioners. Section 3 of the Bill explains in detail which organisations and individuals fall within the scope of the definition of health services provider.  In essence, a health services provider is intended to include public and private organisations and entities involved in providing health services, such as hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, primary care centres etc.  For the purposes of this legislation a health practitioner is defined as including registered healthcare professionals such as medical doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists, pharmacists, health and social care professionals and ambulance personnel.  </p>  <p>  Section 49 of the Bill sets out that a health services provider who fails to comply with the obligations to make an open disclosure of a notifiable patient safety incident (section 5(1), 19(9), 20(5)) to a patient and /or their relevant person, without reasonable excuse, shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.  It is open to an individual to take a case against a health services provider who they believe has failed to comply with the obligation to ensure that open disclosure took place as required by the legislation.  </p>  <p>  If a health practitioner does not engage in open disclosure as they are required to do under this legislation, then this would be a matter for the relevant health professional regulatory body ( such as the Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Board, the Dental Council and other regulatory bodies). </p>  <p>  The Bill is part of the current Programme for Government and due to go to D&aacute;il Committee Stage at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. </p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department and further information is available here: . </p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE.  </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated.

Modelling the specific impact of attendance at religious services and public worship on the R number is not in the scope of the work of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group (IEMAG), a sub-group of NPHET. It is in theory possible to &lsquo;model&rsquo; the effect of specific restrictions or policy changes on the overall reproduction number. However, in order to do so one must make a series of assumptions about the number of close contacts that occur in a setting, the number of close contacts that occur in the population as a whole, the relative risk that such close contacts lead to infection, and the effect of mitigating measures such as the use of PPE. Small changes in these assumptions lead to very different outcomes in terms of impact upon R. IEMAG is of the view that it is not feasible to provide reliable estimates of the impact on R of very specific interventions.</p><p>Technical notes on the approaches used to estimate effective reproduction number (Re) or time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) are published on the Department of Health website (). The approaches used are in line with best practice and associated references are available in the above mentioned published technical notes.</p></reply>

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  Under the NHSS, rental income is considered as &lsquo;income&rsquo; for the purpose of a financial assessment of means and is currently assessed at 80% less any allowable deductions. Assets are assessed at 7.5% of their annual value for the duration of an individual participant&rsquo;s time on the scheme, with the exception of the principal private residence, which is only assessed for the first three years. </p>  <p>  The current Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to &ldquo;reforming the Fair Deal scheme to incentivise the renting out of vacant properties&rdquo;. My Department is currently engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how to take this forward. </p>  <p>  However, there are significant complexities in relation to any changes being made to the NHSS, particularly with regard to ensuring the ongoing fair, equitable, and sustainable operation of the scheme. My Department must also be sure that any change delivers a genuine impact and offers value for money. On this basis, all competing interests and relevant issues must be fully considered.</p>  <p>  My department is liaising closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to develop an evidence base around the issue and consider potential policy measures. </p></reply>

The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 29 November 2017 as per agreed processes.  This assessment was completed on 12 December 2019 with the NCPE recommending that Dupilumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the HSE received an application for the pricing / reimbursement of Dupilumab on 13 December 2019 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned the rapid review process on 17 December 2019. Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p>  <p>  The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members and clinicians.</p>  <p>  The final decision-making authority in the HSE is the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT). The HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands it is faced with (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report and NCPE recommendations concerning Dupilumab were reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of the commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.  On 18 September 2020, the applicant company submitted representations with respect to these applications.</p>  <p>  The HSE reviewed these representations, as is required in such circumstances under the 2013 Health Act, and engaged in a meeting in November 2020 with the applicant company to discuss the submission.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the HSE Drugs Group, having reviewed the above representations at their January 2021 meeting, supported reimbursement of Dupilumab for the following defined subgroup of the full licensed indication: moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in refractory adults and adolescents 12 years and older for whom immunosuppressant treatment has failed, or is not tolerated or is contraindicated.</p>  <p>  The HSE has further advised that the HSE EMT received this recommendation and supported the reimbursement of Dupilumab under High Tech Arrangements, subject to the implementation of a managed access programme and the restriction of reimbursement to the defined subgroup which was recommended by the HSE Drugs Group.</p>  <p>  Under the 2013 Health Act, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes. Therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputies in relation to the proposed managed access programme and the formalising of a final reimbursement decision.</p></reply>

The Framework continues to provide an appropriate mechanism to guide decision-making, and it will continue to be supplemented by more detailed sectoral guidance in relation to measures that apply at each level of the Framework.</p><p>On 23 February, 2021, the Government published COVID-19 Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead which sets out how in-school education and childcare services will be reinstated in a phased manner from 1 March, with staggered return throughout March to be concluded after the Easter break on 12 April. Information on the revised plan is available here &ndash; </p><p>At Level 5, 6 guests may attend the wedding  and wedding ceremony irrespective of venue.  This does not include the persons getting married or persons attending in a professional capacity.  The various limits at all levels in the Government's Plan are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>As I'm sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.  In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading the virus to others.  </p><p>It is not possible to say what public health measures will be in place in the future.  The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET),  by my Department and by the Government . The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Details of the public health measures currently in place for weddings can be found at:- </p><p>You may also wish to note that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided guidelines for the hospitality industry which includes guidance on weddings and is available at: - </p></reply>

On the 28th December 2020 the Government approved the implementation of a new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme. The new Scheme operational from 1 January 2021 will enable persons resident in the State to access and be reimbursed for private healthcare in Northern Ireland by the HSE, provided such healthcare is publicly available within Ireland. It is intended that the scheme will operate for 12 months on an administrative basis initially, with a view to developing a general scheme to provide a statutory basis for the scheme.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE has also put in place transitional arrangements for certain patients who have a legitimate expectation of continuing to access care in the UK under the current provisions of the EU Cross-Border Directive Scheme including provision for reimbursement of healthcare costs by the HSE to persons who fall into certain categories, such as patients who can evidence that they have treatment booked prior to December 2020 for treatment in 2021. Patients are advised to contact the HSE CBD office directly with queries on individual applications and whether they are covered by the transitional arrangements or the Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  Patients also continue to have access to health services under the EU CBD Scheme in all other remaining EU/EEA countries.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Covid-19 Pandemic, persons seeking to utilise these schemes should review and adhere to the public health guidance and restrictions in place at any point in time.</p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p>  <p>  HIQA, in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing homes meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status. Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. The Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.</p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus.</p><p>The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group started in the week beginning the 15th of February.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

Furthermore, their intended use is typically in symptomatic individuals in the early stages of infection, where samples are taken, and tests conducted by trained health professionals. There is limited performance data currently available for the use of antigen tests in asymptomatic populations. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic individuals is much better than in asymptomatic individuals where data are available.</p>  <p>  While rapid Antigen Detection Tests (ADTs) are described as rapid and simple to perform, they are not designed to be delivered in large numbers and there are considerable human resource, operational, quality assurance, and clinical governance considerations in their administration. To date, validation work indicates that ADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently putting in place deployment options for the use of ADTs for specific indications in the acute hospital setting and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

The closure of the GMHS in 2020 related primarily to the necessary redeployment of increasing numbers of personnel to diverse COVID-19 related duties. Following the GMHS closure, significant efforts were made to maintain service provision.   </p>  <p>  In 2021, all health services continue to face restrictions, as the health system needs to prioritise treating those with COVID-19 and rolling out the vaccination programme. Notwithstanding these pressures, CHO6 are continuing to work to reopen the GMHS on a phased basis. The recruitment of permanent staff is progressing with administration staff in post and IT expansion under way. </p>  <p>  Existing PrEP users are being seen in the GMHS. The Clinic Consultant and other doctors are providing virtual consultations, and PrEP service users attend GMHS for STI screening and blood testing. Those with diagnosed STIs or requiring Hepatitis and/or HPV vaccine continue to be treated in GMHS also.</p>  <p>  In summary, a phased reintroduction of STI services is currently under way in GMHS.  All services are being and will continue to be delivered in accordance with current Public Health COVID guidelines. Officials from the Department of Health and the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme are in regular contact with CHO6 to monitor progress regarding the phased reopening of the GMHS. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that phone lines, the GMHS website and other resources such as www.man2man.ie and www.sexualwellbeing.ie  are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved STI and PrEP services.</p></reply>

At present all children under six years of age are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under.  The initial stage of this phased expansion will be the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 and 8.</p>  <p>  The appropriate date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context.  This date will be determined following consultation with the IMO.  It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for  my Department and further information is available here: <i></i>.</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. </p><p>The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group started in the week beginning the 15<sup>th</sup>of February. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Family carers are a diverse group, therefore, each individual will be vaccinated in the group that is appropriate to them.  </p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. </p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.</p></reply>

This determination is undertaken by Senior Medical Officers for the relevant HSE Community Health Organisation on behalf of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that following a Supreme Court decision of June 2020, the assessment process for Primary Medical Certificates was suspended at the request of the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe T.D..  Following the approval of the Finance Act 2020 which provides for the medical criteria in primary legislation, the  Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, T.D., issued an instruction to the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE to the effect that Primary Medical Certificate assessments can recommence with effect from 1st January, 2021.</p>  <p>  In the context of the national effort to suppress and manage the impact of COVID, the ability to hold assessments is impacted by, among other things, the public health restrictions in place and the role of the HSE Medical Officers in the roll out of the COVID vaccination programme.  The HSE has confirmed that the community medical doctors and their teams are predominately deployed to the COVID vaccination rollout in residential care facilities and other health care settings. </p>  <p>  I have been informed that the HSE is considering the matter of Primary Medical Certificate assessments in the context of their revision of the HSE Recovery and Restoration Plan, taking into account the pressures and challenges to the health services presented by COVID.</p>  <p>   As the issue concerning the individual case raised by the Deputy is a service matter, I have arranged to have the question referred to the HSE for consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review 2018 found that the net requirement in combination with health system reform is for an additional 2,590 hospital beds by 2031 (2,100 inpatient, 300 day case and 190 critical care). The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds (excluding critical care beds). As part of this, over 400 beds, opened in 2019/2020 on a temporary basis, will remain open on a permanent basis. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular queries raised regarding the target number of beds at the end of 2021 and the number of beds in the system on the 1st of January 2021 by site, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  Under the NHSS, rental income is considered as &lsquo;income&rsquo; for the purpose of a financial assessment of means and is currently assessed at 80% less any allowable deductions.  Assets are assessed at 7.5% of their annual value for the duration of an individual participant&rsquo;s time on the scheme, with the exception of the principal private residence, which is only assessed for the first three years. </p>  <p>  The current Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to &ldquo;reforming the Fair Deal scheme to incentivise the renting out of vacant properties&rdquo;.  My Department is currently engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how to take this forward. </p>  <p>  However, there are significant complexities in relation to any changes being made to the NHSS, particularly with regard to ensuring the ongoing fair, equitable, and  sustainable operation of the scheme. My Department must also be sure that any change delivers a genuine impact and offers value for money. On this basis, all competing  interests and relevant issues must be fully considered.   </p>  <p>  My department is liaising closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to develop an evidence base around the issue and consider potential policy measures.</p></reply>

The 2018 and 2019 Access Plans resulted in positive improvements in Inpatient and Daycase (IPDC) waiting lists which saw a reduction of 18% from 2017 to 2019, and some broader trends in improvement for GI Scopes and Outpatient (OPD) lists. The 2020 Access Plan had not been finalised for publication by March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of routine elective scheduled care for a number of months. </p>  <p>  In the context of addressing the impact of Covid-19 on scheduled care, the Government has allocated an additional &euro;210m to the HSE for access to care, which includes funding to help address the shortfall in acute hospital capacity, due to measures introduced to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, and address waiting lists. An additional &euro;30m has also been given to the NTPF to help to address backlogs in waiting lists. This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving access to care including reducing waiting times for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health, HSE and NTPF are working together to agree targets in relation to waiting list focused activity for 2021. It is expected that this work will conclude shortly. </p></reply>

Part 1A of the Schedule sets out the essential retail outlets permitted to operate, including, at paragraph 15, outlets selling food or beverages whether on a retail or wholesale basis and whether in a non-specialised or specialised outlet, insofar as they sell food or beverages on a takeaway basis or for consumption off the premises. </p><p>While there is no dedicated licence for online sales of intoxicating liquor, licensees of licensed premises may engage in online sales subject to certain restrictive conditions.</p><p>As matters stand, under existing legislation where alcohol is purchased online, the same restrictions on the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor apply, including the restrictions in relation to hours of trading and the provisions in relation to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor to young persons. </p><p>Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so. </p><p>Section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, makes provision for offences relating to the sale and delivery of alcohol products to persons under the age of 18 years. It is an offence under section 31(2) for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol products to any person for consumption off his or her licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.</p><p>It is not possible to say what public health measures will be in place in the future.  The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), by my Department and by the Government. The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p></reply>

The Framework continues to provide an appropriate mechanism to guide decision-making, and it will continue to be supplemented by more detailed sectoral guidance in relation to measures that apply at each level of the Framework.</p><p>On 23 February 2021, the Government published COVID-19 Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead which sets out how in-school education and childcare services will be reinstated in a phased manner from 1 March, with staggered return throughout March to be concluded after the Easter break on 12 April. Information on the revised plan is available here &ndash; </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>The current Covid-19 restrictions at level 5, limit the attendance at funerals to 10 mourners. Priority must  be given to families themselves in attending funerals, whether this is in the homes of the deceased or in the Funeral Home. Likewise attendance in churches and graveyards is restricted to families.</p><p>In this third wave we now sadly see a significant increase in the numbers of funerals. Concerns are being raised regarding the dangers of dropping our guard at funerals when we are at this critical time in trying to level off the deadly curve. Reports of significant numbers of people congregating in homes of bereaved persons and in funeral homes, or at churches and graveyards before or after services, are very concerning.</p><p>The inclement weather we have at this time of year can result in those lining funeral routes at times congregating in doorways of churches and other areas along the route to seek shelter. Every contact increases the risk of transmission of this highly contagious virus. Those wishing to express their condolence should do so through social media, online websites, text or card.</p><p>It is vital, despite our natural emotions and desire to be close to and hug other people, to respect the situation we find ourselves in as we try to convey our sympathies to bereaved families. It is important to remember our objectives are to reduce the spread of the virus and that we should all do what is right, even if it is different and difficult.</p><p>Further information on funerals can be found on the government website at: </p></reply>

The medical practitioner must certify this opinion and three days must elapse between certification and the procedure being carried out.</p>  <p>  Sections 9 and 10 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 set out other grounds on which termination of pregnancy is permitted in this country. Section 9 requires that two medical practitioners, having examined the pregnant woman, are of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman; the foetus has not reached viability; and it is appropriate to carry out the termination of pregnancy in order to avert the risk concerned.  One of the two medical practitioners must be an obstetrician; and the other must be an appropriate medical practitioner, and both must certify their opinions in order for the termination to be carried out.</p>  <p>  Section 10 deals with emergency situations. It provides that a termination of pregnancy may be carried out by a medical practitioner who, having examined the pregnant woman, is of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that there is an immediate risk to the life or of serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman, and it is immediately necessary to carry out the termination of pregnancy in order to avert that risk.</p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Health, to intervene in medical practice to suggest how medical practitioners treat their patients, or to dictate the practice of obstetrics. Medical practitioners are bound through professional regulatory mechanisms to operate in accordance with best medical practice.</p>  <p>  Clinical guidelines for the provision of termination of pregnancy services, within the legal framework set out in the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, have been developed by the relevant professional medical bodies.</p>  <p>  There is regular ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to facilitate the operation of the service and to resolve any operational  issues that may arise.</p></reply>

The Strategy recommends the trauma system should include one Major Trauma Centre to be based in Dublin servicing the Central Trauma Network, and another to be based in Cork University Hospital servicing the South Trauma Network.</p>  <p>  Major Trauma Centres will provide the highest level of specialist trauma care to the most severely injured patients on a single hospital site and will act as the highest point of escalation for trauma services within their respective networks. Within each network, a number of Trauma Units will deliver more general trauma care to the majority of patients who do not need the specialist expertise of a Major Trauma Centre.

The first is a supernumerary placement for 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students in their first semester with a healthcare provider, where students are not counted within the funded staffing allocation. Fundamentally, nursing and midwifery students, while on supernumerary clinical placements (which refers to the students being surplus to the rostered complement of nurses or midwives while on placement) are being educated. In line with Directive 2013/55/EU, this education is carried out on the frontline, as part of a team, across the wide variety of care settings and under supervision. That supervision is provided by qualified, experienced nurses and midwives called preceptors. Those student nurses and midwives can claim vouched travel and accommodation allowances to support them while undergoing such placements in line with HSE Circular 09/2004.</p>  <p>  I fully support the continued protection of the nurse/midwife programme of which supernumerary placements are a key component. Changing the supernumerary status of those placements to that of an employee would remove those educational protections that enable such students to learn, unencumbered by an employment contract.</p>  <p>  The second category of placement is a 36-week internship for final-year student nurses and midwives, for which they are considered a 0.5 Whole-Time Equivalent member of the workforce and for which they are already paid a salary. Following a 2% pay increase on 1 October 2020, the annualised salary for this group is now &euro;21,749 (or &euro;10.72 per hour) for general nursing and midwifery students and &euro;22,229 (&euro;10.96 per hour) for psychiatric nursing students. I also fully support the continuation of the paid work internship programme in fourth year that is in place for student nurses and midwives.</p>  <p>  I know that the pandemic has presented challenges to student nurses and midwives to continue with such placements. In recognising this and to further assist student nurses and midwives while on clinical placement, I appointed Professor Tom Collins to carry out an independent review of clinical placement allowances and I received his report on 31 December 2020. The key recommendation in his Report is to implement a &lsquo;Pandemic Placement Grant&rsquo; of &euro;100 for each supernumerary placement week during the pandemic. I have accepted the recommendations and am very keen to progress this additional support.</p>  <p>  A second, longer-term review is due to examine the accommodation and travel allowances payable to student nurses and midwives on supernumerary clinical placement, and pay for 4th-year nurses and midwives on paid internship placement. Preparatory work has commenced on this review. My Department are currently engaging with the stakeholders, including the trade unions, on finalising the terms of reference for this review and I look forward to that review progressing with its work in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus.</p><p>The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group started in the week beginning the 15<sup>th</sup>of February.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department  and further information is available here: <i>.</i></p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE.</p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February.</p><p>On 23 February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy.</p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Further details are available at the following link: <i>.</i></p></reply>

The implementation of the actions is monitored though the national oversight structures, supported by the coordinated system of monitoring, research and evaluation set out in the strategy.  </p>  <p>  The strategy is a dynamic process and provides the flexibility to introduce new measures after four years to address issues that emerge during that period.  The Department is currently undertaking a mid-term review of the 50 actions contained in the strategy. </p>  <p>  The strategy contains a number of actions to address the impact of drug-related crime and intimidation on communities, involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and community and voluntary groups. Action 42 is to strengthen the effectiveness of the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme. The Programme, developed by the National Family Support Network and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, provides a framework to allow reporting of an incident of intimidation to a nominated inspector. Additional resources have been provided to raise public awareness of the programme. The Department of Health has supported the National Family Support Network to fund a Drug Related Intimidation (DRI) Training Coordinator. As well as providing training, the coordinator will undertake an analysis of supports available to service users who have been impacted by DRI nationally. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is also supporting the Drug-Related Intimidation &amp;amp; Violence Project (DRIVE) with the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces and the HSE to establish the nature and extent of intimidation and build the capacity of service providers in communities to understand and explore options available to services users.</p>  <p>  I am very aware that criminal activity and an active illicit drug market can create an intimidating and frightening environment for families and communities.

It contains 50 actions to be delivered over the four year 2017-2020. The strategy is a dynamic process, with the flexibility to introduce new measures to address issues that emerge.  </p>  <p>  Action 36 in the strategy is to consider alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use and to make recommendations on policy options. The action was completed in 2019 with the publication of the report of the working group. On foot of the report, the Government agreed to adopt a health-lead approach to drug use, known as the health diversion programme. There are two components to the programme whereby a person in possession of drugs, determined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be for personal use, on the first occasion would be referred by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a mandatory basis to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for a health screening and brief intervention. On the second occasion, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have discretion to issue an Adult Caution. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that the health diversion programme is an important step in developing a public health approach to drug use. The programme will connect people who use drugs with health services and a pathway to recovery, avoiding a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences for people, particularly younger people. A review of the programme will take place following the first full year of implementation to ensure that it is meeting all of its aims. </p>  <p>  I intend to make the implementation and review of the health diversion programme a key action in the national drugs strategy for the period 2021-2025. I expect to shortly announce the commencement of the programme on an administrative basis in a number of locations. I encourage all stakeholders to work with me and the Department to implement and to review this public health approach.</p></reply>

This new authority will enforce EU-wide rules on prohibited unfair trading practices in the food supply chain and will have powers to enforce this Directive, penalising those who breach regulations. The NFO will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department is taking a two step approach to the establishment of the NFO. Firstly, a statutory instrument will be drafted to transpose the UTP Directive by the deadline of 1st May 2021. This will provide for an Enforcement Authority which will have the powers as currently provided for in the Directive. The legislative and operational requirements for establishing a new Office of a Food Ombudsman or equivalent that might provide for functions other than those provided for in the UTP Directive are being examined. Primary legislation will be required both to establish this new authority, and to provide for any further powers which may be given to that office.  My Department is giving this matter full priority.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that there will be a national consultation process on the functions of the NFO prior to the primary legislation being enacted.</p></reply>

This points to an actual increase in the price per kilo being achieved, but I understand that this is a result of sales being found for high grade premium stock rather than an uplift in the market.</p><p>My Department's European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme 2014-2020 provides financial supports for the sustainable development of our seafood sector.  Supports to aquaculture producers under the EMFF Programme, including for capital investment, innovation, professional advisory services and organic certification have continued to be available throughout the Pandemic and demand from producers for these grants has remained strong.</p><p>On 22 October 2020, I announced a COVID-19 Aquaculture Support Scheme under the EMFF Programme, to be administered by BIM, and designed to compensate oyster and rope mussel producers for the reduction in sales and production in 2020, compared to 2019, arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic.  The Scheme closed in November with 181 aquaculture enterprises applying.  Payments ranged from &euro;6,800 to &euro;16,300 for oyster producers and from &euro;1,300 to &euro;9,000 for rope mussel producers. Details of the status of these applications are set out in the below table:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Category </th>       <th>No. </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications Received</td>       <td>181 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications in receipt of support to date</td>       <td>135 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications currently under assessment/processing</td>       <td>21 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications deemed ineligible</td>       <td>25 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Value of payments processed in 2020</td>       <td>&euro;1,169,175.72 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The terms and conditions of the Scheme provided that it was available only to those producers who were compliant with certain legal obligations that apply to all aquaculture producers, namely compliance with their aquaculture and foreshore licences and with the requirement in law to submit economic data on their operations to Bord Iascaigh Mhara through an annual Aquaculture Production and Employment Survey.  The Scheme required that applicants must have complied with the economic data requirements for each of the three previous years, unless they were a recent entrant to the sector who would not have been in production for those three years. </p><p>I am advised by BIM that the principal reasons for applications being unsuccessful related to applicants being unable to satisfy these mandatory conditions of the Scheme, relating to their obligations in law.  In addition, some applicants had submitted multiple applications and the Scheme allowed only one application per producer.</p><p>As the Pandemic continues and its impacts on markets continue to evolve and change, I am keeping the range of supports under review, in the context of the suite of Government horizontal supports that continue to be available.</p></reply>

Restrictions on the food service market domestically, across Europe and elsewhere during the Pandemic has made it an exceptionally difficult year for the sector. The value of primary Irish seafood exports declined by 10% to &euro;521m in 2020 according to CSO data released on 15 February. This is against a backdrop of volumes decreasing by 1% over the year.  The shellfish sector particularly bore the brunt of the impact with the value of exports down by 29% to &euro;126m. As the sector is heavily dependent on the food service channel across all its main export markets, the various lockdowns implemented at different times throughout the year has resulted in a very challenging market environment.  </p>  <p>  Together with my predecessors and my officials, I have maintained close contact with seafood industry representatives throughout the Pandemic. On 9 December, I met virtually with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum where I discussed the issue of income and business supports with industry representatives. I invited the Forum to make a submission on this matter. </p>  <p>  The range of horizontal supports provided by Government have remained open to seafood enterprises throughout the Pandemic and I am aware some fishers have availed of them. As the Pandemic continues, and its impacts on markets continue to evolve and change, I am keeping the range of supports under review, in the context of the suite of Government horizontal supports that continue to be available. I would also encourage industry to work with Bord Iascaigh Mhara to develop any relevant schemes that may be possible.</p></reply>

The primary surveillance system is through tissue tagging of calves. In 2020, 725 animals were disclosed as persistently infected BVD animals. All 725 animals have been disposed of. </p><p>Of the 725 animals disclosed as PI in 2020, 616 (85 %) were disposed of within 28 days of the initial positive test. Median interval from test positive to disposal was six days.</p><p>My Department provides key supports to this industry-led programme, including financial assistance. The direct financial supports available in 2021 for BEEF HERDS: &euro;220 for beef breed animals removed with a registered date of death on AIM within 10 days of the initial test, reducing to &euro;30 if removed between 11 and 21 days after the initial test and for DAIRY HERDS: Dairy heifers and dairy cross animals: &euro;160 if removed within 10 days of the initial test, reducing to &euro;30 if removed between 11 and 21 days after the initial test.  In addition, my Department will fund any required testing and vaccination of animals in any farm restricted </p><p>Very significant progress has been made in recent years but I am keen to see BVD eradicated as a matter of urgency. The focus on the programme in 2021 and 2022 is to achieve the status of BVD free as set out the new European Animal Health Law by end of 2022. Compulsory BVD testing may then cease, however it is key that sufficient surveillance must be conducted to ensure we meet the criteria set out to prove continued BVD free status.  </p><p>Details of the 2021 programme were agreed by the BVD Implementation Group (comprising relevant stakeholders) and publicised as in previous years.  My Department issued a press release on the future pathway of the BVD programme in December 2020.  Information was released through all channels including through AHI, DAFM, Veterinary Ireland, and through the farming organisations.  A full page advertisement was taken out by AHI in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>, and Programme Key messages were distributed to all the farming press by AHI. Hard copies of the Programme Key Messages have been supplied to the tag suppliers to include in any tag delivers to herd owners.  </p></reply>

It is envisaged that the centre will provide a world class environment for the production of horses, provision of equine services, industry training and promotion.  </p>  <p>  The Board of HSI set up a sub committee of the Board to carry out the selection process to decide on the site and venue.  A detailed feasibility study for the centre was carried out.  HSI appointed an independent consultant to carry out this study following a competitive request for tender. HSI advises that the work of the sub-committee has been ongoing for 2 years and has involved the consideration of many different locations. It engaged with a range of potential sites and hired a property valuer and adviser to review property and land offerings as well as availability of property to purchase, rent or develop.</p>  <p>  The approval for such a development is for the Board of Horse Sport Ireland.  Due diligence around planning permission and future development of the site are also a matter for the Board.</p>  <p>  Regarding consultation with stakeholders, HSI indicates that it has engaged with all Olympic and Paraplegic discipline affiliates on the development / re-location proposal;  Showjumping Ireland, Eventing Ireland, Dressage Ireland and Para-equestrian Ireland.  It indicates that it has also met with its equestrian sport and recreation affiliates, ranging from the Association of Irish Riding Clubs, Riding Establishments, Mounted Games, Endurance, Irish Quarter Horse Association, Irish Pony Club, Irish Pony Society, TREC Ireland, Riding for the Disabled and Irish Shows Association to discuss the matter.  These affiliates bodies encapsulate circa 30,000 participants in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Regarding procurement, I am advised that the Procurement Directive and the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016, do not apply to public service contracts for the acquisition or rental, by whatever financial means, of land, existing buildings or other immovable property.

HSI has had the objective of having a defined headquarters, and a national training and breeding centre since its inception.  </p>  <p>  I have also been informed by Horse Sport Ireland that the proposed centre at Greenogue will offer significant benefits to the breeding sector.  There is clearly a lack of top-level performance bloodlines available in Ireland at the moment. Such bloodlines are required to make genetic gain in the show jumping discipline. The active Irish Sport Horse brood mare population is 11,900, of which less than 0.06% have competed at the highest International level show jumping. It advises that to create significant genetic improvement in a short period of time, certain measures are required.</p>  <p>  In this regard investment in advanced reproduction techniques is required.  By establishing a suitable laboratory, with skilled experienced staff, HSI advises that it can support the existing veterinary expertise in this area and make assisted reproductive services more readily available to breeders. The plans for the National Centre include such an advanced Equine Reproduction facility. This innovative facility will utilise 12 acres of the Greenogue site and will have a laboratory building, horse stabling, handling and exercise facilities.   </p>  <p>  Alongside these reproductive services the centre will also facilitate the running of breeding courses, such as Artificial Insemination technician courses. The National Centre will also be in a position to host regional breeding events, such as mare inspections and, as the facilities develop, other knowledge transfer breeding events by combining its educational, administration and reproduction facilities for breeders and interested parties alike.</p></reply>

Loans from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000 may be used for working capital and required business changes as a result of COVID-19 with loan terms up to three years. Terms include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium.</p>  <p>  I engage regularly  with the main banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agrifood businesses and have stressed the need for the banks to support and work with their customers through this challenging period.  All the banks responded to the economic disruption arising from the pandemic with announcements of flexibility for their customers.  The advice is that farmers should engage with their bank at an early stage to discuss emerging cashflow issues. </p></reply>

At this meeting, officials were given an update of the state of play of the negotiations with the UK, a presentation was given on the updated JRC study on EU catches in UK waters, there was discussion on the Commission proposals on fishing opportunities and discussions on preparations for a no-deal were resumed. </p><p>On 6th October 2020, I, along with my Ministerial colleagues in the Group of 8, met with Mr Barnier, Fisheries Commissioner and DG Mare, where we were given an update on the state of play in the EU-UK fisheries negotiations. I set out Ireland&rsquo;s position at this meeting, making it clear that Ireland was seeking that  the Task Force  stick to the mandate to maintain the status quo and use the leverage of other negotiations to support this objective.</p><p>On 27th November 2020, I, along with my Ministerial colleagues in the Group of 8, met with Mr Barnier, Fisheries Commissioner and DG Mare, where we were given an update on the state of play in the EU-UK fisheries negotiations. At this meeting, I urged Mr Barnier to stay firm on the link between the overall economic partnership and the conclusion of a fishing agreement and not to agree to any short-term arrangement on fisheries which would serve to break this link. I stressed that Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry needs a strong and stable EU/UK Fisheries agreement, and is in a particularly vulnerable position sharing our main fish stocks and our waters on three sides with the UK. I also emphasised that any outcome in the future relationship negotiations that results in a loss of quota share for the EU would be damaging to Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry. </p><p>On the 20th January 2021, I, along with my Ministerial colleagues in the Group of 8, met with Mr Barnier, Fisheries Commissioner and DG Mare, on fisheries related matters post-Brexit. At this meeting, I made it clear that Ireland considers that the transfer to the UK involves a very high share of some of our most important stocks, including mackerel and prawns. I pointed out that within the Common Fisheries Policy, Ireland contributes by providing rich fishing grounds for EU Member States, and that our Exclusive Economic Zone provides spawning and nursery grounds for many of the core stocks shared with the UK and on which the Trade and Cooperation Agreement quota package and the Common Fisheries Policy depend. I also strongly expressed disappointment that the principle of burden sharing within the EU Member States has not been adequately respected. I made clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly. Mr Barnier and the Commissioner noted Ireland&rsquo;s concern pointing out that the case made was understood. Mr Barnier advised that the UK priority was increased shares of pelagic stocks and in particular mackerel and Ireland is the largest EU share holder of this stock. </p><p>I will continue to keep the focus on this situation and use any opportunity available, to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position.</p><p>The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record).  The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, on the basis of a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU. The Hague Preferences give Ireland an increased share of traditional stocks (cod, whiting, haddock, sole and plaice) when TAC levels fall below a specified level.</p><p>Any change to the existing system of quota allocations would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This would require other Member States to give up existing quota shares. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.</p><p>The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP. The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.  At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States. </p><p>I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the upcoming review of the CFP, including the interaction with stakeholders, to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.  I have previously stated that I am committed to using all opportunities including through the review of the CFP to secure additional quota shares where possible for Irish fishers. </p></reply>

This migration brings some of the fish into the Irish 200 miles zone for part of the year. At the time we see fish in the Irish zone, there are also fish being caught in the international high seas and over a wide area from Spain to Norway. There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200 miles zone may be determined.</p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a national quota for Bluefin Tuna. The available Bluefin Tuna quota is allocated each year to Member States on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990s. At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.</p>  <p>  A small Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea Herring fishery where there can be Bluefin Tuna by-catch. In this regard, the UK also had a share of the Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota and, under the EU/UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, a share of the EU&rsquo;s Bluefin Tuna quota (0.25%) has been transferred to UK. We are seeking that this transfer to the UK is taken from the overall EU quota and is not taken from the by-catch quota available to Ireland.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland was successful, for the first time, in securing agreement that allowed countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery to contribute to the collection of scientific data. A Catch-Tag-Release science-based fishery for authorised recreational angling vessels has been in place in Ireland since 2019 and supports the collection of valuable data on the migratory patterns of Bluefin Tuna in Irish waters.</p>  <p>  The EU percentage share of the international TAC is set down and there is no likelihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU. The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU and would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This means that EU Member States, with a national quota, would have to give up a share of their allocation to Ireland. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses  particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.</p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP. The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive. At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.</p>  <p>  I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the review, including the interaction with stakeholders to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.</p></reply>

While progress has been made, there are decisions on a number of key issues still to be made, including in relation to the proposed CAP Strategic Plan. The proposed new Green Architecture which encompasses enhanced conditionality, eco-schemes and agri-environment climate measures needs to be considered in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) was the national agri-environment climate measure under the Rural Development Programme to the end of 2020. To ensure that environmental benefits achieved to date are maintained and that farmers continue to receive support, GLAS 1 and 2 participants with contracts due to expire at end 2020 were offered the option of extending their contracts for a further year. The vast majority opted to do so.</p>  <p>  As regards the successor scheme to GLAS, it is proposed that a new agri-environment climate scheme will be included in Ireland&rsquo;s new CAP Strategic Plan.</p>  <p>  Funding has also been made available for an agri-environment pilot project. It is proposed to do this as a results-based project in order to align it with the principles of the next CAP. The pilot will trial the results-based model on participating farms and will test the feasibility of up-scaling the model as part of the next national scheme. Results-based agri-environment payment schemes reward farmers for committed environmental effort by linking payments to the quality of environmental outcomes delivered. I do not expect many payments will be determined by index linking to 1994.</p>  <p>  To inform the development of the project, a public consultation was recently launched and will remain open until 26th February. Final decisions on the structure and content of the pilot will be made after the public consultation process. A summary overview document and the online consultation survey are available at gov.ie - Public Consultation on Proposed Agri-Environment Results Based Pilot Project (www.gov.ie).</p></reply>

In the meantime, the EU budget for the next seven years has been agreed, and will see an overall increase in CAP funding for Ireland. Although the amount available for direct payments is slightly reduced, this is compensated for by a bigger increase in the amount available for rural development, including a special allocation of &euro;300 million for Ireland in recognition of the challenges facing our agricultural sector.  </p>  <p>  Any reduction in the amount of Direct Payments is a matter of concern.  However, the outcome must be assessed against the original proposal of the Commission in 2018, which comprised a 15% cut in rural development expenditure and a 4% cut in direct payments. This 5% overall cut in the CAP budget would have translated into a significant loss of funding for Ireland over the 2021-2027 period. </p>  <p>  Ireland had consistently rejected proposed cuts to the CAP budget during the negotiation process, particularly given the additional environmental and climate demands being made of farmers, and the need to meet the higher levels of environment and climate ambition set out in the new EU Farm to Fork and Biodiversity Strategies.  This planned reduction has now been completely removed. </p>  <p>  The continued delivery of payments to farmers is a key priority for me in ensuring the best possible outcome for farmers from the CAP reform process.</p></reply>

By way of example, in 2020, &euro;600,000 was provided to Teagasc to develop micro-malting capacity in their laboratories in Oakpark. These important supports are in addition to direct funding which Teagasc receives from my Department annually, some of which is also directed towards the tillage sector. </p>  <p>  Both I and my Department continue to encourage tillage farmers to pursue high value food and drinks markets including malting, brewing and food oats which in the main bring higher returns to growers than traditional markets for feed grain. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has introduced a number of support measures for the tillage sector in recent years to help its competitiveness including:</p>  <p>  - a Voluntary Coupled Protein Aid Scheme providing a fund of &euro;3 million with the aim of sustaining production of plant proteins. It is proposed to continue with the VCS for the CAP transitional period for tillage farmers. Furthermore, my Department is considering the continuation of the VCS for protein crops in the next CAP.</p>  <p>  - The Tillage Capital Investment Scheme (TCIS) under TAMS II covers specific areas of investment for tillage farmers. Over &euro;16m has been paid to farmers to date under the scheme. In addition, over &euro;7m has been paid to farmers for tillage investments under the Young Farmer&rsquo;s Capital Investment Scheme as part of TAMS II.</p>  <p>  -In Budget 2021, details of an Agri-environmental initiative that is intended to encourage tillage farmers to increase soil organic carbon levels by chopping and incorporating straw from tillage crops was announced. This measure will operate on a pilot basis in the transitional period between CAP programmes and has a budget of &euro;10m.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above financial supports, my Department runs a number of important programmes  including the Crop Variety Evaluation Programme and the various Seed Certification Schemes.</p>  <p>  Significant measures have been put in place to-date to support the tillage sector but I am acutely aware of the challenges it faces.

The minimum payment under BPS is &euro;100, so once a farmer has a payment entitlement value exceeding this amount (e.g. from a fraction of an entitlement), they can receive payment under BPS. If they hold entitlements, they can apply for a permanent increase to the value of these payment entitlements, if they are below the national average. Payment entitlements can also be traded between farmers to enable them to adjust their farming businesses and to facilitate entry to direct payments. </p>  <p>  There are also several measures available under CAP Pillar II. The Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme aims to provide direct financial support to farmers who farm land in areas which have been designated as constrained. The minimum eligible area that can be applied for under ANC is three hectares. The scheme as an allocation of &euro;250m annually, and payments issue to some 100,000 farmers each year nationally. The stated objectives of the scheme include maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems which take account of environmental protection requirements. Eligibility for this scheme does not require applicants to hold BPS entitlements. </p>  <p>  New entrants may also avail of measures such as TAMs and the new results-based agri-environmental pilot. The Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme offers an attractive suite of options to suit most land types and owners. Agro-forestry provides financial support to grow trees on land being used for farming. Forestry-for-fibre allows landowners to plant fast growing trees suitable for a range of purposes, including wood panel and fuel production. The Department will shortly be preparing the next Forestry Programme, which will be open for public consultation at the appropriate time.</p>  <p>  The new CAP programme proposes a higher level of environmental ambition &ndash; and will dedicate a significant sum of direct payments to eco-schemes promoting farming practices which are beneficial to the environment and go beyond standard conditionality. These will be complementary to the programme of supports under the rural development programme for the new CAP. </p>  <p>  My Department has already held consultations on the new CAP, is currently inviting submissions on the draft scoping report for the Environmental Assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 and will hold more public consultations later this year. I welcome submission of proposals for inclusion from all parties at gov.ie - Public Consultation on draft Scoping Report for the Environmental Assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 (www.gov.ie)</p></reply>

The Fund was intended to be a targeted once-off cash injection for organisations and groups delivering critical front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fund-raised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The criteria of the scheme stated that any grants awarded would be dependent on the need identified and organisations approved for funding were prioritised on that basis.</p>  <p>  When the Stability Fund was initially established, it was envisaged that social restrictions would be in place for a limited period and grant levels allocated were based on this assumption.  It was subsequently necessary to reintroduce restrictions and in this context the majority of organisations that were approved for funding under the Stability Fund received a top-up grant. This was to support them as they continue to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on their ability to trade and fundraise normally.</p>  <p>  To date, funding of over &euro;43 million, including the additional &euro;10M in funding announced during Budget 2021, has been allocated to 600 organisations. Payment processes are being finalised. This Fund is now closed.</p>  <p>I can confirm that the organisation in question submitted an application to the Stability Fund, however they were unsuccessful as they failed to meet the eligibility criteria. In order to qualify, organisations were required to be providing specific eligible supports and services to vulnerable individuals in Ireland on or before the 1st January 2019.</p>  <p>  However, I can confirm the organisation in question is in receipt of funding from my Department.</p>  <p>  My Department currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme, or CSP, to provide local services through a social enterprise model. CSP funding is provided as a fixed contribution towards the cost of employing an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) and a manager, where warranted. The Department provides a co-funding contribution of &euro;32,000 per annum towards the cost of supporting a manager and &euro;19,033 per each FTE. The organisation in question receives annual funding of &euro;127,165 under the programme towards the cost of supporting one manager and five full-time equivalent positions.</p>  <p>  In addition, in response to the difficulties being experienced by organisations due to COVID-19, my Department developed a CSP Support Fund during 2020 totalling &euro;4.75m which assists CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll and also provides assistance for the Employers PRSI contribution, during this crisis period up to April 2021. The organisation in question was approved additional supports of &euro;10,544.81 in 2020 under the CSP Support Fund and received further additional funding of &euro;4,280.25 to cover the period January to April 2021. My Department and Pobal, who administer the programme on behalf of my Department, will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Community and Voluntary sector, Local Authorities and Local Development Companies, to support community organisations across the country as they deal with the ongoing and emerging challenges presented by COVID-19. I would encourage all groups to engage with their Local Authority and Local Development Company so that they are aware of funding opportunities as they become available. </p>  <p>  Information on all funding available through my Department can be found on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The Partnership delivers many programmes and schemes locally on behalf of Government, including SICAP, T&uacute;s, Jobs Initiative and Local Employment Services. These services are very important and provide assistance to people in the Waterford City and County area who are experiencing disadvantage and to the wider community and voluntary sector. The continuation of these services remains my priority.</p>  <p>  The Partnership is an independent company - I have no direct role or contact with the Board. Once again, I would  encourage the Partnership to continue to engage with the LCDC and the Local Authority to work to address the issues raised in the recent report prepared by Crowe Ireland.</p>  <p>  I know that Waterford City and County Council, along with both of my Departments, are monitoring the situation closely and continue to support the company, while remaining conscious of its independent status. The overall objective for all concerned is to try and ensure that vital services continue to be delivered to the people of Waterford.</p>  <p>  All protected disclosures are dealt with under the Department's protected disclosure procedures. As the deputy will be aware, given my obligations under Section 16 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 to protect the identity of a person who has made a disclosure, as well as the rights of individuals named in a protected disclosure, I am unable to provide details of any particular protected disclosure. Any communication regarding a protected disclosure is directed by my Departments to the discloser concerned.</p></reply>

I also extended the timeframe for project approvals under the current LEADER programme until 31 March 2021.</p>  <p>  As EU co-financing may become available for the Transitional Programme, this programme will be delivered through the existing Local Action Group and Implementing Partner structures, since any funding available from the EU would be on the basis of the framework applicable to the 2014-2020 LEADER programme.</p>  <p>  The Transitional Programme also provides for an increase in the aid rate for private enterprises, from 50% to 75%, thereby addressing a further commitment in the Programme for Government in relation to LEADER.</p>  <p>  Preparations for the design and delivery of the next EU LEADER programme from 2023 are expected to commence later this year. The question of the administrative structures for the delivery of the programme will be considered as part of that work, having regard, inter alia, to the provisions of the EU Regulations governing the structure of future Local Action Groups, a review of the 2014-2020 programme, and the outcome of consultations with all relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

This fund is providing up to &euro;45million of funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF) and the criteria aligned with DAF objectives to support:</p>  <p>  1.The personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; or</p>  <p>  2.The educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged; or</p>  <p>  3.Persons with a disability.</p>  <p>  My Department received 1,060 applications during the application periods. Funding of over &euro;43m, including the additional &euro;10M in funding announced during Budget 2021, has been approved to over 600 organisations to date and the payment processes for this funding remain ongoing.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;10M has been allocated to the Stability Fund as part of the Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 plan announced by the Taoiseach on Tuesday 23rd February.  Further details on how relevant organisations can apply for this funding will be available shortly.</p></reply>
