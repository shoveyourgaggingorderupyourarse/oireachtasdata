The approach I have taken in introducing Equality Budgeting is that equality budgeting is to be integrated into the existing budgetary process.  Therefore, equality budgeting is contained within the existing performance budgeting framework and utilises the processes already in place. </p>  <p>  The measures identified in the pilot related mainly to gender equality but as I outlined in my budget statement in October equality budgeting remains a priority for the coming year and I am therefore expanding the programme to further develop the gender budgeting elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. This expansion is being supported by an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group which brings expert knowledge on how best to progress this important work.  This group is comprised of expert stakeholders such as the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, IHREC, NESC, the ESRI and a number of Government Departments. </p>  <p>  The Revised Estimates Volume 2019 (REV), published last December, includes performance information across all Government Departments. To provide greater visibility on the many areas of spend that specifically address inequality, the REV includes a reference guide that collates performance indicators that directly relate to areas of equality. These indicators are classified across nine themes taking into account the various Government strategies in place to guide policy development in the area of equality, including the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.</p></reply>

Separately, the PSSA also provides processes through the Public Service Pay Commission to address recruitment and retention issues in the public service and provision to address salary scale issues for "New Entrants" to the public service.</p></reply>

Of this, &euro;59.3 billion is gross voted current expenditure, while &euro;7.3 billion is gross voted capital expenditure. Ministerial allocations, as agreed by the Government, were set out in further detail in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) published in December. </p>  <p>  The effective and efficient delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and Department. In relation to spending, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on each month against expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  At end-February, gross voted expenditure of &euro;9,787 million was &euro;141 million, or 1.4 per cent, below profile. In year-on-year terms, this is &euro;725 million (8.0%) ahead on the same period in 2018. Gross Voted Current Expenditure of &euro;9,286 million is &euro;60 million, or 0.6 per cent, below profile and up by &euro;660 million, or 7.6 per cent in year-on-year terms. Gross Voted Capital Expenditure of &euro;501 million is &euro;81 million, or 14 per cent, below profile and up by &euro;66 million, or 15.1 per cent, year-on-year.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-05a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500063#WRA01700"><p>The period immediately following the introduction of the public works contracts in 2007 was marked by a severe contraction in construction output in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008.  In addition to a number of high profile insolvencies tender, prices dropped by 30% as contractors competed to win the remaining work available.</p>  <p>  In 2014 the performance of the public works contracts was reviewed and, given the challenging tender environment preceding the review, the issue of price and its impact on the award and performance of the contract was identified.  The report published in 2014 set out a series of recommendations and specifically highlighted the need for much greater definition of a project&rsquo;s requirements so that those tendering can adequately price the project and the contracting authority can properly evaluate the prices returned in the tender.</p>  <p>  With the increase in activity in the construction sector in recent years, tender prices are recovering to a level that more realistically reflects current construction costs.  Indeed inflation in the sector is well ahead of that in the economy generally.  The challenge for Government in this context is to maintain a competitive tension in tenders to ensure that value for money is delivered for the taxpayer.  This challenge should not be underestimated given the increased investment in the sector both in terms of the NDP but also private investment.</p>  <p>  The measures that have already been introduced since 2016 to ensure contracting authorities have a better understanding of the price returned in a tender include:</p>  <p>  1. The standing of the bill of quantities was increased for the traditional contract type. This measure increases the focus of the design team in preparing more comprehensive design information that can be accurately measured for pricing purposes.  With a comprehensive price breakdown it is easier to establish where unsustainable rates may be applied.</p>  <p>  2. A mechanism to directly tender specialist works was also introduced so that these critical work elements are priced directly by the specialist market thus reducing the extent of the contract sum for which the main contractor has overall price responsibility.</p>  <p>  3. The greater use of the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) was also a recommendation in the report and while this measure does go some way to addressing the issue of low pricing, where a public body is dealing with a strong field of competent contractors their scores for quality will not vary significantly unless a targeted approach is taken with respect to the quality criteria, otherwise price will end up being the determinant.</p>  <p>  These measures will be further enhanced by requirements for the adoption of Building Information Modelling once these are finalised by the Office of Government Procurement and implemented on a phased basis across the public capital programme.</p>  <p>  In order to avail of the long standing provisions that are set down in the EU procurement directives for dealing with abnormally low tenders it is vital that projects are adequately defined so that a proper analysis of the constituent elements of the project can be undertaken.  Ambiguity in the project requirements can easily result in a price that may adequately cover the tenderer's interpretation of the tender documents but that may not not necessarily align with the contracting authority's expectations.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I have no plans to engage on public service pay negotiations outside the terms of the current agreement.</p><p>Within the framework provided by the PSSA, the Labour Court has made a recommendation and the details of the recommendation will be subject to ballot by INMO members between the 11th and 25th of March. Subject to the outcome to current discussions on contractual matters related to the Labour Court Recommendation, other nursing unions (SIPTU &amp;amp; PNA) have also indicated they will undertake ballots of their members.  </p><p>The indicative estimates of the net additional costs associated with Labour Court Recommendation LCR 21900 are as follows:</p><p>2019: &euro;10m - &euro;15m</p><p>2020: &euro;30m - &euro;35m</p><p>These estimates include the cost of the potential movement of staff to the new Enhanced Nursing Practice salary scale and other elements of the Recommendation such as the extension of the location/qualification allowance to medical and surgical areas, offset by Agency Savings and the re-configuration of the new entrant deal.</p><p>These estimates are necessarily high level and indicative reflecting the fact that further detailed work is currently under way, as provided for under the Labour Court Recommendation, in relation to a new nursing contract and supporting verification mechanisms.</p><p>On the 24th September last, agreement was reached with the Public Services Committee of ICTU on measures to address the new entrant pay issue. </p><p>In general, the agreement provides for two separate interventions which will take place at point 4 and point 8 of pay scales. The practical effect of this is that for &lsquo;new entrants&rsquo; the relevant points on the pay scale will be bypassed thereby reducing the time spent (by bypassing two increment points) on the scale for progression to the maximum point.</p><p>The benefits under the measure are effective from 1 March 2019 and are restricted to Parties adhering to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 excluding nurses, who will benefit from measures that form part of the Labour Court Recommendation.</p></reply>

The investment at Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, supported by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Capital Grants Programme, includes improvements in three separate areas: at the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne Visitor Centre, at Knowth Monument and at the core Newgrange Monument itself. </p>  <p>  The Visitor Centre acts as the admission point to Newgrange and Knowth and as a management hub for a range of nearby monuments, providing information and interpretation of these important sites. The Centre was built and the existing exhibition installed in the mid 1990's so it is timely at this stage, over 20 years after its inception, to review the exhibition and modernise it so that it provides added value to visitors and provides them with a more interactive, dynamic and engaging experience.  In tandem, the fabric of the building, which is considerably dated at this point, is being substantially refurbished and updated.</p>  <p>  The new facilities at Knowth celebrate the megalithic art at the site and will be open to visitors during the coming season. The state of the art exhibition currently being developed at the Knowth Farm buildings will explore how the art was produced as well as its significance and will for the first time allow visitors to experience in virtual reality the interior of one of the great tombs at Knowth.  Traditionally, Knowth has only been open to the public from the end of March to the beginning of November for conservation reasons.  The development at Knowth means that the site will be open to the public for much longer, leading ultimately to a year-round visitor offering at the site.</p>  <p>  The project at Newgrange Monument will focus on bringing the former Tourist Office at the site back into use together with changes to traffic management and landscaping.   This work is currently subject to a Planning Application to Meath Co. Council.   Improved interpretation at Newgrange itself will allow us to change the way in which we present the site to the public and aid the better management of visitor volumes.  Following completion of this project more visitors will be offered the chance to enjoy the site and the exterior of the tomb with entry to the tomb being treated as a &lsquo;premium&rsquo; experience. The net effect will be to sustainably increase the overall number of visitors who experience the Newgrange site. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that once all of these proposed projects have been completed, we will not only deliver a state-of-the-art entry point to the World Heritage site via Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne Visitor Centre but will also facilitate a sustainable increase in visitor numbers to the entire archaeological zone encompassed by the World Heritage Site.</p></reply>

On 11 December 2018, the Government decided to give greater immediate priority to the preparations for a no deal Brexit. This work is ongoing and includes all Government Departments and Agencies. It includes measures both nationally and in conjunction with the EU.</p>  <p>   In a no deal scenario, goods entering the EU from the UK would be treated as imports from a third country and goods leaving the EU to the UK will be treated as exports. All relevant EU legislation on imported goods and exported goods would apply, including the levy of certain duties and taxes, in accordance with EU commitments and under the rules of the World Trade Organisation. Relevant customs declarations would be needed, and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controls would need to be applied. Additional staff have been recruited for our ports and airports, and ICT systems have been enhanced to support this work.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to working with the European Commission and our EU partners to ensure that any potential disruption to connectivity as a result of necessary additional checks and controls is kept to a minimum. At the same time, Ireland is committed to protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Customs Union, membership of which is a core element of our economic strategy and has been good for Irish business. </p>  <p>  Further to agreement by Government, OPW, working with key stakeholders, are now progressing arrangements for new customs, health and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements at ports and airports. Preparatory works are ongoing in four separate locations in Rosslare to provide facilities infrastructure for staff carrying out customs, SPS and health checks in the event of a no deal Brexit.  A new export facility is being delivered within the Port and the development of new import inspection facilities will commence in the coming days.</p></reply>

In particular, an Investment Projects and Programmes Office (IPPO) has been established in the Department to support the implementation of the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and drive strengthened business case and project appraisal. In this context, and in the context of the ongoing rollout and delivery of Project Ireland 2040, my Department is also conducting a review of the provisions of the Public Spending Code, with a view to underpinning the focus upon value-for-money across all Departments and Offices in the appraisal, management and delivery of capital investment projects.</p></reply>

The cost of unitary payments for 2018 is in the region of &euro;260 million.</p>  <p>  Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are partnerships between the public and private sectors for the purpose of delivering a project or service.  Some of the advantages associated with PPPs are that they allow the public sector to avail of private sector expertise and innovation and the private partner assumes responsibility for a considerable portion of the risk.  </p>  <p>  The contracts tend to be long-term arrangements, typically spanning 25 years or more, and can be Design-Build-Finance-Maintain (DBFM), Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain (DBFOM) and Concession projects.  </p>  <p>  Design-Build-Finance-Maintain (DBFM): DBFM projects require the PPP Co to provide and maintain the asset/infrastructure but not to operate it.  This is likely to be used to provide schools and similar infrastructure; in such cases the public sector will want use of the asset but will not require that the private partner provide the attendant service, i.e. in the case of a school, the public sector or the relevant patron would employ the teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain (DBFOM): DBFOM PPPs effectively require the private sector to replace the public sector for the duration of the contract.  These PPPs require the private sector to both provide and operate the asset/infrastructure.  In the case of a water treatment plant, for example, this would require the private sector to staff the plant to ensure service delivery on behalf of the public sector contractor.</p>  <p>  Concessions: Concessions differ from other PPPs in how they provide a financial return to the private sector.  Unlike other PPPs the private sector achieves its financial return by levying a user charge on the service.  In Ireland, concessions have been used to a large extent in the transport sector.</p>  <p>  The capital cost consists of all the costs (including VAT) associated with the construction or acquisition of the physical assets to the point of it becoming available for use.  The public sector provides annual unitary payments to the private sector for a contractually agreed period of time.  These unitary payments typically comprise one or more of the following elements &ndash; usage payments, availability payments and service performance payments.  </p>  <p>  Hence, unitary payments cover more than the construction cost of the asset. They comprise the full availability payments entailed to deliver the required service level.</p></reply>

Through this process of engagement, I believe that public service pensioners have had, and continue to be afforded, a meaningful and direct means of articulating their concerns in relation to pensions and related issues.  </p>  <p>  I would again emphasise that over the past number of years there have been notable pension improvements for many public service pensioners. </p>  <p>  First, pensions in payment are benefiting significantly from the substantial reversal of the cuts to public service pensions above specified thresholds which were originally imposed by way of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) under the FEMPI legislation. </p>  <p>  Second, as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 &ndash; 2020, the Government agreed a time-limited, conditions bound, return to the non-statutory, pay-linked method of pension adjustment which prevailed until the onset of the financial emergency. To that end, in January last year, my Department issued a Circular authorising pension increases to qualifying public service pensions on foot of the pay increases covering the 2018 to 2020 period under the PSSA, as legislated for in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, both I and my Department are fully committed to maintaining the well-established dialogue with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants. Through ongoing recourse to that dialogue process, I believe that retired public servants and their representatives can be confident that their pension concerns will receive full and proper consideration, as they have done in the past.</p></reply>

The CWMF is an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.  The public works contract is a key component of the CWMF and is a lump sum, fixed-price contract which is to be used on all public works projects.  </p>  <p>  Section 7 of Circular 33/06 provides for a derogation from the use of the standard forms of contract by means of an application to the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC).  This process may be used for complex or large projects which have specific requirements which do not naturally fit with the standard lump sum contracts.</p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) commenced their formal engagement with the GCCC in May 2014 with a view to securing a derogation from the requirement to use the standard lump sum, fixed-price public works contract.  The GCCC supported the principle of the procurement and contracting strategy proposed by the NPHDB on the basis of the risk presented by a project of this scale and complexity and the programme set for the opening of the hospital.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that a derogation, if agreed, does not approve the approach or strategy of the contracting authority, but simply acknowledges that the circumstances are such as to warrant a different approach than the standard.  It is a matter for the contracting authority and the sanctioning authority to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regards to compliance with procurement rules and project appraisal in accordance with the Public Spending Code.  Accountability for the procurement strategy rests with the contracting authority.</p>  <p>  The response provided by my colleague the Minister for Health, Simon Harris T.D. to a similar question posed by the Deputy (PQ 109, 27/2/19 refers) sets out the procurement and contracting strategy that was undertaken by the NPHDB.</p></reply>

These Plans and projects are a key part of the overall flood risk management strategy set out in the National Development Plan 2017 - 2028 involving total investment of almost &euro;1 billion over the ten year time frame of that Plan.   As it is not possible to implement all of the 118 projects at the one time, a total of 50 projects were prioritised for the initial tranche of investment and delivery based on the level of risk and number of properties to be protected.</p>  <p>  Fifteen flood relief projects have been identified for County Donegal arising from the completion of the Plans.  Following consultation and discussions between the Office of Public Works (OPW) and Donegal County Council (DCC), six of the Donegal projects have been identified to be progressed in the first phase of implementation.  A joint OPW and DCC Steering Group has been established to advance these projects and plans are currently being put together to appoint consultants over the coming months for these projects. </p>  <p>  The proposed project at Buncrana and Luddan, Co. Donegal, at an estimated cost of &euro;3.3m, consists of a series of sea walls, flood embankments and flood walls, which will provide flood protection to approximately 32 properties when completed.  The proposed project is not in the first phase of projects to be progressed, but I can assure you that the OPW and Donegal County Council will work closely to ensure that it will be commenced as soon as possible in the coming years and within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.</p>  <p>  Arising from the Government decision of Tuesday, 12 February 2019 in relation to capital reallocations , the OPW is reviewing the most appropriate means of achieving the required capital savings of &euro;3 million in the flood risk management area.

The CWMF is an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.  The public works contract is a key component of the CWMF and is a lump sum, fixed-price contract which is to be used on all public works projects.  </p>  <p>  Section 7 of Circular 33/06 provides for a derogation from the use of the standard forms of contract from the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC).  This process may be used for complex or large projects which have specific requirements which do not naturally fit with the standard &lsquo;lump sum&rsquo; contracts and has been availed of by a number of sanctioning authorities.</p>  <p>  A derogation, if agreed, does not approve the approach or strategy of the contracting authority, but simply acknowledges that the circumstances are such as to warrant a different approach than the standard.  Whilst the GCCC will advise and comment on the proposed strategy it is a matter for the contracting authority and the sanctioning authority to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regards to compliance with procurement rules and project appraisal in accordance with the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  The GCCC was established under Section 11 of Circular 40/02.  It is a forum for the discussion and development of public policy in the tendering and contracting of all aspects of construction projects (apart from PPPs). </p>  <p>  The OGP provides the functions of Chair and Secretariat to the GCCC.  The membership of the GCCC includes representatives from the main capital spending bodies and departments with a significant involvement in public sector construction related activities.  </p>  <p>  Relevant departments and bodies nominate representatives with either technical or administrative backgrounds and these nominees may change from time to time.

In November 2018 my Department published a consultation paper on valuing greenhouse gas emissions in the public spending code, along with a review of the central technical appraisal parameters used in the Public Spending Code.</p><p>The paper on valuing greenhouse gas emissions concluded that the model currently in use for pricing carbon in the Public Spending Code is outdated. It proposed a new methodology that values future greenhouse gas emissions according to a shadow price of carbon that is based on the estimated marginal cost that will be faced by society in achieving Ireland&rsquo;s legally binding 2030 greenhouse gas emissions target.</p><p>In practical terms, this means a new shadow price of carbon for non-ETS emissions of &euro;32 per tonne in 2020, rising by &euro;6.80 a year to reach &euro;100 per tonne by 2030. Beyond 2030, it is proposed that the shadow price of carbon will simply rise by 5% a year. This means that the shadow price of carbon rises to &euro;128 for 2035, &euro;163 for 2040, &euro;208 for 2045 and &euro;265 for 2050.</p><p>The consultation period has now concluded and my Department is in the final stages of evaluating the responses received. It is my intention to publish a decision paper detailing my Department's response to the views received and shortly thereafter to issue a circular revising the Public Spending Code to take account of the revised shadow price of carbon. This circular will also update other technical parameters, including a downward revision of the test discount rate from 5% to 4%.</p><p>Collectively, these reforms will ensure that the Public Spending Code incorporates a more realistic appreciation of the climate consequences of all Government investment decisions. Once the circular is published the use of the revised values will be mandatory for all appraisals. This includes all appraisals of the projects detailed in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

All projects are required to complete the review stages set out in the Code before sanction is given to go to tender. This process is undertaken between the sponsoring agency and the sanctioning authority.</p>  <p>  A review of the Public Spending Code is currently underway in my Department. As elements of the review are completed, the associated updated guidance will be published. Work is ongoing on updating the requirements in relation to the different stages involved in the process of selection, appraisal, approval, and delivery of capital investment projects. This will be completed in Q1 2019.</p>  <p>  The Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) represents the tools that a public body must use to procure and manage the external resources necessary to deliver a public works project that is to be delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan. The CWMF is managed by the Office of Government Procurement in consultation with the Government Contracts Committee for Construction.</p>  <p>  The performance of a key component of the CWMF; the public works contract, was reviewed in 2014 and a series of recommendations that apply to the conditions of contract have been implemented since 2016.  The OGP is shortly to commence on a more comprehensive review of the manner in which public works projects are procured in order to develop the next generation of the CWMF.</p>  <p>  The review will incorporate consultation with industry and the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects on a broad range of issues such as risk management, information quality standards, managing price inflation and the adoption of digital technologies in project delivery.</p></reply>

Indeed Cyber Security is a standing item on the agenda of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which I chair.</p>  <p>  The response to cyber threats remains a whole-of-Government challenge, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment taking the lead role and with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the delivery of measures to improve the cyber security of the State.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is located in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, provides a range of cyber security services to owners of Government IT infrastructure and Critical National Infrastructure.  The NCSC is also home to the national Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE), which acts as a national point of contact involving entities within Ireland, and as the point of contact for international discussions on issues of cyber security.  The scope of CSIRT-IE's activities covers prevention, detection, response and mitigation services to Government Departments and State agencies and critical national infrastructure providers. The Defence Forces provide seconded specialists to assist with the work of this team when resources allow.  Also, as in any emergency/crisis situation, once Defence systems are supported, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will provide additional support to the CSIRT-IE team in so far as resources allow.</p>  <p>  From an operational perspective it would be inappropriate to comment on the cyber capability of the Defence Forces other than to say that there is ongoing development of cyber capabilities within the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961.  On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations, the award of medals for bravery is time-bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.</p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965.  A properly constituted Medals Board considered the recommendation for the award of medals and made a decision that no medals would be awarded.</p>  <p>  The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently, at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.</p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition.  In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include:</p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006.</p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006.</p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well-attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.</p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognize the brave actions of these men.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  I was delighted to present these Jadotville Medals at a ceremony that took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  Custume Barracks was the location for this event as it is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.</p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of "A" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and full and due recognition has been afforded to them in their honour.</p></reply>

The Standing Committee is reviewing each medical service individually, in order to evaluate and make recommendations regarding the most appropriate means of delivering key medical capabilities to the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a review of the Defence Forces Pharmacy Service is currently nearing completion. The objective of this review is to document and evaluate the current service provided, analyse the current and possible future demand for services and make recommendations regarding the most appropriate means of delivering pharmacy services to the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  No long-term decision will be made regarding the status of the pharmacist position in Athlone, rendered vacant upon the retirement of the incumbent pharmacist in January 2019, or pharmacy premises, pending the outcome of this review.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, personnel in three barracks are reporting to civilian pharmacies already contracted by the Defence Forces to provide an out-of-hours pharmacy service.  The barracks in question are Custume Barracks, Athlone; D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa, Galway; and Finner Camp, Donegal.  As per the terms of their contracts, each civilian pharmacy is located within 2 kilometres of the front gate of the respective barracks.</p>  <p>  There has been no change in the terms under which contracted civilian pharmacies are operating.  As above, no decision in this regard will be made until the completion of the ongoing pharmacy review.</p>  <p>  There are currently two military pharmacists serving at the rank of Commandant. These individuals are paid according to Defence Forces pay scales appropriate to their rank. There are two civilian pharmacists employed at a salary of &euro;66,817 per annum.</p>  <p>  The question as to whether or not military pharmacies fall within the definition of 'retail pharmacy', as laid out in the Pharmacy Act 2007, was finally clarified to the Defence Forces in late 2017 by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland's (PSI) Head of Regulation. The next steps are being considered as part of the Review of the Defence Forces Pharmacy Service, which is nearing completion.</p>  <p>  It must be stressed that all Defence Forces pharmacists are registered with the PSI and apply the governing rules as laid down by the PSI in relation to their day-to-day dealings with the dispensing of drugs.</p></reply>

These supporting documents must date back at least two years from the date that the application is made.</p>  <p>  A copy of valid Public Services Card issued in the applicant&rsquo;s new name can be considered as one document showing proof of usage, even if the card was issued less than 2 years ago. The PSC and the relevant issuing process, which is managed by the Department of Social Protection, is secure and robust and gives a high degree of assurance regarding the identity of the holder.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service may request additional documentary evidence and information as may be needed to establish and verify an applicant&rsquo;s identity. </p>  <p>  These rules seek to protect the integrity and security of the Irish passports against passport and identity fraud while allowing for genuine cases where name changes have occurred. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of security features within the book and the robust processes involved in its issuance.</p></reply>

The Government will also be examining the judgment closely.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach confirmed last week that the Government&rsquo;s position remains that an independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane should be established, in line with the political commitments made by the British and Irish Governments at Weston Park in 2001. The Government has made this position consistently clear to the British Government, and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  I met with the UK Minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington MP, in Dublin on 28 February and, as part of our discussions, I raised the UK Supreme Court judgment the previous day and the Government's position that an independent public inquiry is required in the Finucane case. I will also be raising the matter in my next meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP.  The Government's position will also be reaffirmed to the British Government in writing, taking account of the UK Supreme Court judgment and declaration in the Finucane case last week.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I were pleased to meet with the Finucane family in recent months to confirm the Government&rsquo;s ongoing support for their search for truth and justice. My Department remains in ongoing contact with the family at this time.</p>  <p>  My thoughts are with Geraldine Finucane and her family who have had to campaign unceasingly over the last 30 years, simply seeking to establish the full facts behind the loss of Pat - a husband, father and brother.</p>  <p>  The efforts of the Finucane family, pursued with courage, dignity and resilience, are replicated in different ways by many other families across all sections of the community, North and South, East and West, who continue to seek truth and justice following the loss of their loved ones in the dark years of the Troubles.</p>  <p>  The legacy of the past still needs to be fully addressed, and this must be done in a way that meets commitments made to all victims and survivors, including by implementing the Stormont House Agreement and by honouring the commitments made at Weston Park nearly 18 years ago.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government to seek progress with outstanding commitments and issues, to comprehensively address the legacy of the past and meet the needs and expectations of victims and survivors.</p></reply>

There are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas, which require a functioning Executive and Assembly. The devolved institutions of the Agreement are also urgently needed so that the Assembly and power-sharing Executive can represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern, including the challenges for Northern Ireland resulting from the UK decision to exit the European Union. The North South Ministerial Council is also essential to oversee and develop North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The legislation that was brought forward by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, which temporarily suspends the requirement to call an Assembly election, underlines the urgent requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to work with the Secretary of State and remain in regular contact with the leaders of each of the political parties to get the necessary political process underway to secure an agreement for a functioning Executive and Assembly and North South Ministerial Council.</p></reply>

A new roster was put in place in January 2019 following a Call for Volunteers which issued in July 2018. I am fully satisfied that the process of selection for the new roster was fair and that it was in accordance with best practice in selecting volunteer observers. Feedback from new and experienced roster members in the four training sessions held so far has been extremely positive, noting the continuing upskilling and improvement of the roster. </p><p>The intense competition for roster places allows Ireland to contribute high quality election observers, while the rotation of the roster ensures the sustainability of Ireland's international election observation.</p><p>In the interest of fairness, an appeals process was made available to unsuccessful applicants. The need for thorough consideration of one request made at a very late stage, and to procure the necessary legal advices, delayed finalisation of the appeals panel's deliberations. The appeals process has now concluded and the outcomes will be released to individual appellants imminently. The terms of reference which were established for the appeals process were attached to the response to Parliamentary Question No. 108 of 26 February 2019. The decision of the appeals panel is final.</p><p>The new election observation roster has been in operation since January. So far in 2019 members of that roster have participated in election observation missions in El Salvador, Moldova, Nigeria and Senegal. Roster members are also being nominated to participate in the forthcoming OSCE Election Observation Mission in Ukraine.</p><p>With regard to previous roster members selected by the EU or the OSCE for election monitoring missions, and further to the responses to Parliamentary Question No. 109 of 24 July 2018 and of 8 May 2013, the composite list of observers who have been nominated, selected and served on election missions in the last ten years is in the documents attached to the answer to this Parliamentary Question.  </p><p>Regarding the individual case, I refer the Deputies to the responses to Parliamentary Questions No. 80 of 30 January 2019, No. 61 of 6 February 2019 and No. 84 of 20 February 2019 and No. 87 of 26 February 2019. No request for a reasonable accommodation was received before the deadline for applications. If such a request had been received, it would have received full and thorough consideration. </p><p>I also refer the Deputies to the responses to a series of Parliamentary Questions tabled during the months of January and February which provide further information on the election observation roster, the recent roster selection process and related matters.  </p><p> </p></reply>

While initially the protests were against the worsening economic situation, they quickly developed into calls for President Omar al-Bashir&rsquo;s resignation.</p>  <p>  In reaction to the protests, schools have been closed and a state of emergency declared in some regions. Sudanese police have used tear gas and live ammunition in an attempt to disperse crowds. It is reported that over 1,000 people have been arrested across the country since protests began and that more than 50 have been killed. The use of live fire and arbitrary detention cannot be justified.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the 28 February 2019 statement by the EU High Representative expressing concern at the situation in Sudan.  This underlined the importance of an environment for political dialogue in which the Sudanese people can exercise their legitimate right to express their views. This will be essential to create the national consensus needed to find sustainable responses to Sudan's deep political and economic crisis.  In addition, Ireland also fully supports the EU statement of 11 January 2019 which calls on the Government of Sudan to release all journalists, members of the opposition, human rights defenders and other protesters arbitrarily detained, and to guarantee the independence of the Investigation Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Sudanese Director of Public Prosecutions, tasked with the investigation of abuses. </p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which is accredited to Sudan, continues to monitor the situation closely in cooperation with the Delegation of the European Union in Khartoum.</p>  <p>  In addition to the current unrest, Sudan continues to suffer from a range of humanitarian crises, driven by protracted conflicts, inequality and climate change. These feed into the popular disaffection leading to protests. This humanitarian situation has been further exacerbated by the economic crisis in 2018, leading to severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition across the country. More than 1.8 million people are internally displaced and Sudan hosts a further 1.2 million refugees that have fled conflict in neighbouring countries, the majority of whom rely on humanitarian aid for their survival. As a result, an estimated 5.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year, including 2.6 million children. Ireland is responding to these crises, with almost &euro;26 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners since 2012.</p></reply>

At the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for international development, A Better World, on the 28th February, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and I reiterated this commitment. A Better World provides the framework for this expansion.</p>  <p>  Sustained, managed increments in ODA will be required to attain this commitment. Careful planning and consultation with other Government Departments and stakeholders will also be needed to ensure it is done effectively. Recognising that the point of departure is an ODA expenditure of 0.3% of GNI, it is proposed to adopt a steady and phased approach, taking into consideration the range of demands across Government and the capacity of the public finances to meet them. In order to achieve this ambition difficult choices will be required between competing priorities, especially if economic circumstances change.</p>  <p>  The Government is already making progress, having increased allocations to ODA by 32% since 2014. Budget 2019 saw the highest increase in funding available in over a decade. Overall Irish ODA in 2019 is forecast to reach almost &euro;817 million, an increase of approximately &euro;110 million, or a 16% increase on the allocation announced in budget 2018.</p>  <p>  It will also be critical to ensure that as the ODA budget grows, Ireland works to maintain its reputation, built up over many years, for delivering high quality, untied, focused and coherent development cooperation. A Better World provides the framework for continued quality Irish Overseas Development Cooperation. Regular peer reviews by the OECD DAC provide solid evidence of this reputation and in 2018 Ireland was judged by the Overseas Development Institute to be the most efficient donor in targeting extreme poverty. </p></reply>

I attended the event on behalf of Ireland and pledged the provision of &euro;5 million for humanitarian assistance to Yemen. This brings Ireland's support to the Yemeni people to over &euro;22.5 million since 2012. </p>  <p>  Ireland's will allocate this &euro;5 million funding to the United Nation's Yemen Humanitarian Fund (YHF). The YHF provides rapid, flexible funding to NGOs and UN agencies which have the best capacity to deliver services on the ground. Services cover a range of different sectors including health, water and sanitation, nutrition and education. By incorporating the contributions of multiple donors into a single pooled fund, the YHF allows for a better coordinated response, with support targeted where there is greatest need. </p>  <p>  Ireland also contributes to global funds that allocate funding to the Yemen Crisis, including the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which provides emergency funding for UN agencies, for both rapid onset and underfunded crises; and to the Start Fund, a humanitarian pooled fund for NGOs which is supported by a number of donors. The CERF is the UN's primary mechanism for emergency response, and Yemen was the second largest recipient of CERF funding in 2018, receiving a total of $32 million. Ireland contributed &euro;12 million to the CERF in 2018, and since the establishment of the fund in 2005 has been among the top ten donors. </p>  <p>  As I stated at the Yemen Pledging Conference in Geneva, while it is vital that countries provide humanitarian support to Yemen, we must also come together as an international community to address the underlying causes of the conflict. All parties to the conflict must engage fully in the UN-led process, and implement in its entirety the Stockholm agreement.</p></reply>

The manner and practices around the detention and trial of Palestinian children in Israeli prisons and the Israeli military court system continue to be unacceptable. It is my view that Palestinians who are detained, especially children, should have the same protections and conditions that Israel affords its own citizens who are subject to detention. </p>  <p>  Ireland has recommended that Israel urgently end the admissibility of evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation. </p>  <p>  As a contracting party, Israel is bound by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). I am not satisfied that Israel is meeting its obligations under Articles 37 and 40 of the CRC and Articles 9 and 14 of the ICCPR. For example, Article 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that &ldquo;The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  During my visits to Israel and Palestine, I have personally raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the detention of minors directly with the Israeli authorities, including on the practices of night-time arrests and blindfolding. I have strongly urged the Israeli authorities to use detention only as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time, in the case of minors, as stipulated in the UN Convention. </p>  <p>  More generally, I am seriously concerned by the Israeli military court system which is used in relation to Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including children. Palestinians do not enjoy the same legal protections as Israeli settlers in the same area. These military courts have a near-one hundred percent conviction rate, a statistic which raises serious questions about the system&rsquo;s compliance with international standards of due process. </p>  <p>  Ireland has repeatedly drawn attention to concerns regarding the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and in particular, over recent years to issues related to the detention of minors. In the most recent UN Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review of Israel in 2018, Ireland drew attention to concerns in this regard. Ireland also raised the issue of administrative detention and recommended that Israel ensure full respect for international human rights obligations, in particular those specified in article 9 of the ICCPR, towards all prisoners. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also raised these issues at EU level. In February 2019, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions on EU Priorities in UN human rights fora, which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to the full implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Protocols worldwide. </p>  <p>  Ireland also provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are active in bringing the issues related to the detention of minors to light, and combatting abuses.</p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to press on these issues in the relevant multilateral fora, and also, where appropriate, directly with Israel, both with the Israeli Embassy here and through our own Embassy in Tel Aviv.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-05a.225.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500067#WRE01500"><p>I am conscious of the difficulties that the cost of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses, and that is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising investment in flood defences over the last number of years.</p>  <p>  However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which has to be based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  The above mentioned limitations means that addressing the cost and availability of flood insurance must be addressed from a different angle.  In this regard the core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management ("CFRAM") Programme. The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment ("AFAs") including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans. The Plans set out the flood relief schemes that have already been constructed and those that are currently underway. The Plans also provide the outline of 118 proposed schemes that can protect a further 11,500 properties and the evidence to prioritise their delivery to where its benefit is greatest. OPW have informed my Department  that they and Local Authorities will work closely together on all of the projects to ensure that they are  implemented in the lifetime of the Programme.  The OPW has also advised that they are working with Local Authorities to ensure these schemes are progressed within agreed timeframes. </p>  <p>  Therefore, Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems. This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance. </p>  <p>  A key part of the overall strategy is ongoing communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas. This is facilitated by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed. In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

Additionally, the Pensions Authority (PA), which is a body under the aegis of DEASP is responsible for regulating Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPs) under the IORP Directive, which governs the operation of cross-border IORPs. The PA also supervises Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) providers in relation to their approved PRSA products. </p>  <p>  Firstly, regarding Irish persons paying into approved private pension schemes in the UK, tax relief is available on contributions into and on the growth of the investment under our Exempt, Exempt, Taxed (EET) system which is set out in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Provisions to maintain this in the event of a hard Brexit are included in the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019, the so called Brexit Omnibus Bill, which is currently going through the Houses.</p>  <p>  The question of whether or not a UK Company Scheme Pension will be paid into an Irish bank account post-Brexit is a matter for the relevant scheme provider. If the pension provider is an insurance company that has not yet established in an EU/EEA as part of their contingency preparations this contract would be covered under the legislative amendments to the EU Insurance and reinsurance regulations, contained in Part 8 of the draft legislation. It may be beneficial for any concerned party to contact their personal pension provider in the first instance to clarify what contingency plans have been put in place. </p>  <p>  In relation to the making of or receiving financial payments. SEPA is the Single Euro Payments Area which enables payment transfers in euro between accounts in SEPA countries. The UK Government has committed to keeping its payment rules in line with SEPA in order to continue its access post Brexit. As stated on its website: 'There is nothing in UK private occupational pensions legislation that prevents occupational pension schemes from making pension payments overseas, We do not expect that this will change as a result of Brexit.' </p>  <p>  In the event that the UK is excluded from SEPA some additional costs may arise for transfers in euro moving between accounts in the UK and accounts in the EU, and they may take longer than they currently do. Customers should contact their finance provider where they have specific queries.</p>  <p>  Finally, the impact of Brexit, and in particular a hard Brexit, on markets and the euro/sterling exchange rate is difficult to estimate with any certainty but may have an impact on the beneficiaries of  occupational pension schemes.</p></reply>

In this regard you should note that the Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EC), which was transposed into Irish law via the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 485 of 2015) and came into force from 1 January 2016 is the framework for the regulation of insurance undertakings in Europe. Solvency II sets out new, more comprehensive EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers. It was designed to modernise supervision, deepen market integration and increase the competitiveness of European insurers.</p>  <p>  As I have no role in the day to day supervision of insurance companies, I consulted the Central Bank on the Deputy&rsquo;s query.  In response the Bank has advised that any insurance or reinsurance undertaking, including a mutual insurance company, wishing to establish its head office in Ireland and wishing to carry out the business of insurance or reinsurance must first obtain an authorisation from the Central Bank of Ireland in accordance with the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulation 2015 &ndash; S.I. No. 485 of 2015.</p>  <p>  In summary therefore in principle the same legal framework applies to a mutual insurer as applies to a non-mutual insurer.</p></reply>

I currently have no plans to re-open the scheme.</p>  <p>  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, the introduction of new tax incentive measures should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p>  <p>  The HRI was introduced in 2014 at a time when there was considerable loss of employment within the construction sector, with the aim of addressing this market failure by stimulating increased activity in the sector. In the current context of a growing economy and construction sector, the initial objectives of the scheme have been fulfilled, and this support is no longer needed in the terms in which it was originally envisaged.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in light of the current housing supply shortage, and the need to deliver 25,000 additional housing units per annum over the period 2017-2021, there is a risk that the HRI could lead to increased competition for scarce resources within the construction sector, leading to upward pressure on construction costs and house prices. The potential for displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations would create a high opportunity cost of labour associated with HRI which was not present at the inception of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that, as of 2 January 2019, the cost to the Exchequer of the HRI was c. &euro;105 million, with a further &euro;65 million worth of credits yet to be claimed in respect of the incentive. As the Deputy will appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy makes reference in the details appended to the question to homeowners claiming back VAT under the HRI. I should clarify that the incentive operated as a relief from Income Tax (albeit at a rate of 13.5%) and not VAT, for qualifying individuals who carried out repairs, renovations and improvements to a home or rental property.  </p></reply>

Consistent challenges to Revenue guidance and decisions on the VAT rating of products gave rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses. For these reasons, Revenue announced last December the decision to remove this concession with effect from 1 March 2019, which would have had the effect that all food supplements would be charged at the standard VAT rate.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has since deferred this date to 1 November 2019 in order to allow time for my Department to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplements ahead of Budget 2020.  This, in effect, means that the current VAT treatment of food supplements will remain in place. The zero rate of VAT applies to basic food supplements, such as vitamins, minerals and fish oils. All other supplements, such as those designed for cosmetic or body building purposes, apply at the standard VAT rate.</p>  <p>  Independent of Revenue&rsquo;s decisions on interpretation, I agreed during the recent Finance Bill to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group Paper to examine some of the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements.  With this in mind, and cognisant of the opinions expressed by all parties on the VAT treatment of food supplements, I propose to issue a public consultation seeking engagement from all parties on the issue.  I will also consult with my colleague the Minister for Health on the use of food supplements.  This consultation will feed into the review undertaken by the Department in the tax strategy group process.  Details on the proposed public consultation will be announced in the near future.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, parents are exempted from any income tax liability in respect of direct payments to childcare providers under the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme as operated by that Minister&rsquo;s Department. </p>  <p>  The tax code also provides certain tax reliefs and incentives in this general area including the scheme of Accelerated Capital Allowances for employers that incur capital expenditure in providing childcare facilities for use by their employees (introduced in Finance Act 2018) and the Home Carer Tax Credit. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Home Carer Tax Credit, a review of this measure will be carried out by my Department in 2019 as part of First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families (2019-2028) which was launched in November 2018. The purpose of this review will be to undertake research and analysis of the utilisation and effectiveness of the Home Carer Tax Credit, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  </p>  <p>  In relation to taxation more generally, I  have no plans at present in relation to the question of possible further income tax relief for parents for childcare services. In this regard, I note the findings of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland, which published their report in July 2015. Having considered the option of a tax credit that would be available to those who incur childcare costs, the Group recommended against introducing such a measure. The group had concerns that a tax credit would not be equitable, would have high possible deadweight, could end up being fully absorbed in the cost of childcare, and might not have a meaningful impact on a parent's decision on whether to join or to return to the labour market.</p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Working Group also made some initial estimates of the potential costs of such a tax credit based on available data. Tentative costings, based on estimates of average childcare costs per pre-primary and primary school childcare place, were applied to Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection figures on the numbers of such children in receipt of Child Benefit. If a tax credit were provided in respect of even half of these children at the standard rate of 20%, it would involve a potential cost to the Exchequer of between &euro;290 million and &euro;590 million per annum. The variation depends on the rate of take-up which is difficult to estimate. It was assumed for the purposes of that costing that all paid childcare would be covered by the relief (i.e. not just centre-based care). </p></reply>

NDP sets out the multi-annual capital funding strategy, which feeds into the normal Budgetary cycle, culminating in the Revised Estimates Volume voted by the D&aacute;il. As high-level aggregate allocations, the NDP capital envelopes have a broadly stable character; it is anticipated that updates to the overall envelopes, to take account of policy developments and to include the new incoming year of the five-year frame of reference, will be made in due course.</p></reply>

This work will involve detailed development of the measures, environmental assessment as necessary, and further public consultation, for refinement and preparation for planning/exhibition and, if and as appropriate, implementation.</p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has set up a project steering group for the Limerick City and Environs Flood Relief Scheme, comprising of OPW personnel and representatives from Limerick County Council.  The first Steering Group meeting was held in September, 2018.  The group's initial task will be to prepare a Brief for the procurement of engineering and environmental consultants to progress the design of the works and to examine all the required environmental considerations.</p><p>Once consultants are appointed to progress this Flood Relief Scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of these schemes.</p><p><b><i>Abbey River - King&rsquo;s Island FRS</i></b></p><p>Following severe flooding in Limerick City in February 2014, a commitment to funding both temporary and permanent flood defence works was given by OPW to Limerick City and County Council (LCCC).  These works formed part of the Limerick Regeneration Project.  Funding was granted to the local authority for the construction of sheet piling behind an embankment as a temporary measure with a view to the more permanent solution eventually incorporating these works. Approval was granted to the local authority in August 2015 to proceed with the development of a flood relief scheme, which will form part of the overall solution for the City.</p><p>Limerick City and County Council, with support from the OPW, are actively progressing  the flood relief scheme at Kings Island, which includes the Abbey River, at an estimated cost of &euro;26m.  The scheme will protect approximately 450 residential and 23 commercial properties.  Limerick City and County Council are scheduled to lodge planning with An Bord Ple&aacute;nala later this year with a completion date of end of 2021.</p><p>The King&rsquo;s Island Flood Relief Scheme remains a priority and the OPW has included provision for the cost of the proposed works in its financial profiles.  </p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on each month against expenditure profiles, in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-February 2019 was &euro;9,787 million. This is &euro;141 million, or 1.4% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;9,286 million, is &euro;60 million, or 0.6% below profile. Of the 17 Vote Ministerial Vote groups, 12 are below profile on current expenditure for end-February. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;501 million, is &euro;81 million, or 14% below profile and up &euro;66 million, or 15.1% on February 2018. </p>  <p>  A number of budgetary reforms have been implemented in the last number of years to improve transparency and accountability around the Budget process, while also facilitating best economic practice. This includes initiatives such as performance and equality budgeting and new publications such as the Mid-Year Expenditure Report. Sound public finances are necessary to underpin sustainable economic growth in the context of our economic recovery and to progress towards our social and economic goals. This requires effective and efficient management of overall expenditure. To support this goal, my Department has been engaging with a range of Departments on year three of the Spending Review process, with a view to reinforcing a systematic analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the third Public Service Performance Report will be published in quarter 2. This report aims to strengthen focus on what is being delivered with public funds. Performance targets are published in the Revised Estimates Volume each year. The Performance Report provides timely quantitative performance data to help to enhance the focus on performance and delivery by presenting relevant performance indicators in a dedicated, focused document.</p></reply>

Two notable examples are the establishment of a  centralised Office of Government Procurement<b></b>with responsibility (together with the key sectors of Health, Defence, Education and Local Government) for sourcing goods and services on behalf of the Public Service, and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, established to lead the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy in cooperation with departments and agencies across the Public Service. The Deputy can be assured that  public service reform remains an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy to enable us to continue to improve outcomes for the public. As regards the private sector, the Government agreed last July to develop a new and ambitious whole of Government plan to ensure our economy is well positioned for the rapidly changing global and economic environment. This initiative - Future Jobs, which will be launched shortly - will include concrete and ambitious actions to enhance productivity, ensure quality and sustainable jobs, and build sustainability and innovation into the economy.</p><p><i>Our Public Service 2020</i>&ndash; the current phase of public service reform which became operational during 2018 &ndash; represents a whole-of-public-service initiative designed to build on previous reforms while expanding the scope of reform to focus on collaboration, innovation and evaluation. <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>seeks better outcomes for the public, to support innovation and collaboration and to build public service organisations that are resilient and agile.</p><p>As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is sustainable and that Public Sector policy continues to facilitate good economic performance in the future. There are a number of budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews. The actions in <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>will also ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services over the coming years, without impacting negatively on economic performance.</p><p><i>Our Public Service 2020</i>contains an added focus on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture and in developing indicators to support an outcomes focus. With this goal in mind, within my Department we have established a Reform Evaluation Unit to focus on monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of reform as well as creating greater links between expenditure and reform.</p></reply>

A total exchequer allocation of &euro;275 million is being provided for the SSF from 2019 to 2021, plus a local authority contribution of &euro;35 million, bringing the total fund to &euro;310 million over the next three years. The SSF will fund facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites.

This figure would, of course be offset by retirements and other people leaving the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  In the Civil Service in 2019, a Clerical Officer competition for Dublin only has been advertised.  Competitions for Assistant Principal and Principal Officer may be held later in the year.</p>  <p>  Apart from competitions already advertised, it is too early to say at this stage what competitions will be held for all of 2019. Factors such as the demand from Departments/offices from existing panels, consequential vacancies arising, retirements and defined skill demands will influence decisions to hold competitions and these are currently being assessed. </p></reply>

Central to the Government&rsquo;s preparation for such challenges is the prudent management of the public finances in order to ensure that the economy remains competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  Measures being taken include balancing the books, reducing our debt burden, building up the Rainy Day Fund and continuing to invest in infrastructure.</p>  <p>   In the particular context of reform, a series of initiatives taken by this Government since 2011 have made the work of the civil and public services more transparent, decision-making more accountable and service delivery more effective and efficient. Our Public Service 2020, which became operational during 2018, is a new policy framework designed to build on these previous reforms while expanding the scope of reform to focus more on collaboration, innovation and evaluation. Progress in each of these areas, but especially innovation, will better position Ireland to meet the challenges arising in the global environment to which the Deputy refers. </p>  <p>  Certain of the eighteen specific actions set out in Our Public Service 2020, such as accelerating digital delivery of services, driving efficiency and effectiveness and promoting a culture of innovation in the public service are particularly relevant in this regard. A Public Service Leadership Board comprising Secretary General and CEO level participants from across the civil and public service has been established to drive the new reform agenda and lead on its implementation. This approach will support and enable public servants and their organisations to perform at their best and to work together to deliver high-quality, value-for-money outcomes that will benefit the economy.</p></reply>

Within the grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how these services are to be obtained. Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary or caretaker, such staff are employees of individual schools. My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. </p><p>Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process if necessary. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for School Secretaries and Caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.</p><p>The Arbitrator's recommendations were accepted by both sides. My Department has subsequently issued a number of Circulars to schools to implement and give effect to the Arbitrator's recommendation.  Accordingly, please find links below to the latest circulars in this regard:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>My Department has not been made aware of any specific instances of non-compliance with these circulars.</p></reply>

As part of the rollout of the new Framework for Junior Cycle, Geography was one of five new subject specifications that were introduced to schools in September 2018.</p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living.  It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, well-being and mental health. </p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the new Framework for Junior Cycle the status of Geography in junior cycle varied by school type.  Geography was only a core subject in voluntary secondary schools (52% of schools).</p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle, currently being rolled out, focusses on active and collaborative learning.  It gives greater flexibility and autonomy to schools in terms of subject selection, and new short courses, to tailor a student&rsquo;s learning to achieve better outcomes for that student.  Students are able to study up to 10 subjects for certification through the new Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that currently some 92% of students across all schools choose to study Geography at Junior Cycle, although it is not compulsory in all schools. </p>  <p>  This is a clear indication that in respect of subjects like geography, schools make curricular decisions in the absence of directives and we expect this to continue.  </p>  <p>  We have a dedicated cohort of geography teachers in our post-primary schools, who will be promoting the inclusion of their subject within programmes provided to students by their schools.  There is every reason to be confident that through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015 the curricular significance of Geography will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  </p>  <p>  The direction of Junior Cycle reform is consistent with practice in other high-performing education systems such as New Zealand, Queensland, Estonia and Finland, where schools have been given greater autonomy and flexibility in developing the programmes they offer.</p>  <p>  I hope you find this information useful.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area.  In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF).</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school was established in 2011 in Gorey and moved into its permanent accommodation in 2014 and the school has capacity to meet demand in the area. </p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Gorey school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

Given the multiplicity of views around what other subjects, if any, should be core, the NCCA created the 24 Statements of Learning to reflect the main priorities for learning for all students which emerged from the feedback and introduced short courses to keep the door open for &lsquo;new&rsquo; areas of learning to be introduced in schools.  Some of these statements for learning are relevant to the health and well-being of students, for example one of the statements of learning is 'takes action to safeguard and promote her/his wellbeing and that of others'.</p>  <p>  My Department is active in the area of promotion of health and well-being in schools.  The issue of promoting healthy eating is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education.  The aim is to equip students with such skills and knowledge to enable them to make appropriate choices for healthy lifestyles.</p>  <p>  Healthy Lifestyles guidance issued to post-primary schools in 2015 and primary schools in 2016.

Some 74% of those schools that responded have a facility for the sale of fresh fruit.

The Istanbul Convention is a significant legal instrument and its ratification is a Government priority.  Ratifying the Convention will send an important message that Ireland does not tolerate this violence.</p>  <p>  On 26 February 2019, the Government approved the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, subject to the enactment of the Criminal Law (Extraterritorial Jurisdiction) Bill.  This legislation was the last legislative action required under the Istanbul Convention.</p>  <p>  On 28 February, the Criminal Law (Extraterritorial Jurisdiction) Bill 2019 completed its passage through the Oireachtas and has since been signed by the President.</p>  <p>  Implementing the provisions of the Istanbul Convention involves a charge on public funds, so the approval of the D&aacute;il to its ratification must be obtained under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.  The D&aacute;il today approved ratification of the Convention, which will allow  arrangements to be made to deposit an Instrument of Ratification, signed by the T&aacute;naiste, with the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in the coming days.</p></reply>

A dynamic distribution model of resource allocation, known as the Cohort model, has been in use by Garda management since 2015 for the allocation of personnel, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College.  The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel using the Cohort Model is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements and operational strategies.  When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that it is not possible to provide the information requested for the number of Garda&iacute; that have transferred out of the Tipperary Division on promotion, to a specialist unit or without replacement.  Whilst there is a policy not to transfer a Garda from a Division without provision of a replacement, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management has the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs taking account of the Cohort model of resource allocation.</p></reply>

The Act provided that when a Judge imposed a fine, he or she could fix the amount and the time allowed for payment.  If the fine remained unpaid the fined person had to be brought back to court where the judge could then make an order for attachment of earnings, for community service or (if the fine was greater than &euro;500, a recovery order).  If the fined person did not appear for the enforcement hearing, the judge could issue a bench warrant.</p><p>Because of the extensive technical changes that had to be made to Courts Service systems, the first enforcement hearings (i.e. hearings for fixing a default because the fine wasn't paid) were not scheduled until  late 2017.  Therefore no bench warrants relating to the Fines Act were issued in 2014, 2015 or 2016.</p><p>The number of bench warrants does not equate to the number of fines.  A fined person might be summoned back to court on the same day for multiple fines. If the fined person does not  appear for the hearing, one bench warrant will issue.

However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b></b></p><p><b></b>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to allow the deployment of increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division.</p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities.  This and on-going recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions.  <b></b></p><p>The information requested by the Deputy as provided by the Garda Commissioner, is as set out in the attached table. We hope to have these figures updated on the website by the end of this week at  the link shown below.</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the link below:</p><p><table><tr><th colspan="7"><div>Divisional Probationer Garda Allocations by Division - 2015 to Jan 2019</div></th></tr><tr><td>Divisions</td><td><div>2015</div></td><td><div>2016</div></td><td><div>2017</div></td><td><div>2018</div></td><td><div>2019</div></td><td><div>Total </div></td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

The authorities here remain nonetheless very vigilant and the level of threat is kept under constant and active review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda Authorities supported by the Defence Forces have in place robust response and prevention capabilities and the authorities here work continually with their international counterparts to identify and manage threats.</p>  <p>  Deputies will appreciate that among the issues facing states is the question of suspected foreign terrorist fighters.  The shared challenges arising have been a consistent focus of discussion with my EU colleagues at meetings of Justice and Interior Ministers.  The return to states in the EU of persons who are suspected of having been active in conflict in Iraq or Syria or residing in conflict areas presents complex challenges, including questions of public protection, the prosecution of offences, the protection of citizens&rsquo; rights, particularly the rights of non-combatants, and de-radicalisation, none of which matters lend themselves to easy resolution.</p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate to comment on the detail of the security arrangements in place or, indeed, individual cases, I can assure the House that all measures necessary and consistent with the law will be taken to protect the State and the people from harm and to vindicate the rights of individuals.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific question of citizenship, it is clear that the State and all citizens are both bound by the rights and obligations that accompany citizenship.  These matters are considered on their merits on a case by case basis but the House will understand that this area of the law is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004 which set out in detail the arrangements in place in this regard, including in respect of the revocation of certificates of naturalisation where that may be considered necessary in individual cases.</p></reply>

Processing times for other Visa Offices vary but are generally within this time-frame also.</p>  <p>  More generally, a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.  This has included the assignment of additional staff to help process applications, and the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  In addition, there is regular engagement between INIS and the education sector on student visa requirements and what can mutually be done to improve the processing time with particular attention being paid to peak demand during the busy summer period.</p>  <p>  The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.   </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018) to enable the Director of the Decision Support Service to progress the preparation of the codes of practice as soon as the multi-disciplinary group submits its recommendations to the Director.   </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is not yet operational but every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the Decision Support Service has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020, the situation is being kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.  </p>  <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.</p></reply>

Garda&iacute; are working to tackle this, and all forms of criminality, in our communities to make them safer for all members of society.</p><p>While the allocation of all Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, I am advised by the Garda authorities that in early February 2019, as a result of an upsurge in anti-social activity by young persons in the Ballyfermot area, increased patrols were implemented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Assistance was also provided by a number of the youth projects and local Councillors in the area. Due to a combined effort between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a variety of youth groups and local Councillors, working with the youths allegedly involved in this activity, I am advised that the problem appears to be currently under control, but Garda&iacute; will continue to monitor this situation closely. </p><p>Similarly, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also identified hotspots in Drimnagh for public order offences including areas where youths congregate. I understand these locations are subject to regular and active Garda patrols.</p><p>I might add that a range of strong legislative provisions are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p><p>In relation to funding, I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Youth Justice Service, which operates under the auspices of my Department, provides funding to support the operation of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects. </p><p>Funding support for youth justice community interventions is based on evidence that diversion programmes, in the form of high-quality preventative intervention, can do more to reduce crime than more costly custodial options. The projects are managed by a range of Community-Based Organisations (CBO) which are required to ensure that best practice is followed in terms of quality of service and financial accountability.</p><p>The projects aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions. They are primarily targeted at 12-17 year old &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified.</p><p>However, while An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle problems in relation to anti-social behaviour head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem alone.  </p><p>Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up adults, particularly parents and guardians, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding.  These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by society in general.  We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately</p><p>To be of assistance, I am providing the Deputy with a list of Garda Youth Diversion Programmes operating in the areas highlighted in his question.  Similarly, I am also providing him with a list of projects aimed at tackling drug-related problems in communities which are funded by the Department of Health.</p><p>Garda Youth Diversion Projects in Ballyfermot, Drimnagh, Basin Street and St. Thereas&rsquo;s. </p><p>Ballyfermot </p><p>ABLE</p><p>CODY</p><p>Drimnagh </p><p>Clay</p><p>BR&Uacute;*</p><p>Basin Street </p><p>D&Aacute;N</p><p>St. Theresa&rsquo;s </p><p>D&Aacute;N</p><p>The above five projects are currently engaged with approximately 85 young people which include young people from the above mentioned areas. </p><p><i>*Note while the BR&Uacute;

In addition training lectures are being delivered to Probationer Garda&iacute; at  the Garda College in Templemore by members of the Garda National Protective   Services Bureau, prior to their postings. These presentations cover all  aspects of domestic abuse and the key aspects of the new Domestic Violence Act, including coercive control, will be added to same.

Through the mechanism of the Technical Working Group, Ireland has fully utilised the provisions of the State aid framework to enable the investment by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018. The work of the Group is ongoing and it met most recently last week in Brussels. </p>  <p>  In conjunction with DG Competition, the Group is currently working closely with DG Agriculture to explore the range of opportunities under the Agriculture and Forestry State aid guidelines, and as part of this  State Aid approval was received in February for capital investment by Enterprise Ireland in an Irish cheese producing company, Carbery Food Ingredients Ltd, to help the company towards financing a diversification project to mitigate the impacts of Brexit.</p>  <p>  On 24th January 2019, I met with the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager.  The focus of the meeting centered around the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner's team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implication become known.  The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p></reply>

The FTA was approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21st July 2011 and was formally ratified by the EU in December 2015. At the time it was the most ambitious trade agreement ever negotiated by the EU and the first with an Asian country. </p>  <p>  The majority of import duties were removed in 2011 on provisional application. With the exception of a limited number of agricultural products, the remaining tariffs were phased out over a 5-year period which concluded on 1st July 2016. The phasing out of tariffs on the remaining agricultural products is being carried out over a longer period of up to 18 years except for a small number of sensitive products which are addressed by quotas.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s trade with Korea has increased significantly since the FTA was first applied. Irish exports of goods to Korea have more than doubled from &euro;289m in 2010 to &euro;590m in 2018. Ireland&rsquo;s exports of services to Korea have more than quadrupled during the same time from &euro;209m to &euro;846m The FTA has been mutually beneficial with Korea&rsquo;s exports to Ireland also increasing.</p>  <p>  The EU-Korea FTA is overseen by the EU-Korea FTA Trade Committee co-chaired at ministerial level where the EU is represented by Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m. The main committee is supported by seven specialised committees, seven Working Groups and an Intellectual Property (IP) Dialogue.</p>  <p>  EU Agreements such as the EU-Korea FTA are very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new FTA&rsquo;s, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  My Department will publish a study later this year which examines the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from FTAs, both currently in place and in negotiation, including the EU-Korea FTA.  The objective is to deepen our understanding of how Ireland can best take advantage of these opportunities, and ensure that our businesses are prepared to access new markets.</p></reply>

Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories: Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand. </p><p>For anyone interested in starting or growing a business, the LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; support in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course); a mentor to work with the business proposer; or targeted programmes such as Lean for Micro (to help boost business productivity and competitiveness).</p><p>Micro-enterprises may also avail of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) from the LEOs. The Scheme offers the opportunity for businesses to develop their website or digital marketing strategy by availing of vouchers of up to &euro;2,500 or 50% of eligible expenditure.</p><p>Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.</p><p>I should also draw your attention to the &lsquo;Supporting SMEs&rsquo; Online Tool, which is a cross-governmental initiative to help start-ups navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible. The tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie By answering the eight questions in the Online Tool, a small business will, in one location, be able to:</p><p>- find out which of the over 170 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available to them;</p><p>- obtain information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit;</p><p>- identify their nearest Local Enterprise Office where they can discuss the outcomes of the guide further;</p><p>- download all these filtered results into a document for their further use. </p><p>InterTradeIreland (ITI) &ndash; which is jointly funded by my Department and its Northern Ireland counterpart &ndash; offers a range of business supports to SMEs designed to encourage enterprise development on an all-island basis. ITI helps businesses explore new cross border markets, develop new products, processes and services and become investor ready. Through its suite of programmes and supports, ITI provides funding, advice and contacts which help SMEs across the island that are looking to grow their business. Given its mandate to develop North South Trade, ITI is also particularly well-placed to assist businesses in preparing for the challenges associated with Brexit. ITI provides a range of Brexit supports through its Brexit Advisory Service, including a &ldquo;Start to Plan&rdquo; voucher which enables companies to access professional advice to help them plan for Brexit. Further information on ITI&rsquo;s supports and programmes is available on their website </p></reply>

The project did not look at the generic services that people with dementia and their families and carers may use, or the quality of the identified services. However, it offers a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area.</p>  <p>  The report, entitled &lsquo;Dementia Specific Services in the Community: Mapping Public and Voluntary Services&rsquo;, found gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development. This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia. It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country.</p>  <p>  The mapping exercise was conducted to complement the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, which seeks to improve dementia care, deliver improved services and supports, and allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible in their own homes and communities. While there continue to be gaps in the provision of services, the Strategy's implementation has improved supports and understanding of the challenges faced by people with dementia through the provision of dementia-specific intensive homecare packages, a programme that helps GPs and primary care teams diagnose and manage cases of dementia, and a nationwide public awareness campaign.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health also secured &euro;6.26 million through the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia. Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports; a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a model for a national dementia registry; the national rollout of a Dementia Training Programme for HSE homecare staff; the development of Dementia Resource Centres; funding for a dementia community activation coordinator; an evaluation of services for people with early onset dementia; and community support projects for people with dementia. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to the full implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, and to using available resources in the best way possible to support people with dementia, their carers and families.</p></reply>

The functions of the PSI are carried out on its behalf by the Council of the Society.  </p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 provides for an exception to the general provision in the Act which requires the sale and supply of medicines at a pharmacy to be conducted under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, and specifies that no offence is committed where a registered pharmaceutical assistant &ldquo;acts on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the registered pharmacist&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Section 30 also permits the Council to make rules as to: </p>  <p>  1. What may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and </p>  <p>  2. What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  Following a period of public consultation, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting of 20 September 2018, where the Council approved the draft rules without amendment.  Following this, the PSI undertook to redraft the Rules in relation to what may or not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist. </p>  <p>  On 6 December, the Council of the PSI approved a revised draft of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 for issuance for public consultation. This public consultation commenced on 13 December 2018 and ran until 11 January 2019, affording any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting on 14 February 2019. </p>  <p>  My role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my consent. I must consider any Rules presented to me from a fair and impartial perspective, without prejudice or prejudgment. </p>  <p>  I await the receipt of the Rules for my consideration from the PSI and, until that time, I am unfortunately not in a position to comment any further on the matter raised.</p></reply>

My Department is working on the development of draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period. </p>  <p>  A draft General Scheme of a Bill is currently with legal advisers for advice and legal quality control review. There is a current delay in accessing legal responses due to the demands of the emergency Brexit legislation. Subject to legal advice, I expect to bring the heads of bill to Government soon. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect in 2019 subject to the legislative process.</p></reply>

What may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and </p>  <p>  2. What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  Following a period of public consultation, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting of 20 September 2018, where the Council approved the draft rules without amendment.  Following this, the PSI undertook to redraft the Rules in relation to what may or not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist. </p>  <p>  On 6 December, the Council of the PSI approved a revised draft of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 for issuance for public consultation. This public consultation commenced on 13 December 2018 and ran until 11 January 2019, affording any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting on 14 February 2019. </p>  <p>  My role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my consent.

The functions of the PSI are carried out on its behalf by the Council of the Society.  </p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 provides for an exception to the general provision in the Act which requires the sale and supply of medicines at a pharmacy to be conducted under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, and specifies that no offence is committed where a registered pharmaceutical assistant &ldquo;acts on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the registered pharmacist&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Section 30 also permits the Council to make rules as to: </p>  <p>  1. What may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and </p>  <p>  2. What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  Following a period of public consultation, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting of 20 September 2018, where the Council approved the draft rules without amendment.  Following this, the PSI undertook to redraft the Rules in relation to what may or not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist. </p>  <p>  On 6 December, the Council of the PSI approved a revised draft of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 for issuance for public consultation. This public consultation commenced on 13 December 2018 and ran until 11 January 2019, affording any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting on 14 February 2019. </p>  <p>  My role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my consent. I must consider any Rules presented to me from a fair and impartial perspective, without prejudice or prejudgment. </p>  <p>  I await the receipt of the Rules for my consideration from the PSI and, until that time, I am unfortunately not in a position to comment any further on the matter raised.</p></reply>

The HSE Report was published in December 2018 by the Minister alongside a Department of Health research paper on the prevalence of Autism in Ireland. As outlined by the Minister in the Seanad second stage debate, these are key steps in developing an autism strategy as envisaged by the Bill.</p><p>The Minister has instructed the HSE to proceed with the establishment of a Programme Board who will further the implementation of the recommendations of the Review.</p><p>The HSE 2019 National Service Plan reflects this commitment and an Autism Plan is to be published in 2019.</p><p>Tony Canavan, Chief Officer will lead a national working group focused on the implementation. This builds on the substantial work already commenced in relation to improving Autism services, and the assessment process in particular.</p><p>Key priorities for the group include The Establishment of a Programme Board, Programme of Awareness Raising/Engagement and Guidance to Clinicians and Service Development.</p><p>As was also pointed out by the Minister during the debate on the Bill, the multi service needs of people with Autism are broader than the remit of the Department of Health. The Department of Justice and Equality has responsibility for providing a focal point for the promotion and co-ordination of disability policy, including the development of the National Disability Strategy.  In this context, the Department of Justice oversees the implementation of the Strategy and the accompanying Programme of Additional Actions on Autism.</p><p>Because of the actions already outlined above which will deliver an autism plan in 2019 and the unique context and nature of the current legislative programme, it is not considered necessary to advance the Senator&rsquo;s Bill at this stage.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, there is presently a focus on matters relating to Brexit, including planning and preparing in a legal and legislative context.

There are socially excluded groups who experience extreme health inequalities.  Such groups include Travellers, homeless people, refugees and asylum seekers and people with addiction issues.  Inequalities in health are reflected in the mortality and morbidity rates of the population.  Rates of chronic diseases are another indicator of health inequalities.  A social gradient is also apparent in mental health. </p>  <p>  The Department has undertaken significant measures across the health service to address the health needs of Travellers, including funding for the All Ireland Traveller Health Study.  There is ongoing and extensive engagement with Traveller organisations on their health needs. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE participate in various official structures which monitor the provision of healthcare services for Travellers.  These include the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering Committee and the Traveller Health Advisory Forum.  The Department's Healthy Ireland Network also has Traveller representatives. </p>  <p>  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) sets out over 30 actions to address the health needs of Travellers and Roma.  The Department and the HSE report regularly on the implementation of these actions to the NTRIS steering group, chaired by Minister David Stanton.  One of the NTRIS actions is for the HSE to develop and implement a detailed action plan to continue to address the specific health needs of Travellers, using a social determinants approach. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to improving the health outcomes for Travellers and I look forward to receiving from the HSE its Traveller health action plan in due course.</p></reply>

The aim of the HTA is to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of providing a PrEP programme in Ireland with a commitment to rolling out a PrEP programme in 2019. The current timeline available is that a final HTA will be sent for approval by the HIQA Board at its May meeting and that the Department of Health will shortly thereafter receive advice formally from HIQA.</p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre advises that the weekly HIV notification reports for 2018 are provisional. I remain concerned about these provisional figures that show a rise in HIV infection.</p>  <p>  The HIV Annual Report for 2017 from the Centre was published before Christmas. It is the latest annual trend data for HIV in Ireland. The report referred to 492 new diagnoses of HIV in Ireland in 2017, a rate of 10.3 per 100,000 population, representing a slight (2%) decrease between 2016 and 2017. </p>  <p>  When those with a previous HIV diagnosis abroad were excluded, the number of new diagnoses decreased by 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.</p>  <p>  The HIV Annual Report for 2017 referred to 223,609 HIV tests carried out in 13 laboratories in Ireland, giving a testing rate of 47.0 per 1,000 population. This compares to 40.5 per 1,000 in 2016 with data being provided by an extra laboratory in 2017.</p>  <p>  HIV testing is available in Ireland through a variety of services, such as opt-out antenatal and sexual health services, emergency departments, NGO&rsquo;s, drug and homeless services and primary care. </p>  <p>  Over the past 2 years, community HIV testing is expanding, in order to reach those most at risk of HIV and identify those living with undiagnosed HIV. The KnowNow community HIV testing model has expanded since the pilot in 2016, and organisations in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway have been funded to provide community HIV testing to populations at higher risk for HIV, such as Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and migrants.</p>  <p>  The HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme have a multi-faceted communications approach in response to the rise in HIV notifications. This includes the development and implementation of national campaigns such as Respectprotect on Twitter for young audiences 18-30 years and the Man2Man (.ie) website for MSM. </p>  <p>  Finally, the website sexualwellbeing (.ie) was launched in April 2018. This website aims to be the trusted source of information on sexual health and wellbeing in Ireland. The website speaks to all people living in Ireland, regardless of their sexual orientation or age/stage of adult life.</p></reply>

It underlines the agri-food sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and illustrates the potential for further development. </p>  <p>  It is the latest in series of strategies that are renewed every five years and preparations for a new strategy to 2030 are underway. Its development will involve: an analysis of a range of cross-cutting themes and the various sub-sectors of the agri-food industry; a formal public consultation; and the establishment of a committee to develop the strategy. </p>  <p>  Without pre-empting the work of the new committee and the eventual content of the 2030 strategy, it is clear that the cross-cutting themes contained in Food Wise (environmental sustainability, market development, competitiveness, innovation, and human capital) will continue to be highly relevant. It is likely that environmental sustainability, and in particular the contribution that agriculture can make to climate action, will need significant consideration and prominence. </p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is currently developing an environmental sustainability roadmap for the agri-food sector to ensure that the future development of agriculture and the land-use sector, including forestry, will be built upon and contribute fairly to Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets. This roadmap will be published later this year and will form a key element of the 2030 strategy. In parallel, my Department is also working on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan, which in line with the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals, will recognise that greater environmental and climate ambition is required.</p></reply>

For example, if a tree is located outside of a forest area and within an urban area (as defined by the Forestry Act 2014) then a tree felling licence is not required. Also, if the felling of a tree or trees is being carried out by a public authority in the course of their statutory functions, then a tree felling licence is not required.  </p>  <p>  There are also exemptions from the requirement to obtain a tree felling licence in rural areas. For example the removal of a tree within 10 metres of a public road and which, in the opinion of the owner (being an opinion formed on reasonable grounds), is dangerous to persons using the public road on account of its age or condition does not require a felling licence.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that it is the responsibility of the landowner or the person felling the tree to ensure that they are acting within the law. None of the exemptions under Section 19 of the Forestry Act 2014 serve to remove any restriction on the felling or removal of trees under (a) the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2013, (b) the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2000, and in particular section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, or (c) any other enactment.</p>  <p>  Tree felling that is carried out by public authorities is a matter for the attention of that authority and outside the remit of my Department.  Hedges or overhanging trees between neighbouring houses is a civil matter between the house holders concerned.</p>  <p>  At all times, I would advise any land owner, regardless of their location to satisfy themselves of the need to obtain a felling licence and where they are unsure, to seek advice from the Felling Section of Forestry Division, within my Department.  I would like to remind land owners that it is a criminal offence to fell trees without a valid tree felling licence, that are not exempted from the requirement and serious financial penalties can result on conviction.</p>  <p>  Decisions on forestry licence applications, including tree felling licences, are published three times weekly on my Department's website.  Furthermore, a site notice must be erected at the location where tree felling will take place, before operations commence.</p></reply>

The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan at the end of January to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors. We discussed the unique exposure of these sectors to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, as well as increased flexibility under State Aid regulations, which has already been the subject of discussions with the Commission. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves. </p>  <p>  As regards state aid limits, my Department operates the State aid rules and regulations governing the agriculture sector, where the state aid limits under the agriculture de minimis regulation are currently set at &euro;15,000 per undertaking over a rolling three year period.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the announcement by the European Commission, with effect from 14 of March 2019, that the maximum threshold limits under the agriculture de minimis regulation will increase from &euro;15,000 up to &euro;25,000.  This will allow for greater flexibility and efficiency, notably in times of crisis and situations demanding a swift response by the public authorities.  </p>  <p>  I have said that the State will not be found wanting when it comes to supporting the Irish agri-food sector and farmers to deal with the impact of Brexit.  The increase in the agriculture de minimis limits is a very important first step in this regard.</p>  <p>  Also, my Department, working in close co-operation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland, has received approval from the EU Commission for an Irish state aid application, allowing an Irish company to receive state aid funding for the diversification of its activities. The potential for this approval to act as a template for assistance for agri-food enterprises and exporter within state aid rules and regulations is currently being examined.</p></reply>

Each national ceiling will be set at 1.25% of the country's annual agricultural output over the same three-year period (up from 1% in the current rules). This is an increase in the national ceiling of 25%.</p>  <p>  If a country does not spend more than 50% of it's total national aid envelope on one particular agricultural sector, it may increase even further the de minimis aid per farm to &euro;25,000,  and the national maximum to 1.5% of the annual output. This represents a 66% increase in the ceiling per farmer and a 50% increase in the national ceiling.</p></reply>

The Scheme opened for applications on 28 March 2018 and it will remain open until 31st March 2020. To date it has provided in excess of &euro;17m in finance to over 80 SMEs, including those operating in the food sector. Further information may be found via the following link:</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme has been developed by my Department and DBEI in partnership with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the European Investment Fund (EIF).  It will be delivered through participating finance providers and make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. </p><p>This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p><p>The loans will be competitively priced, will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. There is a minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 for SMEs or &euro;50,000 for primary agriculture. The maximum loan amount is &euro;3,000,000 and loans of under &euro;500,000 will be made on an unsecured basis.</p><p>There will be &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million available initially for farmers, within an overall agri-food package of &euro;120 million. Should demand exceed these levels, this can be reviewed.</p><p>The Scheme features a two-stage application process whereby initial application is made through the SBCI website. Successful applicants are issued an eligibility reference number which can then be used in an application to one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures.  Further information including a FAQ document may be accessed on the DAFM website via the following link:  </p><p>SBCI recently issued an open call inviting banks and other lenders to become lending partners and this closed on 11 February. SBCI advise that a period of due diligence, which will include the EIF, is now under way.  I have urged SBCI to operationalise the Scheme as soon as possible. The Scheme will run for three years from its launch date and further announcements in this regard will be made shortly.</p></reply>

The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan at the end of January to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors. We discussed the unique exposure of these sectors to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, as well as increased flexibility under State Aid regulations, which has already been the subject of discussions with the Commission. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves. </p>  <p>  As regards state aid limits, my Department operates the State aid rules and regulations governing the agriculture sector, where the state aid limits under the agriculture de minimis regulation are currently set at &euro;15,000 per undertaking over a rolling three year period.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, the European Commission commenced a review of the agriculture de minimis regulation. This review took place following calls from Member States, including Ireland, for the Commission to consider increasing the agriculture de minimis threshold limits.</p>  <p>  As part of its review, the Commission launched an Inception Impact Assessment in 2017.  It highlighted the fact that European farmers had been experiencing market difficulties across the different agricultural product sectors for the previous 3 years, which led several Member States to use agriculture de minimis aid to help farmers overcome temporary liquidity gaps.  As a result, certain Member States were close to breaching their de minimis ceilings and requested an increase to those ceilings.  </p>  <p>  In 2018, the Commission consulted Member States and stakeholders to provide input by way of a Public Consultation on the revision of the de minimis rules. Those contributions were taken into account when the Commission was finalising the amendments to the Regulation.  Officials from my Department contributed to this Public Consultation and also attended meetings of the Commission&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on State Aid during 2018 where agreement on the new threshold limits was achieved.</p>  <p>   I have said that the State will not be found wanting when it comes to supporting the Irish agri-food sector and farmers to deal with the impact of Brexit.  The increase in the agriculture de minimis limits is a very important first step, and I very much welcome the recent announcement by the Commission that the threshold will increase from &euro;15,000 up to &euro;25,000 from 14 March 2019.  This will allow for greater flexibility and efficiency, notably in times of crisis and situations demanding a swift response by the public authorities.</p></reply>

While national targets exist, there are no county or regional targets. This is a national programme and therefore does not distinguish between beneficiaries on the basis of the location of the land to be planted. This has been a feature of all national Forestry Programmes to date i.e. that every landowner in the country is treated the same under the Terms and Conditions of the relevant scheme. </p>  <p>  The scheme is entirely exchequer funded and operates under State Aid rules. The legal basis for the scheme is the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020.  To halt the issuing of licences in a particular county would represent a change to the Forestry Programme.  Furthermore, any person applying for approval to plant would have a legitimate expectation that they may be permitted to do so and that they would receive the same treatment as all other applicants.  There are also existing applications at all stages in the planning system where applicants have invested time and resources in the preparation of these. Such applications were submitted in good faith and must be treated the same as any other application. In view of these considerations, it would not be appropriate or reasonable to halt the issuing of licences in any county.</p>  <p>  In terms of overall afforestation policy, I await with interest the outcome of the study on afforestation in Co. Leitrim, which was announced recently by my colleague, Minister of State, Andrew Doyle, and which will inform the local community, policy-makers and other interested parties.</p></reply>

The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. This intervention is the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. I will bring a recommendation to Government in relation to the NBP in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Deputy makes reference to the school&rsquo;s proximity to a nearby commercial deployment of high speed broadband. This deployment is part of eir's commercial roll out of high speed broadband to 300,000 predominantly rural premises, in line with a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p>  <p>  eir&rsquo;s rural investment in high speed broadband is an entirely commercial undertaking, and not part of the planned State Intervention network. Although the deployment is monitored under the terms of the Commitment Agreement, it is not funded by the State and it is not planned, designed or directed by my Department in any capacity. </p>  <p>  Decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the roll out and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis. I have no statutory role or function in such commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services.</p>  <p>  For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements.</p></reply>

I have requested a report on the options to be considered going forward in relation to the Bye Law.</p>  <p>  The Lakes in question have long been designated, as a matter of policy, for management primarily for the benefit of wild brown trout and that policy designation remains. I am advised by IFI that Stock Management Plans in respect of these lakes for 2019 have been approved by the Board of IFI. </p>  <p>  Salmon are afforded specific protection via established fisheries policy and annual conservation legislation. Ireland&rsquo;s protection of salmon is considered best in class internationally. Ireland closed its mixed stock fisheries at sea in 2007 to align fully with the EU Habitats Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles. Management is based on:</p>  <p>  - Annual scientific and management assessments of each distinct genetic salmon stock;</p>  <p>  - Ensuring harvest (by angling or commercial means) of salmon is only permitted from rivers with sustainable reproductive capacity;</p>  <p>  - Closing rivers to salmon which are below sustainable reproductive capacity;</p>  <p>  - Opening rivers to catch and release angling to ensure catch records contribute to annual assessments;</p>  <p>  - Licensing of salmon angling and commercial fishing and tagging of harvested salmon and recording/reporting of catches (angling and commercial);</p>  <p>  - Annual legislation which defines the status of each river and what if any surplus is available;</p>  <p>  - Annual legislation to regulate salmon angling and separately to regulate commercial fisheries.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is at the forefront within NASCO of ensuring that protection measures are in place by international agreement in distant feeding grounds to which salmon migrate. </p>  <p>  The salmon management regime also applies to sea-trout over 40cms in length and the potential to extend similar or other protections to other game species could be considered in the light of concerns as regards affording equal protection to such species.</p>  <p>  While management of salmon (and sea&ndash;trout over 40cms) involves multiple secondary legislation of national and local application, there is one Bye-law in relation to Pike which establishes a daily bag limit and one further Bye-law as regards coarse fish which was introduced principally to address biosecurity matters. Pike populations are managed by IFI under the long standing policy designation of certain waters. All management interventions must prudently take account of scientific assessments as is the case in salmon and sea-trout management. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) that the latest research, published in August 2018, reveals that pike appear to have changed their prey preference and now predominately eat roach. Researchers in Scotland and England have also found similar changes in pike diet. It is considered that the changes in diet are due to the invasion of roach in these waters.</p>  <p>  The research also found that pike and brown trout could live together within relatively large deep lakes with strong stream connectivity however in small, low-complex systems pike introductions could potentially impact on resident brown trout populations. The practice of pike removal and the impact it has on brown trout stocks was also examined. The findings suggest that pike removal may only be effective in protecting brown trout populations in systems where trout are the only available prey but may have little effect in systems where other prey, such as roach, is available.</p>  <p>  I am confident in IFI&rsquo;s capacity to deliver priority instream project works. IFI continues to deliver the more strategic, complex projects itself using, where necessary, appropriate external expertise. IFI takes on an enabling and supervisory role in less complex projects and this approach recognises the interest angling clubs have in habitat development. </p>  <p>  To that end, my Department has separately funded project officers for IFI to promote capacity building and a collaborative approach within the sector and to address shortfalls in expertise within voluntary organisations delivering projects. This addresses a key element of the National Strategy for Angling Development (NSAD) to build capability and improve governance across the sector and also addresses the issues and challenges raised by stakeholders at the NSAD roadshows held in 2017. </p>  <p>  The officers engage with these groups to progress projects through governance and into delivery phase. IFI has also established a pre-approved panel of experts that may be accessed by third parties who wish to engage in necessary habitat enhancement projects. </p>  <p>  During 2018 IFI and the Office of Public Works (OPW) signed an agreement to build on existing good practices and develop a framework to support high level collaboration. Both organisations have obligations to implement European and national legislation and policy. The agreement will deliver the Environmental River Enhancement Programme and focus on scientific investigations; impacts of arterial drainage maintenance on the biota and habitat with the river corridor; the potential for current strategies to provide environmental gain while securing adequate channel conveyance. All if this is to be undertaken in the context of the EU Water Framework Directive.</p></reply>

Almost two thirds of renewable energy used in Ireland comes from renewable electricity.</p>  <p>  It is widely recognised that Ireland needs to make a step change in its climate ambitions and I have secured Government approval to develop an all of Government plan which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. This Plan will include the steps which we must take in order to achieve this and I am working with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport and heat, as well as a range of other sectors.</p>  <p>  In all projected transitions to a low carbon economy by 2050, gas will continue to play a role in sustaining the transition. It plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more Co2-intensive fossil fuels. In Ireland, gas powered generation also provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation. </p>  <p>  In relation to LNG projects, commercial developers have proposed a number for development, including the Shannon LNG project and another project in Cork. Final investment decisions for these projects and compliance with any legal and regulatory requirements in relation to consents or permits are the responsibility of the project promoters. </p>  <p>  The production, sourcing, buying and selling of natural gas produced outside this jurisdiction, would also be an operational matter for the undertakings involved.

However, this changed very early on during negotiations between Member States in the Council to 2030, which became the de facto working date for negotiations. The Deputy will be well aware that negotiations such as these can be both difficult and sensitive. This is particularly true of this proposal which was supported by all Member States and led to negotiations being concluded quickly. That said, some Member States, of which Ireland was not one, indicated that the target of 90% by 2025 was unworkable. Ireland was of the view throughout that the ambition of the Directive had to be achievable by all Member States in order to be effective. It was also important that the Directive would be acceptable to and agreed by all Member States as a priority so that a new collection rate target for plastic bottles would be agreed and would deliver tangible results for European citizens before the end of the term of the current European Parliament and Commission.</p>  <p>  In that context, I was pleased to see that both a political agreement was achieved by the Member States and the European Parliament before the end of 2018 and also that the collection target has been brought forward from 2030 to 2029, as indicated in my response to Question No 499 of 2019. I recently commissioned a national study to assess how Ireland can achieve this target as soon as possible.</p></reply>

I believe this is common practice among all Member States and particularly in technical discussions of this type.</p>  <p>  In relation to consultation with Repak, the Deputy should note that Repak operates under an approval from the Minister to act as a national compliance scheme for packaging. Producers of packaging have obligations under the EU Packaging Directive, as transposed in Ireland by the European Communities (Packaging) Regulations 2014. Repak is a not for profit organisation, which carries out these regulatory obligations on behalf of their members. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of their approval, they are tasked with ensuring Ireland meets its EU targets under the Packaging Directive and to report to the Minister annually on progress. They are also obliged to keep updated on relevant regulatory developments at a national and EU level and to assist, advise and contribute to the development of Ireland&rsquo;s position on such regulatory matters.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee Report, this was shared with Repak in the interest of ensuring that the information contained therein was accurate.</p></reply>

I fully appreciate the difficulties faced by the independent broadcasting sector and my Department is working to ensure that positive changes are put in place.    To date, independent radio stations have benefited from the Sound and Vision Scheme, funded from the licence fee, which provided over &euro;494,000 towards 77 different radio projects for broadcast on independent commercial stations in 2018. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill contains a provision to allocate funding to the BAI from TV Licence receipts. This would provide up to a maximum of 50% of the annual cost of the BAI levy, in turn reducing the levy on broadcasters by up to 50%. The proposed amendment is currently at an advanced drafting stage. My Department continues to work closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in order to progress this work and ensure it is robust, with a view to having the Bill published in Q2 this year.</p></reply>

Recognising this, my Department and the EPA have sought to involve major supermarkets in reducing food waste. Aldi, BWG, Lidl, Musgrave and Tesco have all participated in my Department&rsquo;s Action Group on Food Waste. This has involved:</p>  <p>   - signing up to the &lsquo;Food Waste Charter&rsquo; thereby creating a long-term partnership between the retailer and the EPA&rsquo;s food waste prevention programme supported by my Department;</p>  <p>  - collecting and sharing food waste data to measure and manage food waste, and</p>  <p>  - signing up to the food donation network &lsquo;Foodcloud&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  'Foodcloud&rsquo; is an online platform that connects retailers and charities. Using a smartphone app, charities are alerted to the availability for collection of surplus food in local shops. This arrangement helps charities save on their food costs and ensures food is not wasted; benefitting communities and the environment. The National Waste Prevention Programme of the EPA which is funded by my Department provided key funding to Foodcloud in its start-up phase.</p>  <p>  Food donation is an important part of the response to our food waste problem as it recognises the value of food in society beyond its economic price. Given the scale of food wasted across production and consumption, donation will only ever be part of the solution and this is acknowledged by the UN, the EU and domestic stakeholders, including the charity sector. </p>  <p>  Recent revisions of EU waste legislation put increased emphasis on food waste prevention and measurement. The European Commission is exploring further food waste measures with Member States and Ireland is participating fully in emerging initiatives.</p></reply>

It is expected that the trials will conclude in April 2019 and will help to inform future purchasing decisions. </p><p>It is also noteworthy that over the past few years, the oldest and most polluting buses (Euro III- and Euro IV-classes) in the PSO fleets have been incrementally phased out and replaced with cleaner Euro VI-class buses as part of the ongoing fleet renewal programme, with corresponding decreases in emissions from the fleet as a whole. Those older diesel vehicles still remaining in the fleet will naturally be the first to be replaced as we transition towards lower emitting alternatives following July 2019. </p><p>Noting its responsibility with regards to this matter, I have referred your questions to the NTA for consideration and direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

Legislating for a stand-alone agency is an inherently complex task and the volunteer dimension of the Coast Guard's activities adds to that complexity.  The test for any such designation, given the complexity of the legislation and associated costs, is the added value it would bring.  The Coast Guard is functioning very effectively as a Division of my Department and its role is supported through various legislative instruments.  For that reason, I advised at the time that it was difficult to identify any benefit or added value for legislation of this nature.</p>  <p>  An Irish Coast Guard Authority Bill was proposed by Deputy Troy during 2018.  Once the Bill has been progressed further, I will be happy to consider the matter once again and provide my views.</p></reply>

It has functioned as a sounding board for concerns from the volunteers and provides a platform for raising issues in relation to equipment, training, procedures, etc.  The CUAG has not called for a review of the Coast Guard. </p>  <p>  On the broader question of reviewing the Coast Guard, there are various processes currently underway to address recommendations arising from the recent MCIB report into the fatal accident involving a Coast Guard boat in Kilkee and the recommendations arising from the recent AQE Report on the oversight of SAR aviation operations - all of which are relevant to the management and operation of the Irish Coast Guard.  </p>  <p>  In November, I established a Search and Rescue Framework Review Group under an external chairperson to undertake a review of the current SAR Framework document, including follow-up to the relevant MCIB recommendations.  This document sets out the roles and responsibilities of those organisations involved in SAR in Ireland and the relationships between them.  External expertise has been procured to assist the Review.  This work is progressing well and should be completed this Summer.</p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day-to- day operations of public transport.</p><p>I have explained to the House previously, that under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network.</p><p>In light of the NTA's responsibilities in this matter, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply to you.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p><p>The Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, &quot;Accessibility of Public Transport for People with Disabilities&quot;, was debated in the House on 21 February 2019. I was pleased to contribute to that Debate and also at the launch of the Committee's Report on 14 November 2018. In addition, I debated with Members of the Joint Committee and other Members of the Oireachtas, on 07 February 2018 as part of the Committee's work in preparing its Report. On each of these occasions, I outlined my policy and provided updates in relation to accessible public transport.</p><p>Accessibility features, such as wheelchair access, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage. Looking to the future, investment in public transport will be accelerated under the national development plan, (NDP). In line with recommendations in the Committee's Report, and as with all new and recently developed public transport projects, all these new programmes and projects will be fully accessible as part of the normal design. </p><p>As part of the Capital Plan Review announced in conjunction with Budget 2018, I secured an allocation of almost &euro;28 million for the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme for the four year period 2018 - 2021.  This represented a trebling of the previous allocation. Of this amount &euro;7 million is allocated for 2019. The Accessibility Retro-fit programme funds an ongoing programme of accessibility improvements to older existing public transport infrastructure and facilities, and it is managed by the NTA. The increase in funding for the retro-fit programme will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet.</p><p>Last year I asked the NTA to provide information on (i) the accessibility status of existing public transport infrastructure, (ii) the cost of making public transport services wheelchair accessible and (iii) the accessibility improvements planned with the available funding for the 4 year 2018-2021 under the Retro-fit programme.  The information provided by the NTA, and other related information, is available on my Department's website at . For the assistance of the Deputy, I have outlined in the table the cost figures provided by the NTA, of making public transport services wheelchair accessible.<table><tr><th>Bus Stations</th><th>Buses/Coaches (PSO Services)</th><th>Bus Stops (PSO coach services)</th><th>Train Stations</th><th>Taxis/Hackneys</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Bus Stations</td><td>Buses/Coaches (PSO    Services)</td><td>Bus Stops (PSO coach services)</td><td>Train Stations</td><td>Taxis/Hackneys</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;16.35 m</td><td>&euro;22.5 m</td><td>&euro;10 m</td><td>&euro;76 m</td><td>&euro;214 m</td><td>&euro;339 m</td></tr></table></p><p>I would emphasise that the figures provided by the NTA are estimates, due for example to complexities in relation providing accessible bus stops in rural/regional areas. In addition, the figures relate to Public Service Obligation (PSO) services only, and to Exchequer funding rather than industry costs in the case of Taxi/Hackneys. </p><p>I also advised the House recently that one of my priorities is to complete a review of existing public transport policy as committed to under the Programme for a Partnership Government. This review is a significant and substantial resource commitment and my Department has commenced and substantially completed the research and analysis required to inform the proposed period of public consultation which I expect to launch in the near future.</p><p>I would urge everyone, including members of the Oireachtas, to take the opportunity to contribute to this public consultation and outline their views on all aspects of public transport policy, including in relation to accessible public transport.</p></reply>

It is for this reason that any extension of the validity period has been ruled out for the time being.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's proposal that a separate renewal process be introduced for applicants over the age of 70 is also unworkable as it is not in keeping with the principles of the scheme.  Disabled parking permits are issued strictly on the basis of mobility impairment, not age, and introducing a separate renewal process would risk sending out the wrong message that the permit is an age-related entitlement.</p></reply>

A significant proportion of this funding has been targeted at families who use community childcare services, thus assisting with the sustainability issues faced by some services. The Affordable Childcare Scheme will further increase investment in childcare and will reduce the top-up many parents have to pay for their childcare. This will have corresponding benefits especially for community providers. The Affordable Childcare Scheme is also expected to increase demand for services, thereby supporting community services to operate efficiently and at full capacity. </p>  <p>   A core design feature of the Affordable Childcare Scheme is that &ldquo;money follows the child&rdquo;. Once a parent has been approved for a subsidy, they should be able to choose any registered childcare provider participating in the scheme, subject to availability, and the subsidy would then be paid directly to that provider. There could be concerns that this could reduce the sustainability of community services by increasing choice of provider. However, the underlying reasons for financial stability problems faced by some community providers does not rest with the nature of the funding model but with a wide range of other factors. Examples of these include the current inability of some parents to pay the level of fees asked of them, the broader range of family supports provided by some services in disadvantaged communities and the particular business models operated by certain services. By creating a clearer, more flexible and more user-friendly scheme, which explicitly links funding to parental income and to the costs of provision, it is intended that the Affordable Childcare Scheme will offer a vehicle for addressing some of these concerns.</p>  <p>  For services which are facing financial sustainability, my Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for community services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is currently undertaking a sustainability review which is examining the financial situation of a range of community childcare services in some of the most disadvantaged areas in Ireland. This review is also taking account of the future introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme. The review is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the year and will serve to inform any further sustainability measures or supports which may be required.</p></reply>

Child protection concerns will be dealt with by Tusla with the same degree of diligence, care and promptness for any child in need, regardless of whether they or their family are experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  Any decision to take a child into care will be based on the child&rsquo;s need for protection from harm and will take place in accordance with the thresholds set out in the Child Care Act 1991 (as amended). I would like to emphasise, as would Tusla, that homelessness is not a determining factor for children coming into care.</p>  <p>  The decision to place a child in a foster care placement with a private fostering agency, as opposed to a foster care placement provided directly by Tusla, is not determined by their housing situation prior to entering care but rather by the imperative to place the child in a foster care placement which best meets his or her needs.</p>  <p>  Tusla have informed me that they have not undertaken comparative analysis of the numbers of children being taken into care in circumstances where their families are or are not experiencing homelessness. Tusla information systems collate data under the categories of harm set out in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children; that is, neglect, physical abuse, and so on. Tusla does not collect data on the housing situation of children prior to entry into care.</p>  <p>  This Government recognises that homelessness is an extremely distressing situation for any family, and living in emergency accommodation is not conducive to normal family life. While ultimate responsibility for managing homelessness rests with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, my Department and Tusla are working to provide supports for families in emergency accommodation in order to mitigate the challenges faced by parents and children in this situation. </p></reply>

The majority of alternative care services are provided directly by Tusla. </p>  <p>  When a child comes into care the most important issue for Tusla is identifying a foster carer who can meet the unique needs of that child. This can result in a child being placed with a foster carer from a non-statutory fostering service, where this is in their best interests. The majority of foster carers in Ireland, 89% or 3,851, are recruited, assessed and supported by Tusla. There are currently 5,554 children in foster care in Ireland, of which 10% are placed with non-statutory foster care agencies. It should be noted that Tusla's local fostering committees are the approval body for all foster care placements, including those recruited by private foster care companies. Children placed with private foster care companies are allocated a Tusla social worker. </p>  <p>  Tusla utilises the services of private providers for different reasons. In some Tusla areas there may be a shortage of foster carers for demographic reasons, or there may be a need for specialist services to meet the needs of an individual child. These factors can result in the need to source foster placements from private fostering agencies. </p>  <p>  In my formal response to the Chair of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the publication of the report on foster care, I noted that Tusla is carrying out a procurement exercise to ensure that the private foster care services have been procured in accordance with procurement objectives, which incorporate value for money as well as service quality objectives. </p>  <p>  In 2018 a procurement process was initiated to ensure that the commissioning of the service was in line with financial regulations and represented best value for money. The process, however, failed to deliver any providers. Tusla has initiated a new tendering process for private foster care overall, including provision of a link worker, supervision of staff etc.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised by Tusla that best value will lie in the ability of the Agency to recruit foster carers in suitable locations with the appropriate capacity to care for the small number of children not currently fostered within the statutory provision. </p>  <p>  Recruitment of foster carers is an ongoing and prioritised activity within the Agency. This work is resourced by Tusla and includes funding fostering services in 17 Tusla areas, funding of recruitment material (such as leaflets, posters) and also media campaigns (radio, newspaper advertisements). In 2018, work was carried out to review this recruitment activity nationally, and to ensure that future recruitment is evidence informed about what works best in identifying potential foster carers. To further enhance this work, four additional posts are being funded, in addition to existing fostering resources, to support the recruitment of foster carers.  A national working group has also been established to review all recruitment activity across the country, to ensure all efforts are being taken to recruit a diverse range of foster carers to meet the diverse range of needs for children requiring foster care.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs believes that our approach to compliance and  supporting services  strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.</p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes  is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment. It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo; , the most recent of which was published on 9th   August 2018. Compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Because subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (and not enrolment), this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. </p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that community childcare settings, such as that referenced, provide a critical service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate their stated concerns regarding their sustainability. Hence, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules. </p>  <p>  My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. </p>  <p>   Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far. I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City / County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.</p>  <p>  I should also emphasise that as an FRC, some activities may be eligible for funding from elsewhere, rather than from childcare programmes per se, for example after school work related to literacy and numeracy may be eligible for funding under the Schools Completion Programme. </p>  <p>  The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the Affordable Childcare Scheme. In the coming weeks my Department will begin to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it. The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling  &euro;575m per year. Community services access much of this growing investment. Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly) assisting services to review their business model to meet compliance requirements. The Affordable Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade, This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies , Young Children and their Families, I published last November. </p></reply>

This measure refines developments introduced in 2016 and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a previous average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years) delivering fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p>  <p>  This new measure addresses the previous situation with regard to multiple entry points whereby there was a broad fluctuation in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of (between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child) and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children. The situation where there was more than one entry point created a perception of inequality to some parents when they considered the variance in the number of weeks of ECCE provision, dependant on their entry point.</p>  <p>  The minimum age was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early learning and care in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios. The upper age limit for the ECCE programme remains the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they will be 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year).</p>  <p>  It must be noted that age limits have been used to determine eligibility since the inception of the ECCE programme in 2010. </p>  <p>  Some children will not be able to commence their ECCE in September of the programme year as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st   August. However, they will be able to commence ECCE the following September and continue for a further year from September of the next programme year. Parents of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at age 4 rather than 5 years and may therefore choose to avail of one year of ECCE only. However, it is important to note that this is a parental choice and that the overall policy change has ensured that two programme years are available to all children. </p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness, it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied evenly. An essential component of the ECCE programme rules is an eligibility start date to ensure that the programme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  There are no immediate plans to revise the ECCE rules beyond the changes which were introduced in September 2018.</p></reply>

It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  The Scheme will ultimately replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme, providing both universal and targeted childcare subsidies.  To make the transition to the new scheme as smooth as possible, families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme once it launches (targeted for October 2019) or can remain on their current childcare subsidy programme for one final year. </p>  <p>  With regard to income-based subsidies awarded under the Scheme, parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 40 hours per week).  The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; will be set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and will be comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements.   </p>  <p>  Parents who do not qualify for an enhanced hours subsidy may still qualify for a standard-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 15 hours per week).  This approach reflects the evidence on the strong benefits of early childhood care and education for young children and, particularly, those from disadvantaged backgrounds but also, the evidence that these benefits are &ndash; in most cases &ndash; realised with part-time participation. The cap of 15 hours will provide for continuity between the Affordable Childcare Scheme and the ECCE scheme, whereby it will be possible for a child to commence subsidised sessional care before the age of 3 and to continue in such care without disruption or a change of hours as they transition into the ECCE scheme. </p>  <p>  Families with high levels of need, who require childcare for child welfare, child protection or family support reasons, may be referred for childcare support by a specified &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; body.  Where such a referral is made, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor without having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements.  There is no general minimum or maximum age limit for a child who is the subject of a referral by a sponsor.  However, sponsor bodies will adhere to strict criteria for qualification for referral as set out in Agreements made under section 14 of the Childcare Support Act 2018.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is currently undertaking a Sustainability Review of a range of community childcare providers in some of the most disadvantaged areas in Ireland.  The impact of the standard hours subsidy limit of 15 hours is one of the items being considered as part of this review.  The review is due to be completed in quarter 2 of this year and will inform any future policy developments in this area. </p></reply>

In discharging its statutory responsibility, Tusla supports 16 Rape Crisis Centres by providing services for individuals who have experienced sexual violence.</p>  <p>  Since taking up office, in 2016, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have prioritised the development of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) services. This has been reflected in the level of additional funding provided to Tusla for these services.</p>  <p>  In 2017, Tusla provided &euro;22.1 million in funding to domestic, sexual and gender based violence services, an increase of &euro;1.5m over 2016 funding. This level of funding was increased by &euro;1.7m in 2018, bringing the total level of funding for DSGBV services to &euro;23.8m. This funding was increased again in 2019, this time by &euro;1.5m bringing the total level of funding to &euro;25.3m. </p>  <p>  Additional funding in 2019 will support the development of enhanced domestic, sexual and gender based violence services, including continued implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) and the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (2016 &ndash; 2021). </p>  <p>  Tusla is responsible for the provision of services, and allocates funding to individual DSGBV organisations throughout the country. The distribution of funding to individual Rape Crisis Centres is determined by Tusla following an assessment of service demands throughout the country. Tusla has conducted, and continues to conduct, regional needs analysis projects in order to ascertain the greatest needs within a particular area for DSGBV services.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised me that it has a mechanism in place to enable services to apply for additional funding to increase their service provision. The mechanism requires that a business case is made and evidence is provided for both the need for additional service provision, and the organisation's capacity for additional service development. Applications are considered within budget constraints and in line with commissioning priorities. Tusla has advised that it also engages proactively with funded organisations to allocate resources for service developments.</p>  <p>  Tusla has developed considerable expertise in this area and I support the continued development of sexual violence services in Ireland, as evidenced by the increased funding provided since 2016.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs believes that our approach to compliance and  supporting services  strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.</p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes  is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment. It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo; , the most recent of which was published on 9th   August 2018. Compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Because subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (not enrolment), this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. </p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that community childcare settings, provide a valuable service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate their stated concerns regarding their sustainability. Hence, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules. </p>  <p>  My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. </p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far. I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City / County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.</p>  <p>  The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the Affordable Childcare Scheme. In the coming weeks my Department will begin to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it. The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented117% over the last four budgets, now totalling  &euro;575m per year. Community services access much of this growing investment. Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly) and co-payments / top-up payments made by parents has decreased, both measures assisting many services to strengthen their sustainability and review their business model to meet compliance requirements. </p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade.  This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies , Young Children and their Families, I published last November. </p></reply>

The levying of commercial rates is the responsibility of the Valuations Office, which falls under the ageis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, I understand that the Valuation Act, 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Under Schedule 4, paragraph 22, community childcare facilities are exempt from commercial rates, by virtue of the fact that they operate on a not-for-profit basis. The Valuations Office have also advised that, under Schedule 4 paragraph 10, facilities who provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme (ECCE) only are exempt from commercial rates.  All other childcare providers are, therefore, rateable.</p>  <p>  The issue of commercial rates is one that has been raised by the early learning and care sector, in particular through the National Early Years Forum, which I established in 2016.  My Department has therefore taken a number of steps to pursue this matter, including meeting with relevant officials to explore the possibility of obtaining an exemption of the application of commercial rates to private childcare providers, on the basis that they are educational facilities and, seeking legal advice in relation to same.</p>  <p>  My Department has therefore taken a number of steps to pursue this matter, including meeting with relevant officials to explore the possibility of obtaining an exemption of the application of commercial rates to private childcare providers, on the basis that they are educational facilities and, seeking legal advice in relation to same.</p>  <p>  Most recently I contacted the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, requesting reconsideration of the position of private childcare facilities in respect of their rateability for commercial rates.  It was confirmed that there are no proposals under consideration for a discount of commercial rates for private childcare providers, and that the Commissioner of Valuation has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4 of the Act.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have made every effort to raise the concerns of the early learning and care sector in this respect, however as the matter falls outside the remit of my Department, I am constrained in the role I can play.  My Department will, however, continue to monitor this matter. </p></reply>

The actions and tasks agreed will be based on their previous engagements, with particular focus on the identified barriers, which are preventing the person moving into full-time suitable employment.</p><p>To date, some 47,000 jobseekers have commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath as set out in table 1. It should be noted that the figures presented are representative of the entire cohort of JobPath clients between July 2015 and February 2019 and all job starts in the same period. Many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service and will not have had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment nor sustain that employment for up to 52 weeks.

The Act came into force on 4 March 2019.  The 2018 Act introduces a new right for employees whose contract of employment does not reflect the reality of the hours they habitually work.  Such employees will be entitled to request to be placed in a band of hours that better reflects the hours they have worked over a 12 month reference period.  </p><p>The Act provides that an employee may request in writing to be placed in the relevant band of hours.  The employer has four weeks to consider the request.  The Act provides reasonable defences for employers to refuse an employee's request for any one of the following reasons:</p><p>1.  the facts do not support the employee&rsquo;s claim,</p><p>2.  significant adverse changes have impacted on the business (e.g. loss of an important contract), </p><p>3.  emergency circumstances (e.g. business has had to close due to flooding), or </p><p>4.  where the hours worked by the employee were due to a genuinely temporary situation (e.g. cover for another employee on maternity leave).  </p><p>Where the claim is disputed or refused, the employee can refer it to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) for mediation or adjudication.  If the Adjudication Officer finds in the employee's favour the redress will be that they are placed in the appropriate band of hours.  No other form of redress is available.  An appeal against an Adjudication Officer's decision will be to the Labour Court.  </p><p>The Banded Hours provision will not apply to an employer who has entered into a banded hours arrangement through an agreement by collective bargaining with their employees.  This is to recognise that in some sectors, the retail sector in particular, banded hours arrangements have been agreed between the employer and employees and have been working well.  The new provisions will not interfere with these arrangements or with any such agreements that are collectively bargained in the future. </p><p>It is important to remember that an employer is not obliged to offer hours of work in a week where the employee was not expected to work or when the business is not open.</p><p>Current employees will not have to wait 12 months after commencement of this provision to seek to be placed on a band of hours.  From 4 March 2019, an employee who believes their contract does not reflect the hours they have consistently worked over the previous 12 months of service with their employer may request to be placed by that employer in a band of hours that better reflects the hours they have worked regularly.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Both of these schemes allow a person to work up to 3 days a week but they must be fully unemployed for 4 days in 7 consecutive days.  The 2019 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;1.95 billion.</p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit (JB) is a contingency based social welfare payment typically for employees who have suffered a substantial loss of employment and have sufficient social insurance contributions to qualify.  The PRSI contribution classes that count towards qualifying for JB are PRSI Class A, H and P.  Individuals who are self-employed cannot typically access JB as PRSI Class S contributions do not qualify a person for JB.  The contribution conditionality for JB requires a jobseeker to have at least 104 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid since they first started work and 39 weeks qualifying PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year or, 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks qualifying PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year.  The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which the JB claim is made.  So, for claims made in 2019, the relevant tax year is 2017. </p>  <p>  However, a self-employed person who has sufficient social insurance contributions as a PAYE employee could qualify for JB if they are engaged in self- employment for 3 days a week only, if they give up their self-employment or if their self-employment is considered to be subsidiary employment.  To be considered as subsidiary employment the relevant employment should be in addition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s usual employment.  Also, either the amount of earnings or profit from the occupation cannot exceed &euro;144 per week (&euro;7,500 over 12 months), or the jobseeker must have a minimum of 117 PRSI contributions, paid immediately preceding the date of the claim or in respect of the last 3 complete contribution years.  However, the individual must still satisfy all conditions of the JB scheme, including being available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment. </p>  <p>  If the jobseeker does not meet the qualifying contributions for JB they may be eligible for means tested JA or if engaged in farming they may qualify for means tested farm assist. </p>  <p>  The new scheme for the self-employed, which I announced as part of the 2019 Budget measures, will extend a PRSI insurance based benefit to the self-employed who pay class S contributions and who lose employment.  This measure which will be introduced later this year builds on other significant improvements for the self-employed in recent years such as access to invalidity pension and treatment benefits.  This measure is part of the Government&rsquo;s stated aim of creating a supportive environment for entrepreneurship, including providing an income safety net to employees and the self-employed alike. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

One of the most widespread and potentially dangerous consequence of high wind is the risk of trees breaking and/or falling, posing a danger to motorists and pedestrians in the vicinity.

This issue cuts across a number of public bodies and landowners. Under the Roads Act 1993, local authorities have responsibility for trees in public areas while trees on private lands, including lands adjoining public roads, are the legal responsibility of the land owner. </p>  <p>  The inter-departmental recommendations of the review report on severe weather events in 2017/18,  are under active consideration by the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning. </p></reply>

At the end of Quarter 4 2018, there were over 43,000 households having their housing needs met through HAP.  </p><p>HAP is funded through a combination of Exchequer funding and tenant differential rents.  Budget 2019 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;422 million. This will allow for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019, as well as supporting the roll-out of the Homeless HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country. </p><p>Details on the number of tenancy setups and Exchequer funding for HAP from 2014 to 2018 are set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Additional<br /><br />Households supported at end of year</th><th>Outturn<br /><br />&euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>485 </td><td>&euro;0.39m </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>5,680 </td><td>&euro;15.64m </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>12,075 </td><td>&euro;57.69m </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>17,916 </td><td>&euro;152.69m </td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>17,926 </td><td>&euro;276.6m </td></tr></table></p><p>Limerick City and County Council provides a highly effective HAP transactional shared service on behalf of all local authorities.

However, applicants are free to apply to any local authority they choose as long as they meet the eligibility criteria for a loan and my Department is aware that in some instances people have made applications to a number of authorities.

On 1 July 2017, updated regulatory standards, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017, came into effect. These Regulations focus on tenant safety and include new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety.  In August 2017, my Department published guidance to assist and support local authorities in implementing the new Regulations.</p>  <p>  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  Between 2005 and 2017, over &euro;36 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation. Over 224,000 inspections were carried out during this period.</p>  <p>  The Rental Strategy recognises the need for additional resources to be provided to local authorities to aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the Regulations. Provision has been made for &euro;4.5 million of Exchequer funding to be made available to local authorities in 2019 for this purpose, with the intention of providing further increases each year in the period to 2021 to facilitate a targeted inspection coverage of 25% of rental properties annually at that stage. </p>  <p>  Figures in relation to the number of inspections carried out by local authorities in 2018 are currently being collated by my Department and this information will be available on the Department's website by the end of quarter 1 2019.</p></reply>

Dwellings under the scheme come from a number of different sources including private owners, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), Part V and the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle (NARPS).</p><p>Long term lease arrangements, including the enhanced lease, of privately owned dwellings can be entered into by either local authorities or AHBs. Under these arrangements the local authority or AHB acts as the landlord to the tenant. The terms of these agreements are set out in standard template agreements provided by my Department which must be used by all local authorities and AHBs. Agreements may be entered into for periods of between 10 to 25 years in duration; availability agreements under the CALF scheme can be up to 30 years in duration. There are no break clauses provided for in the lease and there are only limited circumstances in which the lease can be terminated by either party. These relate to the performance of the obligations set out in the lease clauses, e.g. a local authority can terminate a lease where the property is uninhabitable due to fire or flood damage; an owner can terminate a lease where the rent is not paid by the local authority.  </p><p>Under the long term leasing arrangement, the dwelling can be sold by the owner during the lease term, subject to the leasehold interest and the consent of the local authority or AHB. As such, the owner of the property changes but the lease, and the tenant, are unaffected. There is no option to purchase the property under the long term lease or enhanced lease arrangements; however, an option to purchase may have been included in some long term leases by local authorities in the early stages of the leasing programme. It is a matter for each local authority if they wish to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, should it become available to buy. </p><p>Local authorities may also enter into availability arrangements with private owners whereby an owner makes their property available to tenants of the local authority for a defined period. Under this type of arrangement, the owner of the property acts as the landlord to the tenant and performs all the landlord obligations. These agreements are for periods of between 1 to 10 years and termination of the agreement is governed by the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended). There is no option to purchase the property in these agreements; however, as with the long term lease, it is a matter for each local authority if they wish to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, should it become available to buy. </p><p>Of the total number of dwellings supported under SHCEP at end 2018, 36% (or 4,210) were owned by a private owner and leased by either an AHB or a LA. The remaining dwellings funded under SHCEP at end 2018 are either owned by AHBs (36% or 4,195 dwellings) or by local authorities and NARPS (28% or 3,279 dwellings). Details of the total number of dwellings funded under SHCEP at end 2018, by ownership, and cost of each category of ownership in 2018 (a breakdown for prior years is not readily available), are set out in Tables 1 and 2. </p><p>Table 1: Total operational dwellings supported under SHCEP 2018<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Private   Ownership </th><th>LA   Ownership</th><th>AHB   Ownership </th><th>NARPS </th><th>TOTAL </th></tr><tr><td>End 2018</td><td>4,210</td><td>2,049</td><td>4,195</td><td>1,230</td><td>11,684</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 2: SHCEP Spend 2018 <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Private Ownership</th><th>LA Ownership</th><th>AHB Ownership</th><th>NARPS</th><th>TOTAL </th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;33,472,522</td><td>&euro;7,112,669</td><td>&euro;46,312,548 </td><td>&euro;12,126,909 </td><td>&euro;99,024,648*</td></tr></table></p><p>* Excludes administrative costs.

Therefore, the existing provisions in the Wildlife Acts on burning remain in force.</p>  <p>  In relation to hedgerows, Section 7(2) of the Heritage Act 2018 provides for the cutting of roadside hedges only during the month of August under Regulations.  Ireland has some 300,000 kilometres of hedgerow mainly surrounding fields and properties across the country and only roadside hedges are subject to the provisions of the Heritage Act - a fraction of the entirety of the total hedgerow resource in this country.  I fully recognise that hedgerows are a very important wildlife habitat, providing food, shelter, corridors of movement, nesting and hibernation sites for many of our native flora and fauna.  The change in timing of cutting set out in Section 7 of the Act should not interfere with any of these functions.   To that end, and to ensure that any birds' nests that might still be active by August will not be at risk, any Regulations made under Section 7(2) will require that any cutting in August may only be of the current year's growth and should not involve the use of heavy flails.  It is the intention that my Department will carry out studies to determine what, if any, effects there are during the pilot phase.   </p>  <p>  I would also point out to the Deputy that both the burning and hedgerow provisions will expire after a two-year pilot period, and it follows that there will be an ongoing assessment throughout the pilot.</p></reply>
