    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-13a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061300045#WRA00600"><p>Jobs differ greatly across the public service and it can be difficult to make direct comparisons between different sectors across the full range of duties. Members of the Defence Forces and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fulfil different roles and have different terms and conditions of service and pay structures. The vast majority of military personnel and Garda&iacute; are engaged in duties on a day-today basis which are quite dissimilar. </p>  <p>  Defence Forces pay and allowances are set, amongst other things, by reference and in consideration of relative levels of pay across a broad range of duties and roles across various sectors of the Irish public sector. </p>  <p>  In addition to basic pay, the Defence Forces have a wide range of allowances which are unique to their duties. A weekly Military Service Allowance is paid to all ranks up to the level of Colonel. Military Service Allowance is designed to compensate for the special disadvantages associated with military life. This includes unsocial hours of duty, exposure to danger, and the restrictions inherent in military discipline. For Privates, Corporals and Sergeants with more 3 years in service, MSA is worth more than &euro;6,023 per annum per person. For Senior NCOs the rate is &euro;6,411 per annum, per person. </p>  <p>  A range of duties attract additional allowances. Certain positions also attract technical pay for enlisted personnel or additional rates for officers. </p>  <p>  Security Duty Allowance is payable to all ranks up to Commandant for certain duties of a security nature performed. This includes duties assisting an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Aid to the Civil Power. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Stability Agreement, 2013-2016, (the Haddington Road Agreement), all sectors across the public service were required to contribute to additional pay and productivity measures. Other sectors delivered these savings through a variety of approaches including additional working time and reduced rates of overtime payments.</p>  <p>  The contribution from the Defence sector included a reduction of 10% on the rate of certain allowances payable to the Defence Forces including Security Duty Allowance. It was also agreed with the Representative Associations that the Saturday and Sunday rates for Security Duty Allowance would be flat rated. </p>  <p>  The Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations have made claims for the restoration of the premium rates, which is being processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration (C&amp;A) Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the C&amp;A scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate to comment further on the matter at this time.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission has conducted a comprehensive examination and analysis of underlying difficulties of recruitment and retention in the Defence Sector. The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform is expected to bring the report prepared by the Commission to Government shortly. The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations in the report. </p></reply>

The associations that have been established are RACO (for commissioned officers) and PDFORRA (for enlisted personnel).</p><p>A Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for members of the Permanent Defence Force provides a formal mechanism for the Defence Forces representative associations to discuss a range of matters relating to the pay and allowances and conditions of service of their members. </p><p>Members of the Permanent Defence Force have accrued significant benefits from the C&amp;amp;A scheme since its introduction both in additional allowances and conditions of employment. In recent months alone, matters concluded through the Defence C&amp;amp;A scheme, have provided for:</p><p>- Additional leave in respect of extended Marriage Leave, Bereavement Leave and Paternity Leave.</p><p>- Certain exemptions from Health Insurance Lifetime Community Rating.</p><p>- Revised arrangements for financial support packages for certain overseas appointments.</p><p>In light of the many changes in the industrial relations landscape since the establishment of the C&amp;amp;A scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force, I initiated a fundamental review of the scheme last year. I appointed Mr. Gerard Barry to conduct the review.  A copy of Mr. Barry's report is available on the Department of Defence website.</p><p>The report of the review contains a number of recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency of the scheme.  All the parties to the Scheme are in the process of developing a revised scheme implementing the recommendations in the &ldquo;Barry&rdquo; report. </p><p>The right to affiliate with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective. In his report, Mr. Barry recommended that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with the ICTU to explore the practicalities of a PDF representative association forming association/affiliation with the ICTU, while giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service.</p><p>This matter is being progressed and dialogue has commenced between the Department of Defence, military management and ICTU. Defence management (civil and military) have met the Representative Associations and will keep them informed of developments.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-13a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061300045#WRA01500"><p>The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) is the regulator for emergency medical services in Ireland and their role is to protect the public. The roles and responsibilities of PHECC include developing Education and Training Standards for awarding qualifications and developing Clinical Practice Guidelines for operational use. </p>  <p>  Organisations who wish to teach using PHECC Education and Training Standards, must apply to PHECC to become a Recognised Institution. Organisations, who wish to be operational, and use the PHECC Clinical Practice Guidelines, must apply separately for an annual licence to operate. </p>  <p>  As the regulator, PHECC do not issue certificates directly. Qualifications recognised by PHECC are awarded through a Recognised Institution. My Department through the Civil Defence College in Roscrea is currently and continues to be a PHECC Recognised Institution, and delivers training and awards qualifications to Civil Defence volunteers. </p>  <p>  The concerns raised recently relate to Civil Defence&rsquo;s annual licence to operate and provide emergency medical services. This licence is required for volunteers who are qualified to Emergency Medical Technician level or above and who are acting for Civil Defence.</p>  <p>  When Civil Defence&rsquo;s current operating licence was up for renewal in November 2018, my officials reviewed the current Statutory Declaration which must be signed by organisations who wish to provide emergency medical services. That review identified that some assurances and details required as part of the licensing process are not within the control or remit of the Department of Defence as responsibility for operations rests with Local Authorities. In contrast, my Department as set out in the 2015 Government White Paper on Defence sets down National Civil Defence policy and provides up to 70% of the cost of delivering Civil Defence services in each Local Authority. </p>  <p>  My officials have been working closely with senior officials in both PHECC and Local Authorities since January of this year in order to find a satisfactory solution to this issue, while conscious of the unique structure of Civil Defence. </p>  <p>  Following recent engagement between officials from my Department and from the County and City Management Association, it has been agreed that Local Authorities will provide some of the assurances required as part of the signing of the Statutory Declaration. In order to allow Local Authorities put in place the necessary processes and collate the required assurances, my officials have applied for a further extension to its existing licence which currently expires on 30 July 2019. </p>  <p>  I can assure you, I am committed to ensuring the excellent service Civil Defence volunteers provide in terms of emergency medical services continues beyond the 30 July 2019.</p></reply>

This will formalise the provision of on-going expert medical advice, including external expert medical advice, to the Defence Forces in relation to a range of medical matters including malaria chemoprophylaxis. </p>  <p>  The Lariam Report Implementation Group has met on a number of occasions and is progressing its work through the formation of a structured plan to implement the recommendations as outlined in the Terms of Reference.  These will include planning, training and education/information sharing as well as the establishment of a Medical Advisory Group.  The Medical Advisory Group has not been established yet.</p>  <p>  Given that there is litigation pending in relation to these matters which is being managed by the State Claims Agency, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further. </p></reply>

This has attracted 2,650 applications to date.</p><p>- The 2019 Cadetship Competition, which closed in May, attracted 2,141 applications.</p><p>- The Aircraft Apprentice Technician competition is expected to launch soon. </p><p>- The Naval Service continues to recruit Direct Entry Officers for Bridge Watch-keeping, Marine Engineering and Electrical Engineering roles.</p><p>- The Defence Forces continue to recruit qualified doctors for careers in the Medical Corps.  </p><p>In addition to the traditional recruitment outlined above, a range of alternative recruitment approaches are being developed, aimed at addressing vacancies in specialist areas. </p><p>- A scheme has been introduced which permits former Officers with specialist skills to re-enter the Permanent Defence Force and arrangements are in train to provide a similar scheme for former enlisted personnel.</p><p>- Currently there is direct entry provision for those with professional qualifications which is utilised for the recruitment of Medical Officers and Engineers.  </p><p>- A working group has been established to examine the scope for greater use of such direct entry recruitment for certain specialist positions.</p><p>Despite recent highly negative media and political commentary, it must be reiterated that the Defence Forces offers an interesting, varied and rewarding career. Starting pay for both enlisted personnel and Officers is competitive when viewed against other career choices with similar entry requirements. There are also a range of allowances paid in addition to basic pay. </p><p>There is also significant ongoing work aimed at making the Defence Forces an attractive career for those currently serving. There are ongoing promotion opportunities. The Defence Forces offers significant opportunities for personnel to develop skills and earn qualifications throughout their career, while receiving full pay.  There are opportunities to gain unique experiences, including on overseas service. There is also ongoing work to enhance work-life balance.</p><p>Clearly the Government&rsquo;s goal is to meet the strength target of 9,500 personnel. There are ongoing challenges in this regard. The independent Public Service Pay Commission have been tasked with examining such recruitment and retention issues and I expect that the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will bring their report to cabinet in the near future. The Government will consider any recommendations made.</p></reply>

It was agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the retirement age for members of the uniformed fast accrual group, which included members of the Permanent Defence Force along with the Garda, Firefighters and Prison Officers, was best dealt with at sectoral level. The detailed policy, operational and manpower issues relevant to these groups could be appropriately considered at that level.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the members of the uniformed fast accrual group, who are currently required to retire early due to the nature of their work, were not covered by the increase in compulsory retirement age from 65 to 70 for Public Servants recruited before 1 April 2004.</p>  <p>  A claim to increase the mandatory retirement age for all Officers was subsequently received from the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO) under the Conciliation and Arbitration (C&amp;A) Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. The Deputy will appreciate that as discussions under the C&amp;A Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the matter at this time.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence (2015) contains a commitment to conduct, in the medium term, a review of HR policies which includes retirement policies, alongside appropriate age profiles for personnel across the Defence Forces. A review of mandatory retirement ages in the Defence Forces will be undertaken in accordance with agreed priorities.</p></reply>

In this regard, a direct entrant competition for the position of military psychiatrist, which closed on 30th September 2018, yielded no applications. To continue to provide an interim in-house service until such time as the military psychiatrist position could be filled, attempts were made to secure a locum psychiatrist but these also proved unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  To explore every option to facilitate an in-house appointment, I gave approval in late 2018 for my Department to conduct a competition for a contracted civilian consultant psychiatrist at pay rates equivalent to those available in the HSE. This approval was subject to sanction by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Sanction has been received, and my Department is currently in the process of making the necessary arrangements for a competition to be advertised.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined on numerous occasions in the past, there is a nationwide shortage of trained psychiatrists, with recruitment issues in a number of sectors of the health service. The difficulty with recruitment for such a position is not unique to the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I also wish to stress yet again that there is no delay in referring Defence Forces personnel requiring immediate psychiatric care or assessment. Patients presenting to Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs) with a requirement for urgent psychiatric assessment are referred to HSE Accident &amp;amp; Emergency Departments. Those requiring hospitalisation are admitted immediately. Furthermore, in order to provide Defence Forces Primary Carers with the broadest range of options possible in dealing with the spectrum of cases that present to them, they have also been authorised to refer cases to local external private psychiatrists for outpatient treatment where deemed appropriate. </p></reply>

This has attracted 2,650 applications to date.</p><p>- The 2019 Cadetship Competition, which closed in May, attracted 2,141 applications.</p><p>- The Aircraft Apprentice Technician competition is expected to launch soon. </p><p>- The Naval Service continues to recruit Direct Entry Officers for Bridge Watch-keeping, Marine Engineering and Electrical Engineering roles.</p><p>- The Defence Forces continue to recruit qualified doctors for careers in the Medical Corps.  </p><p>In addition to the traditional recruitment outlined above, a range of alternative recruitment approaches are being developed, aimed at addressing vacancies in specialist areas. </p><p>- A scheme has been introduced which permits former Officers with specialist skills to re-enter the Permanent Defence Force and arrangements are in train to provide a similar scheme for former enlisted personnel.</p><p>- Currently there is direct entry provision for those with professional qualifications which is utilised for the recruitment of Medical Officers and Engineers.  </p><p>- A working group has been established to examine the scope for greater use of such direct entry recruitment for certain specialist positions.</p><p>While, traditionally, significant inductions take place in the latter part of the year, the military authorities have advised me that, as of 30th April 2019, the following personnel have been inducted into the Permanent Defence Force:</p><p>- 126 General Service Recruits</p><p>- 3 Direct Entry Specialists comprised of 2 Medical Officers and 1 Naval Service Marine Engineer.</p><p>The Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas. And despite recent highly negative media and political commentary, it must be highlighted that the Defence Forces offers an interesting, varied and rewarding career. Starting pay for both enlisted personnel and Officers is competitive when viewed against other career choices with similar entry requirements. There are also a range of allowances paid in addition to basic pay. </p><p>There is also significant ongoing work aimed at making the Defence Forces an attractive career for those currently serving. There are ongoing promotion opportunities. The Defence Forces offers significant opportunities for personnel to develop skills and earn qualifications throughout their career, while receiving full pay.  There are opportunities to gain unique experiences, including on overseas service. There is also ongoing work to enhance work-life balance.</p><p>Clearly the Government&rsquo;s goal is to meet the strength target of 9,500 personnel. There are ongoing challenges in this regard. The independent Public Service Pay Commission have been tasked with examining such recruitment and retention issues. I expect that the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will bring their report to cabinet in the near future. The Government will consider any recommendations made.</p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  The Garda&iacute; requested ATCP assistance from the Defence Forces in support of the recent visit of the President of the United States of America and the number of Defence Forces personnel deployed in response to this request was 497. </p>  <p>  Unlike other areas of the Public Service and due to the nature of the duties performed, overtime is not available to members of the Defence Forces. In addition to basic pay, the Defence Forces have a wide range of allowances which are unique to their duties. A Military Service Allowance (MSA) is paid to all ranks up to the level of Colonel. Military Service Allowance is designed to compensate for the special conditions associated with military life. These include unsocial hours of duty, exposure to danger, and the restrictions inherent in military discipline. For Privates, Corporals and Sergeants with more 3 years in service, MSA is worth &euro;115.43 per week, per person. For Senior NCOs the rate is &euro;122.87 per week. </p>  <p>  In line with any other occasion when the Defence Forces are requested to operate in an Aid to the Civil Power capacity, Defence Force members on duty in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the visit of the President of the United States will receive the Security Duty Allowance (SDA).  The current rate of SDA is &euro;23.81 for each day on duty for less than 24 hours.  The rate is increased to &euro;47.59 for a 24 hour duty.  Security Duty allowance is paid to all enlisted personnel and to officers up to and including the rank of Commandant who are not already in receipt of an Army Ranger Wing Allowance or a Patrol Duty Allowance. </p>  <p>  The assistance provided by the Defence Forces for the duration of the recent visit of the President of the United States of America is greatly appreciated and acknowledged by myself and my colleagues in Government. </p></reply>

The Act provides that a whole time member of the Defence Forces shall be entered in the list. Having regard to the nature of military life, this entitlement ensures the right to vote for members of the Permanent Defence Force. </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence provides a link between the Franchise Section of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the military authorities. This is to ensure that appropriate timelines for postal voting are agreed.</p>  <p>  The Register of Electors is prepared annually by the registration authorities, who prepare the Postal Voters List. The Defence Forces, through the Enlisted Personnel Management Office (EPMO), liaise with the registration authorities to ensure the list is up to date and correct.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces place a very high level of importance on ensuring that all personnel are provided with the opportunity to register for and to receive a postal vote. </p>  <p>  To that end, personnel are provided with access to registration forms, through the chain of command. The commanding officers inform all ranks of the availability of the registration forms. A significant operation then takes place to ensure that those who are registered to vote, at home or overseas, are provided with postal votes, to enable them to exercise their right to vote.  </p>  <p>  Postal votes for Defence Forces personnel were processed and administered by the military authorities in the normal way for the 2019 local and European elections. </p>  <p>  I am informed that a number of personnel have expressed concern that they did not receive a postal vote. These concerns are being examined by the military authorities in the context of a review of the operation of the postal voting system with a view to ensuring that processes and procedures are optimised. The review is expected to conclude shortly.</p>  <p>  I expect the military authorities to take any necessary action on foot of their review to ensure the right of military personnel to exercise their right to vote. </p></reply>

While 592 trained personnel departed during 2018 and 533 trained personnel departed in 2017, the number of trained personnel departing can fluctuate significantly year-on-year.

It is intended that this will formalise the provision of on-going expert medical advice, including external expert medical advice, to the Defence Forces in relation to a range of medical matters including Malaria Chemoprophylaxis.  </p>  <p>  The Lariam Report Implementation Group is progressing its work through the formation of a structured plan using project management techniques to implement the recommendations as outlined in the Terms of Reference.  These include planning, training and education/information sharing as well as the establishment of a Medical Advisory Group. </p>  <p>  As in any project management approach, methods to establish how well the objectives are being met and key-performance indicators (KPIs), are a fundamental requirement.

In this context, it is to be expected that clearer information and communication on the use of Malaria Chemoprophylaxis could potentially lead to a measureable diminution in the number of clarificatory Parliamentary Questions and representations.

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.  </p>  <p>  The fleet of vehicles, armoured and non-armoured utilised in the support of Defence Forces transport and logistics tasks and activities is constantly under review.</p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in 2017, and in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures will provide essential force protection for personnel overseas. </p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2018,  20 minibuses, 22 saloons, 61 logistics vehicles and 2 recovery vehicles were purchased for the Defence Forces,  and funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas. In addition,  a tender competition is underway to replace the Army's 4 x 4 Fitted For Radio fleet of vehicles, while planning is underway to replace the fleet of Troop Carrying Vehicles. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The increases due under the agreement to date have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel.

As such, the RDF undertakes training in preparation to assist the PDF when required. Training across the Defence Forces is constantly measured against best military and academic practice. Training procedures are constantly reviewed in order to ensure that the men and women of the Defence Forces are fully prepared to meet the challenges of the ever changing security environment.</p>  <p>  In the Army Reserve, recruits undergo varied training in areas such as combat first aid, military law and tactical training. A major part of Recruit training is training in the use of the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle. After recruit training is complete, personnel are then trained in the operation of basic radio communications, map reading, Nuclear, Biological &amp;amp; Chemical warfare defence and the Light Machine Gun. Each Corps also carries out specialist training in its particular field. For example, the Infantry and Cavalry Corps train in weapons and tactics and the Corps of Engineers train in engineering tasks, such as demolition, construction and mine warfare.</p>  <p>  In the Naval Service Reserve, the two main courses undertaken as a recruit are Sea Survival and Damage Control &amp;amp; Fire Fighting. Naval Service Reserve personnel also undergo training in the operation of various crafts operated by the Naval Service, such as Motor Training Launches and Rigid Inflatable Boats. As in the Army Reserve, Naval Service Reserve personnel are trained in the use of the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle. Naval Service Reserve personnel also receive full training in VHF Radios, including voice procedure at sea and operation of the VHF systems. Courses are also run for personnel on the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System. </p>  <p>  With regard to RDF training for the current year, Subhead A.5 provides for a budget of &euro;2.15 million of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated for Paid Training Mandays for members of the Reserve. This allocation will provide seven days annual paid training for all effective members of the Reserve, fourteen days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the Reserve in 2019 and provide for career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities. This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the RDF and the voluntary nature of Reserve training. </p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in 2017, and in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures will provide essential force protection overseas. </p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2018, 20 minibuses, 22 saloons, 61 logistics vehicles and 2 recovery vehicles were purchased for the Defence Forces,  and funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas. In addition, a tender competition is under way to replace the Army's 4 x 4 Fitted For Radio fleet of vehicles, while planning is underway to replace the fleet of Troop Carrying Vehicles. </p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with three larger and more capable fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance). It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020. Planning is also in progress to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft and a tender competition is currently underway in this regard. </p>  <p>  The on-going Naval Service ship replacement programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to investment in the Naval Service. Three new Offshore Patrol Vessels were delivered between 2014 and 2017 with a fourth, L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, delivered in late 2018. The mid life extension programme for the P50 class of vessels is currently underway with works on L&Eacute; Rois&iacute;n having commenced in March and the planned programme of works on L&Eacute; Niamh programme will commence in 2020. This structured mid-life extension programme of works will future proof the two vessels, allow for preventative maintenance and address obsolescence of equipment through capitalising on advancements in technology, thus ensuring the reliability of the vessel for the next 15 years. In addition, planning is underway for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel. </p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

I am particularly concerned by the ongoing fighting around the Libyan capital, Tripoli, which is endangering thousands of civilians, including putting already vulnerable migrants and refugees in Libya at further risk. </p><p>At the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2018, the EU committed to continue to work with the Libyan authorities to improve conditions for migrants and refugees, with a view to addressing the current system of detention. The EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, met with the Prime Minister of Libya and the UN Special Representative for Libya in February 2019 and discussed how conditions in detention centres can continue to be improved for migrants with the assistance of the EU and UN agencies.</p><p>Ireland and the EU will continue to support the work of the UN migration and refugee agencies to monitor and improve conditions for refugees and migrants in Libya, including inside detention centres, and to assist with the voluntary return of migrants to their countries of origin. As I have consistently stated, conditions in Libyan detention centres are totally unacceptable. The European Union is working to find ways to ensure that migrants are not held in detention centres in the first place, and to put an end to the system of arbitrary detention in Libya. In the meantime, we are working with the UN migration and refugee agencies and other international partners to provide protection and assistance to vulnerable migrants and refugees at Libyan disembarkation points, in most of the official detention centres, and in host communities.  <b></b></p><p>Unfortunately, the current instability in Libya further limits the capacity of the international community to do this important work in some areas. I applaud the efforts of the UNHCR, which, over the past two months, and in the midst of escalating violence, has successfully relocated hundreds of refugees and migrants from more dangerous areas into safe zones.</p><p>EU diplomats regularly discuss the situation in Libya, taking stock of any opportunities to exert a positive influence on the situation, and to support political efforts to resolve the conflict. In recent EU discussions on Libya, Irish officials have highlighted the importance of guaranteeing the safety of refugees and migrants. However, political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the EU and the wider international community to influence the situation on the ground. Bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants, and ensuring an end to human rights abuses, will require restoration of political stability, and a fully functioning and unified Government. </p><p>Ireland and the EU fully support the work of the UN Special Representative in Libya, Ghassan Salam&eacute;, and we urge all parties to engage constructively with the UN with the aim of achieving a political solution that guarantees Libya&rsquo;s security, economic sustainability, and national unity. At the Foreign Affairs Council in May, we discussed with UN Special Representative Salam&eacute; what the EU can do to help prevent further escalation in the conflict. My officials and I will continue to highlight the plight of migrants and refugees in Libya at every appropriate opportunity.</p></reply>

The proposed Scottish action was based on the UK Government&rsquo;s stance on sovereignty over Rockall and their interpretation of their prerogatives under UK fisheries legislation and the UK&rsquo;s 1972 Island of Rockall Act, combined with the absence of an explicit provision in Annex 1 of the Common Fisheries Policy Regulation permitting Irish vessels to access territorial waters around Rockall.</p>  <p>  Since then, discussions have been ongoing. At political level, the issue was discussed between myself and Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop, in September 2018, and this discussion was followed by an exchange of letters. Further discussions have taken place at senior official level this year. </p>  <p>  On 31 May, Cabinet Secretary Hyslop wrote to me to indicate that, subject to operational priorities, the Scottish Government intended to deploy vessels to the area one week after the date of the letter (i.e. from 7 June) and intended to take enforcement actions against any vessel, regardless of nationality, that it considered to be fishing illegally. I replied to this letter on 5 June, stating the position of the Irish Government and requesting that the Scottish Government reconsider its approach. I spoke with Cabinet Secretary Hyslop on 6 June and, during the course of this conversation, she maintained the Scottish position. </p>  <p>  This is a complex situation. The difference of view between the Irish and Scottish Governments is based on a fundamental question of sovereignty over Rockall, on which Ireland and the UK disagree.</p>  <p>  I should make it clear that as we do not accept that the UK enjoys sovereignty over Rockall, we do not accept that a territorial sea exists around Rockall, nor therefore that the Scottish Government is entitled to exclude Irish vessels from the seas around the rock. We understand that the UK takes a different view, but the approach taken by the Irish and British Governments to the definition of maritime boundaries in the past has been to accept that our views differ and to take no account of Rockall for practical purposes. </p>  <p>  Dialogue regarding Rockall is continuing between the Irish and Scottish Governments. There have been close contacts at official level over recent days. It has now been agreed that a process of intensified engagement will take place, led by senior officials from both administrations.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently said this matter should be dealt with through diplomacy and agreement. We are hopeful that on this basis the latest tensions can be de-escalated.</p></reply>

One of the available phased payment options is Deduction at Source (DAS) from various payment schemes operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).</p>  <p>  These schemes are suitable for DAS as they are paid on a regular (weekly) basis over the course of the year. This allows recipients pay their LPT liabilities in even amounts over a fifty (50) week period, thereby reducing the financial burden to the greatest extent possible. However, section 189 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides that any DAS amounts cannot reduce the personal DEASP rate of payment below &euro;201 per week. Consequently, LPT deductions cannot be applied if they reduce the recipients net payment below this legal &lsquo;de-minimus&rsquo; threshold and Revenue has no discretion to operate outside of this position.</p>  <p>  For situations where DAS is not possible, Revenue provides a number of payment alternatives. For example, property owners can select a single (annual) debit, a monthly direct debit or can make regular payments through one of three approved payment service providers (An Post, Payzone and Omnivend). These options are provided by commercial entities who charge on a per-transaction basis and Revenue has no role in determining the level of cost imposed.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the person in question met her LPT liabilities through DAS from her DEASP payment until February 2015. The arrangement was discontinued after that date because the deduction reduced her net payment below the &lsquo;de-minimus&rsquo; threshold. On confirmation of the situation from DEASP, Revenue made a number of attempts to contact the person to discuss possible alternatives but received no responses. In the absence of any contact, Revenue &lsquo;deferred&rsquo; the person&rsquo;s liability on the basis of her income threshold in accordance with sections 131 and 132 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended).</p>  <p>  Deferral is not an exemption and the unpaid charge remains on the property and accumulates interest at a rate of 4% per year. The deferred amount also attaches to the property as a charge that must be paid before any sale or transfer can take place.</p>  <p>  Revenue is aware that payment of the outstanding amount could cause financial difficulties for the person, assuming she does not wish to continue on the deferral option. For this reason, Revenue has confirmed that it is willing to work with her to agree a mutually satisfactory arrangement. To advance matters, the person should contact Revenue at telephone number 065 6849081.</p></reply>

Pension payments made under the social insurance legislation of Germany are to be taxed only in Germany. Notwithstanding these general rules, pensions are subject to German taxation where pension contributions have been tax-relieved in Germany for a period of 12 years.  However, if Germany does not tax such pensions, then the pension will be taxable in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Government service pensions, i.e. pensions for services rendered to Germany, are taxable only in Germany, unless the services are performed in Ireland by a resident and national of Germany in which case they are taxable only in Ireland.   </p>  <p>  The current German DTC exists since 2011. Where persons are in receipt of pensions before the coming into force of that DTC, there are also options for the pension recipients to continue to avail of certain provisions of the previous DTC.  Under the previous German DTC, pensions (other than Government service pensions) derived from Germany by a person resident in Ireland were to be exempt from tax in Germany, subject to conditions.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a particular case or cases in mind, then, if he could provide further details in relation to particular circumstances of the pension payments, Revenue will endeavour to give a definitive position on the taxation of the pension(s) concerned. </p></reply>

Extensive restrictions are in place and these are not simply confined to a handful of senior bankers whose pay is restricted by the &euro;500,000 pay cap (excluding a standard pension contribution). These affect c.23,000 workers across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding. The policy dictates that variable pay including bonuses and any other fringe benefits including the likes of health insurance and childcare cannot be paid to any staff members from the most junior lowest paid staff to the most senior ranks.</p>  <p>  A new regulatory framework has been put in place since the financial crisis across the EU, the economy has returned to near full employment, the remaining banks are profitable again &ndash; and in the case of AIB and BOI sustainably so. The State remains the largest shareholder in AIB, BOI &amp;amp; PTSB but following the successful IPO of AIB in June 2017 all three banks are also now on an equal footing with listings on the main market of the Irish and London stock exchanges.  </p>  <p>  The skill set required in the banking sector is evolving with the greatest demand for staff now in areas such as the digital economy, risk management, legal and compliance. These skills are in demand right across the economy and so the banks are competing for this talent against companies who have more flexible and attractive remuneration structures. Brexit has only made this problem more acute.</p>  <p>  In the senior ranks of the banks the substantial disparity in pay levels versus other Irish listed companies or peer banks in Europe is stark and introduces an obvious retention risk particularly in AIB and Bank of Ireland. I also need to be advised if this retention risk and a lack of alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders, undermines the Government's objective of recovering the State&rsquo;s full investment in the banks.  </p>  <p>  As a result I undertook last year to carry out a review of Government bank remuneration policy to determine if it remains fit for purpose.  My department held a full open EU public procurement to select a suitably qualified external consultant to assist it in completing this review. The specialist advisory division of International Firm Korn Ferry were subsequently appointed. </p>  <p>  Engagement with a broad set of relevant stakeholders was an important part of the process. Stakeholders engaged with by Korn Ferry and my department included the major institutional investors in the banks, proxy advisory firms, the Financial Services Union (FSU), the chairs of the remuneration committee in each of the banks and representatives of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in Frankfurt. </p>  <p>  I felt it was also important to get the views of the Central Bank on this matter. I note the response from the Governor of the Central Bank in this regard which is available on the Central Bank's website. I expect to receive the report shortly and it is my intention to publish it in due course. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-13a.139.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061300047#WRC02200"><p>At the outset, it is important to note that while as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, my Department does not have a role in the regulation of claims harvesting websites in Ireland nor in the collection of data on the number of these websites.  Allegations of companies engaging in such practices were brought up during the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s consultation process, as well as through representations and Parliamentary Questions submitted to my Department.  </p>  <p>  My Department has considered this issue and consulted with relevant stakeholders such as the Department of Justice and Equality as well as the Law Society of Ireland.  From these consultations, I am informed that claims-harvesting websites can hold themselves out as solicitor firms and purport to provide legal services.  The websites frequently refer to claims for personal injury and, in doing so, attempt to solicit and encourage site visitors into making claims for compensation.  Information received from site visitors with an interest in making such claims is then offered for sale to solicitors on an anonymous panel for the solicitors to contact the claimants directly.  As far as the referral of claims to solicitors within these types of websites may be concerned, it is my understanding that there are already stringent rules in place, most notably under the following legislation:</p>  <p>  - the current Solicitors Advertising Regulations which replaced earlier 2002 regulations and were introduced on 1 June 2019.  These new Regulations retain restrictions specific on the advertising of legal services in respect of personal injury claims.  The prohibitions on non-solicitors advertising services of a legal nature that may induce persons to make claims for damages for personal injuries, together with the prohibitions on unqualified persons from either acting as a solicitor or pretending to be a solicitor, remain unchanged and will continue to be enforced by the Law Society, and</p>  <p>  - section 62 of the Solicitors Act 1954 prohibits solicitors from rewarding or agreeing to reward unqualified persons for the introduction of legal business, i.e., payment of a referral fee.</p>  <p>  The Law Society has informed my Department that, within the terms of its functions under the Solicitors&rsquo; Acts, it actively pursues claims harvesting websites.  From its various consultations, the Department has been advised that the number of active &lsquo;claims harvesting&rsquo; websites operating in Ireland has drastically reduced in recent years from approximately 60 in 2016 to around 11 more recently, although this figure can fluctuate.  The Law Society states that unfortunately, the process of identifying the owners of the websites is often frustrated by the sophisticated ways in which the website owners conceal their identity.  For example, it would appear that many of the websites which are operating in Ireland may not actually be located within the jurisdiction nor within other EU countries.  I understand that this factor increases the levels of complexity of investigations, as it can be particularly difficult to establish who the owners of the relevant websites are.  Notwithstanding these challenges, my Department has been informed by the Law Society that 23 websites that have been removed from the internet since 2014 and since last year, a further three websites have been removed from the internet, with another two websites identified as belonging to a company that has gone into liquidation.  </p>  <p>  With the application of section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, solicitor advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present.  Instead, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will maintain the restrictions of any advertisement which, in the opinion of the Authority, &ldquo;expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages or offers any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for personal injuries or seek legal services in connection with such claims.&rdquo;  The Authority will be undertaking consultations for the making of regulations for the advertising of legal services by legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, under section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  It is my understanding that the new advertising regulations are planned to come into operation in Quarter 1 of 2020.</p>  <p>  In light of the above, it is clear that the regulation of claims harvesting websites is a complex matter but that the existing solicitor regulations have helped prevent such websites to evolve to become a more prevalent feature of the Irish personal injuries environment, in the way that they are in the UK, for example.  I am satisfied that the relevant professional bodies are pursuing such websites to the extent that they can in light of the challenges that exist.  Notwithstanding this, my officials will continue to monitor the prevalence or otherwise of this issue.  In addition, I would suggest that if anyone is of the view that particular solicitor firms are using such claim harvesting websites, they should report the matter to the Law Society/ Legal Services Regulatory Authority for investigation. </p></reply>

As per the 2019 Stability Programme Update, the overall level of general government expenditure this year is projected to be &euro;85.345 million up from &euro;81.985 million in 2018. My officials are preparing the Summer Economic Statement 2019 which forms the next stage of the budgetary process. This will include a medium-term economic strategy and narrative and also provides an updated assessment of the fiscal policy parameters.</p>  <p>  In June, the Commission published its assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s 2019 Stability Programme Update (SPU). On an ex-post basis, Ireland did not achieve its Medium-Term Objective (MTO) in 2018 with an estimated structural deficit of 1.4 per cent of GDP.  However, there are important caveats to this. First, the Commission have acknowledged the very open nature of the economy and the difficulty in estimating the output gap (needed to assess the structural budget position). Partly for this reason, they prefer to use the expenditure benchmark as a guide to fiscal policy.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the rate of increase in spending exceeded the limit applicable under the expenditure benchmark. However, the mechanical assessment of the expenditure benchmark takes no account of the non-indexation of income taxation in Ireland (which would permit higher levels of spending, all other things being equal). This is accounted for in an overall assessment and thus the breach of the expenditure benchmark was not adjudged to be significant by the Commission. In simple terms, the Commission&rsquo;s overall assessment is one of broad compliance in 2018. </p>  <p>  For 2019, the forecasts underlying the Stability Programme are compliant with the expenditure benchmark limit. When the years 2018 and 2019 are taken together, the Commission also adjudges Ireland to be compliant with the expenditure rule. The Commission acknowledges some risks of non-compliance with the fiscal rules but concludes that the overall assessment is one of compliance. As regards the MTO (-0.5 per cent structural deficit), the Commission&rsquo;s assessment is that Ireland will be compliant in both 2019 and 2020.</p></reply>

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  </p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a claim. </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department will seek to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings had been determined on completion of a survey.  My Department is fully open to having further dialogue with Forsa once this work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or particular age groups or on the basis of some other criterion. For example, some schools give priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school (known as a feeder school).  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, was signed into law by the President on the 18th July 2018. The overall objective of the Act is to provide a new framework for school enrolment that is designed to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications for admission is structured, fair and transparent.</p>  <p>  New schools established to cater for demographic demand are required to prioritise enrolment of children in the school planning area(s) for which the Department has identified the need for a school.</p></reply>

The Teaching Council advise that, for teachers qualified outside of Ireland, the assessment and registration process may typically take up to 12 weeks from receipt of all application documentation and depending on the time of year, recommending that applicants apply in advance of their planned return to or commencement of teaching in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).  </p>  <p>  Department Circular 31/2011 sets out to ensure, as far as possible, that people appointed to teach are registered teachers with qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are employed and that unemployed teachers are offered employment in preference to those who have retired.  These measures were taken in an effort to increase employment opportunities for unemployed teachers. </p>  <p>  An unregistered person who is not appropriately qualified and registered for the sector is paid at the unqualified rate of pay and can only be paid the qualified rate of pay for teachers from the date they are appropriately registered with the Teaching Council.</p></reply>

The Council is examining whether there are any students for whom both specialist and mainstream educational settings are currently not working and consider what might be contributing to this. </p>  <p>  We have significantly increased the availability of special placements for children with special educational needs as well as bringing more and more children into mainstream education.</p>  <p>  The number of ASD special classes has more than doubled in the last 5 years from 511 in 2014 to 1,196 across the country now. Provision in special schools has increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year. The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish approx. 156 new ASD special classes nationally for 2019/20 school year to meet currently identified need.</p>  <p>  Where students are excluded from school, the Department provides home tuition as a short term measure until a more permanent solution is identified.</p>  <p>  Circulars 0013 and 0014/2017, which introduced the model for allocating special education teachers to schools, noted the importance of educational planning. This is in the context of ensuring that the children with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.</p>  <p>  The NCSE Regional Support Service, which has incorporated the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behavioural Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for the Visually Impaired and Hearing Impaired, provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers and continuing professional development for teachers. </p>  <p>  It is also enhancing the multi-disciplinary capacity of the education system through providing access to expert knowledge in areas such as autism, speech and language and challenging behaviour. </p>  <p>  Schools are required to have policies in place for the promotion of student wellbeing, positive behaviour and an environment that is conducive to good teaching and learning.  Advice and support is available to help schools in this regard.</p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) supports children with ASD, including those who may also present with Anxiety. This involves working with the teachers to build whole school capacity on working with children with special educational needs including autism and anxiety.  It also involves working with individual children who are experiencing difficulty. </p>  <p>  There are legal provisions around the exclusion and expulsion of students and these are the responsibility of TUSLA. Fair procedures are a key requirement. Expulsion should be a last resort and reduced timetables should not be used as a behavioural management technique.  </p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport under the terms of the Special Educational Needs Scheme may be accommodated on existing services, be offered a Special Transport Grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements or have a new service established to provide them with transport from their home to school. Children who are not eligible for school transport under the terms of this scheme may also apply for transport on a concessionary basis where suitable services are available.</p>  <p>  The NCSE and my Department work closely together to address issues in specialised provision that arise from time in time at local levels and also to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.  </p>  <p>  While the NCSE and my Department continue to encourage stakeholders to open special classes, the process under the admissions legislation will continue and may lead to interaction with education providers entering a more formal process. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for ensuring all children have access to a suitable education is a shared responsibility.  I am confident that through the work of NCSE and the cooperation of schools we can address current difficulties.</p></reply>

The Act also removes those who offer their services as a prostitute from the existing offences of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution. One purpose of these measures is to provide additional protection to persons involved in prostitution, especially vulnerable persons and victims of human trafficking. This measure allows persons working in prostitution to provide information to the Garda&iacute; on, for example, violence towards them by clients, without risking prosecution for selling sexual services.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 does not introduce a new offence of brothel-keeping. This offence has its basis in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993. The 2017 Act increased the penalty for brothel-keeping on summary conviction to a class A fine (&euro;5,000) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. Prior to amendment these penalties were &euro;1,000 and 6 months, respectively. The penalty for conviction on indictment remained unchanged: a fine not exceeding &pound;10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.</p>  <p>  These measures and others introduced by Part 4 of the 2017 Act are part of the Government efforts to target the demand for prostitution and are reinforced through awareness-raising efforts and well-publicised Garda operations. As regards decriminalising the offence of brothel-keeping, there are concerns that this could create a loophole that could be open to abuse by criminal gangs and others who wish to profit from prostitution.</p>  <p>  In relation to a review of the 2017 Act, Part 4 of the Act specifies that, not later than 3 years after its commencement, a Report will be prepared on the number of arrests and convictions in respect of the new offences, as well as an assessment of the impact on those who provide sexual services for payment. </p>  <p>  Once the mechanism for the review has been finalised, the Department expects that concerns such as those raised by the Deputy will be considered, along with other submissions made.</p></reply>

It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and is, as I am sure you will agree, a very important task which must be done thoroughly and correctly. My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.</p>  <p>  Regarding sharing of vetting between organisations, vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. </p>  <p>  However, the Act provides for the sharing of vetting disclosures in certain circumstances by registered organisations; a facility which is of assistance in the health and education sectors, for example, in reducing the need for multiple vetting applications. Section 12(3A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of a person to undertake relevant work or activities, thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p>  <p>  In general, the vetting process is working well and I understand that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda vetting at present. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-vetting system is 5 working days for over 85% of applications received. Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the e-vetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online. Furthermore, in circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.</p></reply>

The application of a Plan ensures a safe working environment for staff and a safe environment for prisoners. </p>  <p>  The Plan is heavily focussed on ensuring the continued delivery of structured activities to prisoners and on encouraging prisoners to engage in structured activities by prioritising the assignment of staff to these services, while continuing to prioritise security, safe custody and the safety of staff.    </p>  <p>  There are clear advantages to the implementation of a Regime Management Plan to address staff shortages and prioritise the tasks that can be delivered at prison level. It should be noted that the objective of a Plan is to direct resources at prisoners who wish to engage in constructive activities and to afford other prisoners the opportunity to avail of out of cell time for exercise and recreation. All prisons have introduced a Regime Management Plan in recent years.  </p>  <p>  The Regime Management Plan implemented in the Midlands Prison is  prioritising constructive out of cell time which includes work and training, education, physical and mental health, engagement with therapeutic services, ahead of non-constructive activities which include access to exercise yards.  Exercise yards and recreation areas are prioritised in the evenings and at weekends. All prisoners who wish to engage with structured activities are being interviewed with a view to creating a timetable for each which maximises attendance at structured activity and minimise time spent in cell.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I have been informed by the IPS that less  than 6% of posts in the Midlands are currently vacant. This small shortfall in resources is being addressed with the ongoing recruitment of RPOs and Midlands together with other prisons in the estate are assigned Officers as they complete training. </p></reply>

These are the very substantial challenges that remain to finding a cost-effective regulatory response at either national or international level to claims harvesting operations, including as considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.</p>  <p>  As far as those aspects of claims harvesting which fall within the remit of my own Department may be concerned, the key regulatory focus continues to be on the interface between claims harvesters and those solicitors with whom they would wish to engage in a mercenary manner to the detriment of our insurance regime. This is being applied diligently by the Law Society which continues to take a strict approach against any offending solicitors or claims harvesters in this area as appropriate to the Society's role as the regulator of solicitors under the Solicitors' Acts. </p>  <p>  This approach, which has proven highly effective, has a number of key legislative components. Section 5 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002 generally prohibits unqualified persons from advertising a service of a legal nature that could otherwise be provided by a solicitor for a fee or reward.  This includes such advertising in relation to personal injuries claims in the context of claims harvesting websites. Moreover, section 62 of the Solicitors Act 1954 prohibits solicitors from rewarding or agreeing to reward unqualified persons for the introduction of legal business and provides that any such agreement is void. Under the Solicitors Advertising Regulations as recently updated by the Law Society with my consent under S.I. No. 229 of 2019, it remains the case that an advertisement intended to publicise or otherwise promote a solicitor in relation to the solicitor's practice shall be in such a form as shall not expressly or impliedly solicit, encourage or offer any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for damages for personal injuries or to contact the solicitor concerned with a view to such claims being made. </p>  <p>  From the active engagement by the Law Society and the on-going work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, I understand that the number of active claims harvesting websites operating in Ireland has drastically reduced in recent years from approximately 60 in 2016 to around 11 in more recent times. It is also understood from the Law Society that 23 websites have been removed from the internet on foot of its efforts since 2014 with further such removals possible.  The Society has previously issued relevant practice directions and directly notified claims referral companies found to be targeting solicitors about the statutory prohibition on solicitors paying referral fees. It has also successfully pursued these matters before the High Court and is, therefore, to be commended for the diligent and effective discharge of its particular regulatory functions in response to this threat to our insurance regime.</p>  <p>  This strict approach is set to continue under the new advertising provisions of section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. Under that section, such advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present but by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. Specifically, section 218(d)(vi) of the 2015 Act allows for the restriction of any advertisement which, in the opinion of the Authority, &ldquo;expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages or offers any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for personal injuries or seek legal services in connection with such claims.&rdquo; The Authority will be carrying out the required public consultations in preparation for the new legal services advertising regulations coming into operation in Q1 of 2020. </p>  <p>  In so far, therefore, as claims harvesting operations are seeking to directly or indirectly engage solicitors in their claims work, the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2015 are operating as a bulwark against them with recognised effect. Such a regulatory approach will continue under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. While, in broader terms, the issue of claims harvesting does not seem at this time to lend itself to an immediately amenable regulatory solution, I will, along with my Department, continue to support the on-going work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and of the Law Society in this regard.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Cohort Model of resource allocation is currently utilised for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College. Using this model, the allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, and operational strategies. When considering the allocation of resources to a Division, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all factors are taken into consideration.</p><p>In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it is important to keep in mind that they have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that while not all Garda Stations are training stations, the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p><p>The information in relation to the number of new recruits allocated by Division on 7th June 2019 is as set out in the table, as supplied by the Commissioner.</p><p>I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that the level of recruitment of Garda members planned for 2019 will ensure that the Government's commitment to increasing the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000 Garda members by 2021 will be achieved.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This has seen an increase in the number of Garda members to just over 14,000 at the end of 2018, a net increase of over 1,000 since the end of 2016. </p><p>The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, including provision for the recruitment of new Garda&iacute; and Garda Staff this year. The Garda Commissioner has informed me that he intends to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and a net 600 Garda Staff. This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. This is in addition to the approximately 260 Garda&iacute; redeployed from administrative to front line duties by the end of 2018.</p><p>The Garda strength by Division from 2009 to 30 April 2019 , as provided by the Commissioner, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link.http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/003_Garda_Numbers_by_Division_2006_to_April_%202019.xlsx/Files/003_Garda_Numbers_by_Division_2006_to_April_%202019.xlsx</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link:</p><p>Divisional Allocations - as at 7th June 2019<table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>TRAINING STATION</th><th>Training station breakdown</th><th>Divisional Total allocation  at 7/6/2019</th></tr><tr><td>DMR East</td><td>Blackrock</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dun Laoghaire</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dundrum</td><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>DMR North </td><td>Ballymun</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Balbriggan </td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clontarf</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Coolock</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Raheny</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Swords</td><td>4</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>DMR Nth Central</td><td>Bridewell</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mountjoy</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Store St <font color="#FF0000">  </font></td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>DMR South</td><td>Rathfarnham</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Rathmines</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sundrive Rd</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tallaght</td><td>14</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Terenure </td><td>2</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>DMR Sth Central </td><td>Irishtown</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kevin St</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilmainham</td><td>6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Pearse St</td><td>13</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Donnybrook</td><td>3</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>DMR West </td><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Blanchardstown </td><td>7</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clondalkin</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Finglas</td><td>7</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Lucan </td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ronanstown</td><td>2</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>Ashbourne</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Navan</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Trim</td><td>2</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>Waterford</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>Galway</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>Cavan</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Monaghan</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Carrickmacross</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Bailieboro</td><td>3</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>Drogheda</td><td>25</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dundalk </td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ardee</td><td>2</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>Letterkenny</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Buncrana</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ballyshannon</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Milford</td><td>2</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td>201</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It will further underpin close cooperation in the European Competition Network.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), ComReg, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Irish Courts are National Competition Authorities (NCAs) in Ireland for the purposes of EU competition law.</p><p>The ECN+ Directive ensures that NCAs:</p><p>1. have effective investigation and decision-making tools </p><p>2. are able to impose effective deterrent fines</p><p>3. have a leniency programme in place which facilitates application for leniency in multiple jurisdictions, and </p><p>4. have sufficient resources and can enforce the EU competition rules independently.</p><p>It is intended to transpose the ECN+ Directive by primary legislation and it is intended that the Directive will be transposed into national law by the deadline of 4 February 2021. </p><p>My Department undertook a public consultation on the proposed Directive in May 2017. Six replies were received to that consultation, including replies from the CCPC and ComReg. My Department is also in consultation with the CCPC and ComReg on how best to confer the powers given by the Directive to NCAs. In addition, my Department will be working closely with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on the transposition of the Directive, including matters such as the introduction of non-criminal sanctions and the leniency programme, which are not currently provided for in Irish competition law.</p></reply>

Once the European Commission opens an investigation into a matter it relieves the competition authorities of the Member States of their competence to apply EU competition rules to the alleged practices concerned.</p>  <p>  The CCPC has also been, and will continue to, co-ordinate with and provide support to the European Commission in their investigation. Within this context, in July 2017, the CCPC assisted the European Commission in unannounced inspections at premises of companies active in motor insurance in the Republic of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the Commission is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of alleged anti-competitive practices. </p>  <p>  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Commission, I, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, have no direct function in the matter.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the CCPC&rsquo;s resources, the CCPC has 100 staff members (from an initial figure of 82 in 2014 when the CCPC was formally established), 29 of whom work in the enforcement of competition law, including investigators, economists and lawyers (from 21 in 2014). It should be noted that some of these staff work on other enforcement areas e.g. car crime and pyramid selling.  </p>  <p>  In 2018 the CCPC filled 23 vacancies across the organisation, this included for new specialised roles, including a digital forensics unit. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the CCPC is active across a number of different sectors, with active investigations in the ticketing, insurance, procurement of school transport services and the bagged cement sectors. By their nature competition law and other white-collar crime investigations take considerable time as they are often based on obtaining evidential paper trails. In order for them to be legally robust, all the necessary investigative and procedural steps must be taken. The CCPC has secured a number of important outcomes in various sectors &ndash; including securing the first conviction for bid-rigging in Ireland and securing commitments from various bodies to address competition concerns.</p></reply>

However, to-date the LEO has not received the completed &quot;Expression of Interest&quot; form.  The LEO business advisor discussed with the individual the different financial assistance available to microenterprises along with the various soft supports in the form of training for anyone interested in starting or growing their business (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course). </p><p>In general, the LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into viable export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories, namely feasibility grants, priming grants and business development grants for existing businesses that want to expand. In addition, there is a technical assistance grant available for eligible micro-exporter applicants which are seeking to explore alternative markets for their product or service.</p><p>The Advisor also discussed the different incentives and schemes available including: </p><p>- Microfinance Loan Scheme</p><p>- Trading Online Voucher Scheme</p><p>- Revenue incentives</p><p>- New Frontiers Programme</p><p>- Current co-working and hub spaces available.</p><p>In conclusion, I would urge the individual to engage further with the relevant LEO for more information with a view to pursuing the feasibility study grant application. In that regard, I am assured that the LEO  will do all it can to assist in this application in order to determine whether and which financial assistance it can provide.</p></reply>

The campaign communicates the risks and dangers of cocaine use to dependent users and at-risk groups, as well as to those who engage in &lsquo;recreational use&rsquo;. It is important to increase awareness of the risks associated with drugs like crack cocaine and highlight how these risks are hugely increased when combined with alcohol.</p>  <p>  Recently, the HSE, in partnership with the Union of Students in Ireland, launched a new harm-reduction information campaign, called #SaferStudentNights.

To achieve this the HSE must ensure that the total number of hours being provided does not exceed targeted levels.

My Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period. The cost of applying the change to existing residents who will qualify from the coming into effect of the provisions has been factored into the overall cost of this proposed legislative change.</p>  <p>  The Heads of Bill has been circulated to Government this week. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. I intend to progress as quickly as possible, however, the timeline for completion of the legislation will also depend on how it passes through the Houses.</p>  <p>  The full year cost of this change to the Scheme is estimated at &euro;9.7m per annum, this however will likely increase after 3 years of the changes being in operation. It is estimated that the cost will increase to &euro;11.6m per annum after this point.</p></reply>

This will require farmers to achieve a higher level of environmental ambition through both mandatory and incentive-based measures.</p>  <p>  The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has made and will continue to make an increasingly significant contribution to the environmental sustainability of the Irish agriculture.  The report shows Ireland as having the second highest &ldquo;climate relevant&rdquo; spending under CAP, when compared to other Member States, demonstrating our commitment and determination to meet the challenge of climate change. Despite uncertainties over the level of future CAP budgets, compounded by on-going Brexit negotiations, the Irish government remains committed to sustaining a strong environmental focus and further mainstreaming climate action under any future CAP programme.</p>  <p>  While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and energy targets in the years ahead. Towards this end, one of the positives that can be taken from this report is the high level of Knowledge Transfer actions which Ireland supports under the current CAP programme when compared to other Member States. These Knowledge Transfer actions along with a strong Farm Advisory Service (also supported under CAP) will allow Irish agriculture to quickly respond to the future expected consequences of climate change.</p>  <p>  Mitigation of emissions from the agriculture sector will depend on encouraging behavioural change. Appropriate measures under a new CAP will provide a key vehicle for incentivising such change. Any national CAP Plan will be informed to a significant extent by the need to encourage farmers to engage in climate change mitigation activities.</p></reply>

The United Kingdom claims sovereignty over Rockall and thus a twelve mile territorial sea around it.  The United Kingdom first made its claim of sovereignty to Rockall in 1955 and sought to incorporate it as part of the UK in its domestic law by virtue of the Island of Rockall Act 1972. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government has never sought to claim sovereignty over Rockall.  Our position has been and remains that it does not accept the UK&rsquo;s claim to sovereignty over Rockall, which it regards as forming part of the UK&rsquo;s exclusive economic zone and, accordingly, part of European Union waters under the Common Fisheries Policy, to which the principle of equal access for the vessels of all EU Member States applies.  Irish vessels have operated unhindered in the Rockall zone for many decades fishing haddock, squid and other species and these fisheries are of substantial economic importance to our fishing fleet based in Greencastle, Killybegs, Castletownbere and other ports around the country.</p>  <p>  I met with the Irish fishing sector on Friday last to inform them of the letter from the Scottish Authorities. I also emphasised that Ireland&rsquo;s position in relation to Rockall had not changed.  The industry was appreciative of that engagement but was also extremely concerned at the possibility that unjustified enforcement action might be taken against them.</p>  <p>  We have built with Scotland a strong and positive relationship, to our mutual benefit, over many years.  I hope that we can use that close relationship to find a way to resolve these matters and to remove the threat of enforcement action against Irish vessels.  Dialogue is continuing between the Irish and Scottish Governments and there have been close contacts at official level over recent days.  It has now been agreed that a process of intensified engagement will take place, led by senior officials from both administrations.  We are hopeful that, on this basis, the latest difficulties can be de-escalated.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agri-food and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year for farm incomes in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission. The announcement by the Commissioner is another example of the importance of EU solidarity when it comes to facing significant economic challenges.</p>  <p>  This exceptional aid provision will be given effect through a Commission Implementing Regulation. While Member States will be invited to give an opinion on the draft Regulation through the Commission&rsquo;s Common Market Organisation Management Committee, the draft Regulation is within the Commission&rsquo;s own legal competence, and is not for negotiation with Ireland or indeed other Member States, in terms of its content.</p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p></reply>

To supplement this measure, the NTA administers a WAV Grant Scheme, which offers grants on a sliding scale from &euro;2,500 to &euro;7,500. The scheme aims to assist with the cost difference in purchasing a WAV or converting a vehicle to fulfill the WAV requirements. This scheme is open to all SPSV drivers, with grants offered on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>  <p>  The NTA, as the Regulator, set the standards for entry to the SPSV sector with a view to protecting the public interest and ensuring public safety and consumer protection. All prospective drivers and dispatch operators applying to enter the industry are subject to the same rules and conditions thus ensuring a level playing field. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to increasing the number of WAVs within our SPSV fleet and supporting the NTA in the administration of the WAV Grant Scheme.</p></reply>

Athlete welfare is paramount. Various organisations have concussion and head injury guidelines for their sports, which stress the importance of ensuring the health and well-being of the athletes.   </p>  <p>  However, as neither I nor Sport Ireland have a statutory role or remit with regard to monitoring, reviewing, or ensuring consistency between, the safety standards in use by, or applicable to, National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs), the question of introducing a standardised concussion policy for all sports does not arise. Responsibility for athlete safety and participants rests with the individual National Governing Bodies of Sport. The approaches taken in each sport in relation to concussion are accordingly a matter for the NGBs themselves with cognisance being taken of the risk profile of the particular sport concerned, that sport&rsquo;s collective experience and the medical expertise within the relevant sport. </p>  <p>  NGBs must, of course, abide by Health and Safety legislation and should have regard to any guidance issued by relevant statutory agencies. The safety of all those involved in sport is of paramount importance, whether as participants, competitors, spectators, volunteers or workers.</p></reply>

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.   The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Board is independent in the performance of its functions, and as Minister, I have no role in the operational matters pertaining to the implementation of the scheme. The Board may be contacted by phone at Lo call 1890 252842 or by email to info@pyriteboard.ie or alternatively at oireachtasinfo@pyriteboard.ie. </p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that a total of 2,393 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme. Of these, 1,939 dwellings have been included in the scheme, with the applicants notified accordingly, and 1,579 dwellings have been remediated.  </p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;32 million is available to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year.  This will facilitate the remediation of some 460 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings. This will bring to approximately &euro;126m the total funding provided under the scheme since 2014.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the Pyrite Remediation Board, together with the Housing Agency, will arrange for all eligible dwellings to be remediated to a high standard and at no additional cost to the affected homeowners. Remediation works will continue to be carried out at the earliest possible opportunity having regard to the existing demands of the scheme and the optimum use of available resources. There is no closing date for applications.</p></reply>

These are currently being assessed by my Department and I intend to issue approvals under this second call in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  There are currently 3 LIHAF projects in Fingal County Council and it is projected that they will, cumulatively deliver 40 affordable units and 2,070 cost reduced units.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, the most recent figures available to my Department indicate that up to the end of May 2019, 580 loan applications received by Fingal County Council had been assessed by the Housing Agency central assessment service, 339 of which had been recommended for approval.  In terms of loans issued,  the latest information available, as at end Q1 2019, indicates that Fingal County Council has issued a total of 99 Rebuilding Ireland loans, with a value of &euro;21.7m. </p></reply>

The work of the Task Force has now been completed and its findings are reflected in &ldquo;Fire Safety in Ireland: Report of the Fire Safety Task Force&rdquo;, which was published and is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/fire_safety_in_ireland_-_report_of_the_fire_safety_task_force.pdf.</p><p>The Directorate's Management Board has been tasked with implementation of the recommendations within its remit, and oversight of the implementation of other recommendations.  Work to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations is under way, including proposals for new regulatory provisions for management of fire safety in buildings to which section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts applies.</p><p>Following the tragic loss of life in Carrickmines, County Dublin on 10 October 2015, my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) was tasked with developing and overseeing a Programme to review and enhance Fire Safety in Local Authority provided Traveller accommodation. This was undertaken in association with and supported by Travellers&rsquo; representative groups. As part of the review process, a working draft of a &ldquo;Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation&rdquo; was developed, including  fire safety advice, guidance and standards applicable in various types of Traveller accommodation.</p><p>Fire safety in domestic settings is a shared responsibility, and the guide emphasises an approach to life safety through the prevention of fires, fire safety awareness and early detection and warning of fire through working smoke alarms. My Department published the &quot;&quot; on 21 September 2016, which is available at the following link: </p><p>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/report_on_review_of_fire_safety_in_local_authority_provided_traveller_accommodation.pdf.</p><p>In July 2015, a review was undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application, in the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise. </p><p>This review was completed and the 'Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in dwellings where concerns arise', was published on 25 August 2017. The framework which is available on my Department's website at: </p><p>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/framework_for_enhancing_fire_safety_in_dwellings.pdf contains the following:</p><p>-  an explanation of the statutory provisions in respect of fire safety, namely the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 and the Fire Services Acts 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, and the respective responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, occupants, local authorities;</p><p>-  a range of actions that may reduce risk and improve the level of fire safety where deficiencies arise in dwelling houses, apartments and/or the common areas of apartment buildings; and </p><p>-  a fire risk assessment methodology for professional advisors to prioritise the remedial actions, if any, that may need to be carried out on a dwelling.</p><p>The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. In addition to owners and occupants, the Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable the continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. </p><p>From a regulatory perspective, Part B (Fire Safety) of the second schedule to the Building Regulations is under review.  In this context, a new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017. This Volume 2 applies to dwelling houses only. Important revisions in the TGD B Volume 2 include enhanced provision for fire detection and alarm systems in dwelling houses, guidance on fire safety in community dwelling houses, guidance on timber frame construction, including new provisions in respect of timber frame party walls, enhanced provisions in respect of loft conversions, new provisions for galleries in dwelling houses and other general updates. A revised Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwelling houses (including apartment buildings), is being prepared for public consultation at present.  </p><p>Finally, in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade my Department has advanced a robust and focused Building Control Reform Agenda, including:</p><p>-  Amendments to the Building Control Regulations;</p><p>-  Establishment of a shared services National Building Control Management Project; and</p><p>-  The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill.</p><p>These reforms have already brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations. </p></reply>

In addition, a specific affordability dividend is being secured on most projects, either through local affordable housing schemes administered by the local authorities under the LIHAF Programme, or LIHAF cost reduced units. 2,300 affordable homes will be delivered on mainly publicly owned lands supported through LIHAF, subject to planning permission, along with an additional 5,686 homes which will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction, some of which are already coming to market.  </p><p>Details on all of the LIHAF projects by local authority area, budget allocation, project timeframe and description, and housing delivery have been published on the Rebuilding Ireland website and are available at the following link: www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF.</p><p>In terms of LIHAF funding drawdown, thus far, most projects have been at the design and planning stages, with the bulk of expenditure arising during the construction phase, and this is reflected in the level of expenditure to date.  As more projects progress further through construction/completion of infrastructure works it is expected that the drawdown will increase significantly during the rest of 2019 and 2020.  </p><p>The following tables give details of LIHAF drawndown to end Q1 2019 and delivery of projects including affordable units and cost reduced units which are part of the affordable measures being delivered through LIHAF.  Further drawdown of funds is envisaged in the coming weeks once Q2 2019 claims are submitted by local authorities.<table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>Project Name</th><th>Residential Units

As part of this, the future housing needs of our growing population are of course among the key issues that will be addressed through the NPF.  </p>  <p>  The NDP established four new funds, with a combined allocation of &euro;4 billion to 2027.  The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), which is the fund operated by my Department, was launched last year and has an overall provision of &euro;2 billion to 2027.  &euro;58m is available in 2019 to provide initial support to the 88 projects announced last November on foot of the first call for proposals.  &euro;550 million is included in the NDP to provide further support for these and other similar projects up to 2022. </p>  <p>  The URDF was established to support applicant led projects that will contribute to regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the NPF and the NDP. The aim is to achieve more compact,  sustainable and mixed use development, with a view to ensuring that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit. This will be done by supporting proposals that contribute to the re-development of key brownfield areas both by enabling infrastructure and new master-planned development proposals. </p>  <p>  While the URDF is not intended to provide direct support for particular housing projects, some of the projects it is currently supporting will enable a significant proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns.</p>  <p>  The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund  falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development. </p></reply>

My Department and local authorities administer a number of funding programmes to assist AHBs with the cost of building, buying and leasing new social houses. All funding is conditional on the properties being made available to households on local authority waiting lists.</p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), my Department, together with local authorities, can support AHBs to construct, purchase or lease housing units and make them available for social housing. The housing units are secured under long-term leases/availability arrangements between local authorities and AHBs, the cost of which is recouped to local authorities by my Department. The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units, including units acquired through the establishment of the Housing Agency Acquisition Fund.</p><p>The capital advance, which is up to 30% of the value of the eligible capital costs, is repayable by the AHB to the local authority at the end of a Payment and Availability (P&amp;amp;A) agreement, usually 30 years. All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review, to ensure that each project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available.</p><p>To date, 26 AHBs have availed of CALF to secure homes for social housing use. Funding eligibility is aligned to those AHBs signed up to and demonstrating compliance with the Voluntary Regulation Code. </p><p>AHBs and local authorities work closely on a local basis to plan and programme new social housing supply. This collaborative approach ensures that there is local authority support for a project prior to submission to my Department for funding approval. Applications for funding for a scheme or individual homes, which have not progressed, may have been withdrawn by local authorities or AHBs for various reasons, including the opportunities no longer being available. In many cases, the applications are resubmitted with revisions or by another AHB.</p><p>The CALF was introduced in 2011 and only a small number of AHBs availed of the facility during the period 2011 to 2013, delivering a total of 498 additional social housing homes under the scheme. Only over the last number of years has the sector moved to accessing private funding/ borrowing and moving away from full exchequer support. Since 2014, the number of homes delivered using CALF support has increased significantly year on year, along with Exchequer funding to support AHBs to access finance for the provision of new social housing.</p><p>Delivery under CALF since 2014 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>CALF</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Homes Delivered</td><td>319</td><td>374</td><td>566</td><td>1,257</td><td>2,315</td></tr></table></p><p>At the end of Q4 2018, there were some 3,600 homes approved for delivery either by building or acquisition using CALF and P&amp;amp;A support, which are scheduled to be delivered out to 2022.  As of June 2019, &euro;284 million had been loaned by local authorities to AHBs as CALF funding and a further &euro;244 million has been approved for lending.</p><p>Owing to the nature of the CALF, home delivery does not always arise in the same year as expenditure is incurred. Schemes delivered under phased programmes may cross a number of payment periods. A provision of &euro;94.4 million is available for CALF in 2019. </p><p>Expenditure under CALF since 2014 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>CALF </th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Expenditure</td><td>4.447m</td><td>13.374m</td><td>35.677m</td><td>55.677m</td><td>120.881m</td></tr></table></p><p>In terms of social housing delivery, we are continuing to build on the significant progress that was made between 2016 and 2018 in terms of supporting new households. My Department is currently validating returns from all 31 local authorities and will shortly be publishing the local authority breakdown of delivery against targets for Quarter 1. </p><p>Indicative delivery outputs reflect that more than 5,800 additional housing supports have been provided in the first three months of this year across all of the various social housing delivery programmes, including build, acquisition, leasing, HAP and RAS. This includes more than 1,200 additional social homes provided by local authorities and AHBs under build, acquisition and leasing programmes.  </p><p>As you will be aware, my Department publishes a quarterly Construction Status Report. This report is a compendium of the new build programme across the 31 local authorities for new build social housing activity for the duration of Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p>By end 2018, the number of new build social homes now delivered or in the pipeline stood at over 19,000 of the overall build target of 33,600, with nearly 5,000 homes on site and under construction and a further 2,569 homes at the final pre-construction stage. The Quarter 1 2019 Report will be finalised in the coming days, and given the rate of new projects being added to the programme, going on site, and completing, I expect this to show a strong pipeline against the overall target.</p><p>Details of the annual social housing output for each of the local authority areas, as well as the specific output under each of the funding programmes, are available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.</p></reply>

The Wildlife Act affords protection to a range of habitats and species and provides for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade.  </p><p>The legislative framework in place to protect biodiversity is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477/2011, which also fall under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union and give a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA) aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. There are currently 18 SAC sites and 6 SPA sites designated in County Offaly. </p><p>These include the Slieve Bloom Mountains Nature Reserve, Ireland&rsquo;s largest state-owned Nature Reserve. It was established in 1985, so that it could be managed in such a way as to ensure the conservation of the mountain blanket bog ecosystem. In addition, the Nature Reserve is designated a Ramsar Wetland Site and a Council of Europe Biogenetic Reserve. Much of the greater upland area has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The primary interest of the SAC is mountain blanket bog. </p><p>The Slieve Bloom Mountains are also designated a Special Protection Area (SPA), of special conservation interest for the hen harrier, a rare bird of prey. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are operating &quot;the  Hen Harrier Project&quot; in 6 SPAs, including the Slieve Blooms, which aims to reward farmers for managing their land to favour the Hen Harrier. </p><p>Clara Bog in County Offaly is one of the best remaining examples of midland raised bog in Western Europe. The Clara Bog Nature Reserve Visitor Centre includes an interactive exhibition space and is open seasonally from May to October and admission is free to the public. </p><p>My Department is also responsible for developing and publishing Ireland's National Biodiversity Action Plan. The most recent Plan (Ireland's 3rd) was published in October 2017 and includes a number of actions aimed at assisting local authorities throughout the country in their efforts to protect and conserve biodiversity in their areas. Local authorities undertake much valuable work in this sphere and are an important element in the overall approach to halting biodiversity loss. </p><p>In support of the work carried out by local authorities, last February I announced at the National Biodiversity Conference a commitment in the coming years to double the funding my Department makes available for local Heritage and Biodiversity Officers to implement biodiversity actions at local level and to tackle invasive species. I am pleased that the pilot grant scheme, introduced in 2018, to assist local authority led biodiversity projects will be extended with increased funding in 2019.</p><p>In 2018, under this grant scheme, Offaly County Council received biodiversity funding of &euro;13,600 from my Department for the conducting of Swift surveys; support for the All Ireland Pollinator Plan; Tidy Towns support; and conducting workshops in schools and preschools. They also received additional funding of &euro;4,800 for the control of Himalayan Balsam, as part of a local invasive alien species project.</p><p><b></b>I look forward to local authorities, including Offaly County Council, using the funding available in 2019 in their areas to support locally led and targeted biodiversity projects, supporting the implementation of our National Biodiversity Action Plan and raising awareness of biodiversity generally. The allocation of these grants will be announced in the coming weeks.</p></reply>
