These bodies have also examined how health professionals and community welfare officers could assist the scheme. It should be noted however that none of the options around verification are straightforward, and we must be cognisant of data minimisation where sensitive personal medical information is involved.   It is disappointing that it has not yet been possible to implement a support measure. It is important for all those involved, including the representative organisations, that the support goes to the correct people and that the scheme is not dependent on applications that cannot be verified. </p>  <p>  A number of models of delivery have been explored, but challenges arose in all options. Significant personal data concerns, under the new GDPR arrangements, were raised in one case. High administration costs and procurement issues were also identified that would have been problematic in terms of getting the balance right between the prevention of fraudulent claims and the delivery of the scheme in a cost effective manner. Unfortunately, the absence of a database of persons who are in receipt of incontinence products from the HSE, which could be used to verify persons who are medically incontinent, has impacted on the delivery of a cost effective scheme. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the complex issues at play, which are understandable given the sensitive nature of the medical data in question, I would like assure the Deputy that I continue to be committed to address this issue. My Department is calling the stakeholders together on 13 June to discuss the matter further and a number of possible solutions to deliver this scheme.   </p></reply>

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&deg;C, published last October, confirmed that the international community has a limited window for real action to reduce emissions to ensure that current and future generations can live sustainably in a low-carbon and climate-resilient world.   In response to this challenge, the All of Government Climate Plan will set out how this Government intends to make Ireland climate resilient across our entire society. This will involve setting climate goals in all key sectors, including electricity, agriculture, transport, industry, buildings, waste and the public sector. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action.</p>  <p>  The Plan will lead to a significant step-up in policy ambition and delivery, to ensure that we at least meet our 2030 targets and get on a clear pathway to meeting our 2050 objectives. It will be updated every year and will also be informed by the recommendations contained in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action. </p>  <p>  The goals and targets will be informed by analysis of the most cost-effective choices available to reach our 2030 targets. By articulating a decarbonisation ambition range for each sector, the framework provided by the Plan will enable each sector to identify and put in place the most appropriate policy tools to deliver this stated ambition in order for Ireland to meet its 2030 targets.</p>  <p>  I intend that the Plan will be published over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The finalised Directive will be formally adopted shortly and has to be transposed by Member States within two years at which stage it becomes law. </p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to start work on the preparatory measures, legal and otherwise, needed to act on the implementation of the Directive when enacted. The Single Use Plastics Directive incorporates a wide range of measures. These include consumption reduction targets, product design, extended producer responsibilities, collection obligations, awareness raising measures, as well as the banning of some products, which will all have to be implemented between 2021 and 2030. </p>  <p>In addition, in advance of the publication of this Directive and with a view to showing leadership in dealing with this difficult waste stream, the Government decided that Government Departments would not purchase single-use plastic cups, cutlery and drinking straws from 1 January 2019. This decision was extended to all public bodies and commercial state agencies under the aegis of Ministers with effect from 1 April 2019.   </p></reply>

These include:</p><p>- An annual waste enforcement grant of &euro;7.4 million to support the recruitment and retention of 150 local authority waste enforcement personnel across the country; </p><p>- The establishment of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities;</p><p>- The establishment of a National Waste Enforcement Steering Committee which facilitates more co-ordinated multi agency operations taking place on a regional basis.</p><p>In addition, my Department has developed the Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations. </p><p>I recently announced funding of &euro;3 million for the 2019 Anti-Dumping Initiative, an increase of 50% on last year, to support communities around the country to continue to tackle illegal dumping. Innovation, surveillance using drones, special collections for awkward items like mattresses, spreading awareness among young people and recognising the work of volunteers will play a role in this year&rsquo;s campaign. </p><p>There will be a special emphasis on targeting dumping blackspots and illegal operators. Since 2017, the Anti-Dumping Initiative has supported the removal of some 5,000 tonnes of illegal waste from some of the country&rsquo;s most notorious fly tipping black-spots and approximately 50% of this year&rsquo;s funding will go towards continuing to tackle this problem.</p></reply>

The Plan will set out the necessary policy measures to help meet our 2030 target and will put Ireland on a clear pathway to meeting our 2050 objectives. This will require both public and private investment, and large societal shifts in technology, attitude and behaviour. It will also involve a shift in which renewable technologies we support and a shift towards a more distributed generation system, including community participation and a focus on the energy &lsquo;prosumer&rsquo;.    The Plan will include a roadmap for how we enable micro generation, with a particular emphasis on self-consumption, as this is where the value of electricity produced by micro generators is of most value, both for the consumer, in terms of reduced electricity costs, and for the grid in terms of reduced fossil fuel imports. </p>  <p>  In July 2018, my Department launched a new micro-generation scheme to support domestic customers who install solar photovoltaic panels in their homes. The pilot scheme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, will be subject to a review in the coming months at which time the costs of installation will be assessed and further opportunities to broaden this scheme to other groups and other technologies will be explored. Potential future phases of support for micro-generation in Ireland may include a tariff, as we align with the ambition of the recast Renewable Energy Directive which recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers.</p>  <p>  Last year government approved the High Level Design of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will provide pathways for communities to participate in and benefit from renewable electricity generation.</p></reply>

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the decision of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban nationwide. Banning the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality and public health, particularly in built up areas. </p><p>I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. High levels of particulate matter arise from a number of sources, including the burning of smoky coal. </p><p>I have also asked the EPA for a report on air quality in areas not currently covered by the smoky coal ban.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 74% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband.    The NBP State intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network over a 25 year period. The intervention area comprises approximately 540,000 premises and includes 1.1 million people. Following rigorous evaluation by the Department, I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May. </p>  <p>  The Government decision means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to the contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p>  <p>  In the first year of this roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. A deployment plan will be made available by the bidder once the contract is signed. The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by end of the second year of the overall deployment, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p></reply>

When my Department conducted its mapping exercise in 2014 the consultation documents listed some examples of potential connection points in local communities. This principle was incorporated into the procurement process.    These key locations in rural communities will be connected with high speed broadband in year one of the NBP State intervention deployment while waiting for the wider deployment to reach their area. These locations are called Broadband Connection Points (BCPs).There will be approximately 300 nationwide. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county, to provide a community-based high speed broadband service in year one of the National Broadband Plan State intervention deployment.

The main objectives of this Platform are to enable multi-stakeholder dialogue on policy frameworks for successful transformation of carbon-intensive regions, and to facilitate the development of strategies and projects in areas such as investment for structural transformation, growth and jobs. Once the Midlands Region is included on the Platform for Coal and Carbon Intensive Regions in Transition, it is expected that a team of European Commission and external experts would be assigned to assist the relevant State bodies with refining project ideas and implementation strategies, including feedback on relevant EU policies, programmes, funds and financing instruments.

The availability of ubiquitous high speed broadband will bring significant benefits in areas of e-Health, e-Education, smart farming, regional development and tourism.   The National Broadband Plan procurement process was technology neutral, as required under State Aid Guidelines for Broadband. This means it did not specify a preferred technology. However, all bidders in the process proposed fibre as the best solution. Fibre can meet the requirements set out in the NBP but also can be upgraded for additional capacity over time at low additional cost to network operators.</p>  <p>  The basic product that will be offered on the State intervention network will be 150 megabits per second (Mbps), which is comparable to fibre networks in urban areas. The network is designed with a roadmap to upgrade the services over 25 years, including upgrades to increase residential speeds to 300Mbps by Year 6 of the contract and 500Mbps by year 10. This ensures the network is future proofed to meet requirements in years to come. A product of 1 Gigabit per second is also available to businesses and any residential homes that may require it.</p>  <p>  Fibre can deliver up to 10 Gigabit per second speed with no major upgrades required, ensuring that the solution is future proofed and has a low running cost, making it an extremely efficient solution. Other broadband technologies such as 4G, 5G or fixed wireless, may be deployed to connect premises in limited circumstances where fibre is not cost-effective - for example for extremely remote or difficult to connect homes.</p>  <p>My Department considered other technologies than fibre and agreed with the national and international expertise in this area that a fibre-based solution was the most economical way to address all premises with a future-proofed solution over the 25 years of the contract, ensuring there is no need for a further State investment in the short term to replace an obsolete technology.   </p></reply>

National Broadband Ireland is obliged to seek the written consent of the Minister prior to the occurrence of a Change in Ownership of NBI that occurs at any time from the commencement of the contract up until one year after the completion of deployment. After the one year anniversary of the completion of deployment, the shares of NBI can be sold without Ministerial consent but not to Unsuitable Third Parties.</p><p>  Unsuitable Third Parties include excluded parties specifically set out in EU procurement regulations, parties involved in the arms trade, parties who have been convicted of a criminal offence related to business, parties who have failed to comply with tax rules and parties whose activities pose a threat to national security. Also, if any shareholder has a contingent commitment to make a loan or equity or capital contribution to NBI, NBI is required, until that commitment has been delivered, to seek the written consent of the Minister to a Change in Ownership which results in the shareholder ceasing to have Control (i.e. a 30% shareholding or equivalent level of control) of NBI.</p><p>NBI is obliged to notify the Minister of any Change in Ownership throughout the life of the Contract and there are provisions in the Contract in relation to clawback payments in the event of a sale of NBI prior to contract year 10. </p><p>  If a Change in Ownership occurs, NBI (in new ownership) will continue to be bound by the NBP Contract.</p><p>  The Minister can terminate the NBP Contract and take ownership of NBI if there is an un-remedied change in ownership of NBI in breach of the NBP Contract. </p><p>  The Minister will also have a priority (1st ranking) security over the shares in NBI. This creates a practical inhibitor on the shareholder disposing of those shares without the Minister being satisfied that the disposal is consistent with the Contract.</p><p>  The Minister will also have priority (1st ranking) security over the Assets of NBI throughout the term of the NBP Contract. This means in practical terms that any material fixed Assets which NBI requires to perform the NBP Contract cannot be sold without the Minister&rsquo;s consent.</p></reply>

It will also provide opportunities for better connectivity for remote healthcare facilities such as small health centres, community pharmacies, and GP practices located in rural areas.   Some care previously provided in hospitals may be transferred to the home as the use of wearables and other interactive devices allow the remote monitoring of vital signs or even administration of medicine. Remote monitoring can complement medical healthcare and reduce the requirement to attend day clinics far away from people's homes. It can also accelerate early discharge and relieve pressure in hospitals and hospices. This is important to create bed capacity and reduce long term stays in hospitals. </p>  <p>  Faster connectivity can also facilitate ongoing professional development for healthcare professionals and provide access to experienced colleagues via video conferencing and better access to digital medical databases no matter the location of the medical professional. </p>  <p>The successful deployment of the NBP is one of the key pillars to delivery of a more efficient, effective and lower cost health system in Ireland.  </p></reply>

A period of final due diligence on all elements of the contract is part of the normal conclusion of a procurement process. A number of additional elements need to be concluded before the contract can be signed.</p>  <p>  For example, NBI will be supported by a number of experienced subcontractors and is currently tasked with finalising negotiations on contracts with approximately 40 subcontractors to assist in the delivery of the NBP. In order to support deployment it is anticipated that a subset of approximately 15 to 20 of these subcontracts will be required prior to contract close.

The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 premises each year thereafter until roll out is completed. The ultimate take-up of the service is estimated to be around 80%. This will be driven by linking payment of subsidy to verification of connections made by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) as well as passing premises in the Intervention Area. There are also requirements in the contract around demand stimulation and stakeholder engagement to drive take up. </p>  <p>  The nearest comparison in relation to take up is the eir 300k rural deployment. Take up of this service is in line with the trajectory anticipated by eir when it planned the rural fibre rollout. The rate of take up along eir's 300k deployment has increased throughout 2018 and is expected to increase further as eir proceeds to pass and connect further premises every month and as awareness of the availability of high speed broadband improves and retailers offer a choice and variety of communications packages over the network. There is nothing to suggest that demand in the intervention area would differ from the demand for high speed broadband in urban areas, or in the eir 300k deployment area. </p>  <p>In addition, the bidder was required to develop and analyse the demand for their service. This included profiling of demographics, surveys and benchmarking exercises. The bidder carried out a market analysis of the end-users in the intervention area as well as a benchmarking analysis for the demand for a high speed broadband service by those likely end-users.

The National Broadband Plan highlights the importance of remote working opportunities to regenerate, revitalise and re-establish rural Ireland as an attractive place to live and work.  </p></reply>

It is an innovative project-based programme which encourages students in post-primary schools to use technology to solve day to day challenges in their schools and wider communities.   Over the past two years a number of students have identified the issue of online safety as their chosen School Digital Champion project. They have developed websites and information sessions within their school to inform students about Internet safety and to raise awareness of their digital footprint. </p>  <p>  During the 2018 and 2019 Programme, presentations on online safety formed part of the project showcase event attended by students and teachers. I welcome the inclusion of online safety at these events as it is provides an opportunity to promote awareness of a number of resources and supports available to schools on this issue.</p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, sets out the Department of Education and Skills policy on the effective use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment. A key action of the strategy is the promotion of the responsible and ethical use of the Internet and related technologies.</p>  <p>  Awareness on online safety for schools is carried out by the Professional Development Service for Teachers technology in education (PDST) in partnership with the safer Internet Ireland project. Webwise, an online safety initiative co-funded by the Department of Education and Skills and operated by PDST, promotes the autonomous, effective and safer use of the Internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy that targets parents, teachers and children with consistent and relevant messages, including guidance on acceptable usage in schools. A range of resources has been developed which helps teachers integrate online safety into teaching and learning in their schools. </p></reply>

It is clear from the CBA that has been carried out that even in a pessimistic scenario, the benefits of this investment will outweigh the costs. A CBA Benefits report and a detailed benefits calculation annex was published in 2015 by my Department as part of the approval to launch the procurement process. All updates to the 2015 CBA were shared with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) and the final CBA has been published by my Department this May.The CBA has been developed and updated over the last four years. It was only through detailed engagement with the market through the 800 hours of dialogue with all bidders and through receiving the final tender submission by Granahan McCourt, that it was possible to finalise the published CBA which remains positive, even in the pessimistic scenario. </p><p>There was also significant engagement between my Department and its advisers and the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on behalf of DPER on the CBA. The development of the CBA has incorporated feedback from IGEES and DPER officials. </p><p>There are challenges in applying the PSC to a bespoke project such as the NBP however, all of the benefits included in the CBA are consistent with the PSC Guidelines and generally accepted approached to CBAs of this nature. </p><p>PwC have provided all necessary assurances to my Department that the final CBA provided to the DPER is accurate for all known costs and benefits allowed for under the PSC and is fully compliant with the PSC.</p><p>The CBA has taken a very conservative view on the future benefits, for example it assumes there will be no growth in remote working compared to that carried out today. The following benefits are not included:</p><p>- Expansion of remote working</p><p>- Remote health monitoring &amp;amp; diagnosis</p><p>- Cloud based service and connected devices</p><p>- Digital learning</p><p>-  Smart farming</p><p>-  Realising the benefits of e-government.</p></reply>

A resilient and well connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic wellbeing and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.   In December 2016 An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the project in Ireland, while in January 2018 full planning permission was granted for the section of the line that lies in Northern Ireland. Both of the planning decisions have been subject to legal proceedings in each jurisdiction. In Ireland a Supreme Court appeal of the planning permission was dismissed on 19 February 2019. In Northern Ireland, on 8 February 2019, the Department for Infrastructure asked the High Court to quash the planning permission given so the planning application can be re-determined under new legislation introduced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in November 2018.</p>  <p>There are currently a number of on-going procurements in relation to the project being undertaken and managed by ESB Networks, such as tower design. However no critical procurement contracts such as construction will be concluded until all planning issues in Northern Ireland are resolved. The earliest possible date for construction to commence is early 2020.  </p></reply>

The availability of ubiquitous high speed broadband will bring significant benefits in areas of e-Health, e-Education, smart farming, regional development and tourism.   Following rigorous evaluation by the Department, I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May. </p>  <p>  The Government decision means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to the contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p>  <p>  Roll out of the National Broadband Plan State intervention to the approximately 44,000 businesses in the intervention area will take place against the backdrop of a significant and rapid transformation in the structure of global and national economies. Technology and digitisation are developing rapidly and are expected to radically change many jobs, enterprises and even entire sectors </p>  <p>  A growing number of businesses and industries, particularly digitally intensive enterprises, will need Gigabit connectivity to create new applications and business models to produce, distribute and sell their goods and services more competitively. From manufacturing systems to ordering and delivery processes, from data storage and analytics to internal and external communications, their future competitiveness requires cost-effective access to such connectivity. The State intervention will provide this connectivity to businesses from day one of connection. </p>  <p>  One of the key elements of the NBP Intervention Strategy is a requirement to put forward specific speeds and connection times to meet the needs of the business community. </p>  <p>  Large service providers and multinationals are moving businesses towards a more cloud based office where data is stored and backed up centrally on a cloud based server. The remote worker will need to be able to efficiently access the cloud based office, use the office applications and upload their own content quickly and easily. In addition, high upload performance increases the usability of order placement services, secure online banking, backing up and archiving of activities and uploading content for sharing or resale. However, critical to all users is certainty of availability similar to the need to have confidence of supply of power. When working from home or running a business, it is essential that your broadband service is constantly available and where issues arise such issues are resolved quickly. </p>  <p>  The predominantly fibre solution proposed by the Preferred Bidder in the NBP will facilitate and support these types of business services and the network to be built will provide that confidence and assurance to all businesses in the Intervention Area.  </p></reply>

I can confirm that a response to our request was provided by that Department on 12 April.    My Department communicated our observations and outlined our appropriate concerns in the context of our statutory responsibilities, and those of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), for the protection of wild salmon and their habitat as well as our obligations under the EU Habitats Directive and the convention of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO). </p>  <p>  My Department receives monthly sea-lice reports in a timely fashion from the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine and, following consultation with Inland Fisheries Ireland, communicates any concerns in similar fashion. In relation to this report, our concerns were heightened at the reported very elevated lice levels at a number of fish farms during the critical migration period for wild Atlantic salmon, a protected species under the Habitats Directive. </p>  <p>Scientific research both in Ireland and internationally indicates that the impact on vulnerable wild salmon smolts (juveniles), during outward migration to distant feeding grounds, of heavy sea lice infestation can have a highly damaging effect on the numbers of these juveniles that survive and return to their natal river to spawn and create the next generation of fish which are genetically unique to that river. Recent peer reviewed research internationally has shown that sea lice emanating from fish farms can add up to an additional 39% mortality on these salmon smolts.   </p></reply>

The measure applies across the public service, including the Defence Forces. However, it does not apply in relation to employment with the commercial semi-State bodies or where public service pensioners are employed outside the public service.</p>  <p>  Pension abatement in the public service is structured to ensure that a pensioner's combined earnings from their current public service job plus their existing public service retirement pension do not exceed the current equivalent of pensionable salary from their old public service job. Depending on those variables, the actual impact (if any) from the measure on a person&rsquo;s public service pension will vary from person to person.  For example, where a person&rsquo;s combined public service earnings from their current job plus pension are less than the current equivalent of their pensionable earnings from their old job e.g. in the Defence Forces, there is no reduction of pension.</p>  <p>  I should point out that prior to 1 November 2012, this abatement principle / concept already operated as a standard feature of public service pension schemes generally.  However, this was only within individual sectors and bodies where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former occupation, e.g. Defence Forces, Garda, Civil Service etc. The 2012 Act extends the principle across and between all sectors without exception, thereby restoring the arrangements that were in place until 1965.</p>  <p>  I should also state that a public service pensioner already in public service employment immediately before 1 November 2012 is not affected by the change while he or she remains in that post/position.  However, if their employment status changes after that date, for example, where they secure a new post through promotion with their current public service employer or where they move to a different post or public service body, their pension is subject to abatement in accordance with the legislation.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the question of any changes to that Act would therefore be a matter for him in the first instance.</p></reply>

Much of this activity involves the provision of emergency medical services. The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) is the regulator for emergency medical services in Ireland and their role is to protect the public. The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council require organisations that wish to be operational to apply to them for an annual licence to operate. Civil Defence is currently licenced by PHECC up to 30 July 2019.</p>  <p>  In advance of the renewal process in November 2018, my officials reviewed the statutory declaration. That review identified that some assurances and details required as part of the licensing process are not within the control or remit of the Department of Defence as responsibility for Civil Defence operations rests with local authorities as set out in the 2015 Government White Paper on Defence.</p>  <p>  There has been ongoing engagement on this issue between my officials, senior officials from the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) and with representatives of the Local Authorities through the County and City Management Association (CCMA) since early this year.</p>  <p>  The most recent engagement was on Wednesday 15 May 2019.  At that meeting, there was continued positive engagement in line with the clear desire from all parties to resolve the issue, to ensure the emergency medical services provided by Civil Defence volunteers can continue. Further engagement will take place over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the excellent service Civil Defence volunteers provide in terms of emergency medical services in emergency and non-emergency events continues beyond 30 July 2019 and I am confident all three parties can reach agreement, while recognising the unique structure of the Civil Defence organisation.</p></reply>

Agreed on Europe Day, the Declaration recalls key achievements of the EU and sets out 10 commitments to guide the decisions that leaders will take about the future.</p><p>At the same time, leaders discussed strategic priorities for the coming years, with a view to adopting the EU Strategic Agenda 2019-2024 at the June European Council.  The Strategic Agenda will guide the work of the Union over the next five years.</p><p>Preparations for Ireland's contribution to the new Strategic Agenda have been under way since late 2017, when the Minister of State for European Affairs and I joined the Taoiseach in launching a citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe.  There was extensive engagement across the country last year and a narrative report on the citizens' dialogue process was published in October.</p><p>On foot of this report, my Department, together with the Department of the Taoiseach, held consultations with Departments across Government earlier this year.  Discussions were also held as part of this process in the Interdepartmental Group on the European Union and Brexit, which consists of senior representatives of all Government Departments and the Office of the Attorney General. The Group focuses on current issues on the EU agenda, including the new Strategic Agenda.</p><p>Following these discussions, <i>Ireland's National Statement on the European Union</i>was approved by the Cabinet last month.  The <i>National Statement</i>is Ireland's contribution to the new Strategic Agenda.  It has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and was the subject of statements in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann just before the Easter recess.</p><p>It is expected, as I have indicated, that the EU Strategic Agenda 2019-2024 will be adopted at the European Council next month and discussion on the draft text, which began in Sibiu, will continue in the meantime.  The Government will prioritise work, including engagement with partners, on the issues which will be highlighted in the Strategic Agenda and in the incoming Commission&rsquo;s work programme.</p></reply>

The Commission&rsquo;s annual assessments are based on careful analysis and monitoring, drawing on a continuous dialogue with the Romanian authorities and with other EU countries, civil society, international organisations, independent experts and a variety of other interlocutors.</p>  <p>  Romania was deemed to have made good progress over a number of years.  However, over the past three years the European Commission has conveyed concerns to the Romanian Government.  Earlier this month, Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans wrote to the Romanian President, the Presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and the Prime Minister, setting out in some detail the Commission&rsquo;s opinion that various legislative amendments, which have mostly been introduced via emergency ordinances that bypass normal stakeholder consultations, have contributed to the weakening of judicial independence and the fight against corruption and crime. He warned that unless corrective measures were quickly applied, or if further negative steps were taken, the Commission would initiate the Rule of Law Framework enabling dialogue between the two sides aimed at avoiding the triggering of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union.  The Rule of Law Framework would temporarily replace the CVM process, although it would take account of the CVM benchmarks and recommendations.  Mr. Timmermans also noted that the CVM would remain operational into the future, until its benchmarks and recommendations were fully and satisfactorily met.  Furthermore, the letter warned that the Commission would act swiftly in response to any EU Treaty infringements by Romania.</p>  <p>  Ireland shares the objectives of the Commission, which are to help the Romanian authorities find solutions to the rule of law issues that have emerged, and to resume and indeed accelerate progress towards meeting the CVM benchmarks and recommendations.  The Irish Embassy in Bucharest and Embassies of twelve like-minded countries issued a joint statement in April, which called on all parties involved in drafting emergency Government ordinances to avoid legislative changes that would weaken the rule of law and Romania&rsquo;s ability to fight crime and corruption. Legislative changes currently under consideration risk breaching common European values, undermining the rule of law, and negatively impacting on Romania&rsquo;s economic development and the well-being of its citizens. We have urged the Romanian Government to take into account the steps recommended by the European Commission, the European Parliament, the EU Council, and the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Venice Commission and GRECO. The fact that Romania currently holds the EU Presidency places Romania in a special position of responsibility, and we have urged the Romanian Government to reaffirm political commitment to our shared values. Action on these issues is in the interests not only of the people of Romania, but of the EU as a whole.</p></reply>

A significant number of civilians were also internally displaced within Rakhine and 128,000 people remain in IDP camps having fled previous bouts of violence. This exodus of refugees and internal displacement was accompanied by widespread and credible claims of serious human rights violations in Rakhine State by the Myanmar Security Forces.</p><p>Recent months have again seen an escalation of violence in Rakhine State and neighbouring Chin State related to ongoing conflict between the Myanmar Security Forces and ethnic armed groups. The situation remains unstable with increasing violence generating further displacement of civilians.</p><p>In response, through both bilateral contacts with Myanmar and through our memberships of the UN and EU, Ireland has deployed political pressure to address this crisis.  Most recently, this has included calling on the Myanmar government to urgently establish greater access to these communities for UN agencies and humanitarian NGOs in order to fully assess and address the needs of civilians, who remain in areas of conflict and have been traumatically affected by recent events.</p><p>  The EU Foreign Affairs Council has adopted several sets of Council Conclusions addressing gross human rights violations in Myanmar&rsquo;s Kachin, Rakhine and Shan States. The Conclusions called on Myanmar to hold those responsible for these crimes to account and to take meaningful action towards the creation of conditions conducive to a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of those displaced to their places of origin.  The EU has also put in place targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar Security Forces responsible for these acts. In addition, the European Commission is currently reviewing Myanmar&rsquo;s trade preferences under the framework of the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme.</p><p>  Ireland has also worked closely with UN and EU partners to push for accountability for the human rights violations that have occurred. In September 2018, the Human Rights Council adopted a Resolution, proposed jointly by the EU and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, mandating a new impartial independent mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the most serious violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. This is an important step in facilitating fair and independent criminal proceedings for these crimes.</p><p>Ireland has strongly and consistently pressed for unhindered humanitarian access to affected areas and continues to provide humanitarian support for the Rohingya community both in Myanmar and Bangladesh. For 2019, Ireland has already contributed &euro;1 million to the UNHCR response to the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh, building on funding of &euro;2.3 million since 2017. Ireland&rsquo;s support has also included the provision of advisers to UN agencies through the Rapid Response Initiative<b>.</b>We are also the 8<sup>th</sup>largest contributor to the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund, which has provided more than &euro;37 million in humanitarian assistance in Bangladesh and Rakhine State since 2017.</p><p>  The best long-term framework for a sustainable solution that addresses the concerns of the Rohingya, including the key issue of securing citizenship rights and the protection that accrues, remains the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State that was led by Kofi Annan.</p><p>Last month, Ambassador to Thailand and Myanmar, Tony Cotter, met with State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and discussed the current situation in Rakhine State and international concerns. Officials in my Department, including in the Embassy of Ireland in Thailand, will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

Actions to promote gender equality are at the core of A Better World, which provides for a number of new initiatives, including building on Ireland&rsquo;s strong record of delivery in the health area and in reducing the incidence of, and the effects of, HIV/AIDS.</p>  <p>  The Sustainable Development Goals state that achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights is essential, with goals 3.7 and 5.6 particularly relevant.  Achieving this will transform women&rsquo;s health outcomes. Evidence and hard data demonstrate the substantial health benefits associated with the provision of services in this area, in terms of decreased rates of maternal mortality and of unintended pregnancies.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s existing development partnerships with, among others, UNFPA; UNAIDS - whose work is particularly critical at this time of global challenges related to HIV and AIDS, and where young adolescent girls are most at risk of infection; UNESCO for their work on Comprehensive Sexuality Education with a particular focus in countries in sub-Saharan Africa; and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, provide the platform for Ireland&rsquo;s delivery of our responsibility to assist others achieve SDG goals 3.7 and 5.6.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a consistent and committed supporter of UNFPA&rsquo;s global efforts. In October 2018, the T&aacute;naiste announced Ireland&rsquo;s intention to increase the core funding of UNFPA by &euro;700,000 bring the 2018 total to &euro;3.5 million. This total has been maintained in 2019 and is a demonstration of our support for the work of the agency. This funding can be allocated by UNFPA across the key priority areas of its Strategic Plan, which includes addressing Female Genital Mutilation and Cutting (FGM/C). Ireland also provides core funding to UNICEF which, together with UNFPA, leads the largest global programme to accelerate the abandonment of FGM and is currently focussed on 17 African countries.</p>  <p>  2019 marks the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), which took place in Cairo in 1994. At that conference, 179 governments, including Ireland, adopted a Programme of Action recognising that reproductive health, women's empowerment and gender equality are the pathway to sustainable development.  This Programme of Action informed the agreement of SDG goals 3.7 and 5.6.  The upcoming Nairobi International Conference on Population and Development will mark 25 years since Cairo.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with UNFPA on its plans for Nairobi, including during the recent visit to Ireland of the Executive Director of UNFPA, who praised Ireland&rsquo;s work in the developing world and in particular saying that &lsquo;You defend women and girls&rsquo;.  It is intended that Ireland would have high-level political representation at Nairobi.</p></reply>

In fact the vast majority of applications are processed in a considerably shorter time period.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service aims to process all passport renewal applications submitted via Passport Express within 15 working days. At present, renewal applications through Passport Express are being processed in an average time of 16 working days, excluding postage time.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently in its peak season for passport demand with the vast majority of applications being received between February and August each year. From January to April this year, the Passport Service has seen a 16% increase in passport applications compared to the same four month period in 2018. The number of passport applications is expected to continue to increase throughout 2019.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken by the Passport Service to manage the increase in demand including the recruitment of additional staff, the continuous implementation of technological and service improvements and the re-organisation of production processes and administrative arrangements.</p>  <p>   At the end of 2018, the Passport Service employed 363.2 Full Time Equivalent staff. This is an increase of over 40 staff since the same point in 2017. Already this year, over 90 additional Full Time Equivalent staff have taken up roles in the Passport Service. Targeted overtime has been sanctioned for both permanent and temporary staff when required. The Passport Service has received approval to recruit over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) in 2019 to assist in processing passport applications and to deal with the queries from the general public. A dedicated Customer Service Hub has been established to deal with queries from the public and additional staff have been allocated.</p>  <p>  The Passport Reform Programme continues to deliver major upgrades to the Passport Service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements. The award winning Online Passport Renewal Service has been the most significant project launched under the Programme to date. The second phase of the Online Passport Renewal Service was rolled out in November 2018. The online facility now allows for the renewal of children's passports and has expanded the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. The online service brings significant benefits to citizens with faster turnaround times and greater customer satisfaction. The online service has been instrumental in the management of overall passport operations and in allowing the passport service to allocate staff resources more efficiently to cope with unprecedented demand. Other projects that will advance in 2019 include the development of business process automation, document management systems and the roll out of mailing machines.</p></reply>

Since 2011, the Syria conflict has cost the lives of well over 400,000 people. As the conflict enters its ninth year, nearly 12 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, and more than 80 per cent of people live below the poverty line. Over 6 million people are displaced inside Syria, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. Other groups, most notably ISIS, have also perpetrated atrocities. </p>  <p>  While the conflict had been less intense in recent months, in recent weeks there has been an escalation of the conflict in the north-west of Syria, in the area around Idlib. Conflict there between the regime and other armed groups has displaced almost 200,000 people, has killed over 100 civilians, and has left hundreds injured. I condemn in particular the airstrikes that are reported to have targeted medical facilities and schools. </p>  <p>  All parties must uphold their ceasefire commitments and cease military activities in the Idlib region. Any attempt at a purely military approach to the situation there risks endangering hundreds of thousands of others. Those with influence on the Syrian regime have a responsibility to exert pressure to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU firmly believe that eight years of war have shown that military action cannot bring lasting peace to Syria. We support the UN-led efforts to bring about a political resolution to the conflict, in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council Resolution 2254. What is needed to bring a sustainable end to the violence is a Syrian-owned and Syrian-led process. The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. </p>  <p>  The UN Special Envoy&rsquo;s efforts are currently focused on establishing a constitutional committee, made up of Syrians of different political views, to chart the way forward for the country and unlock a broader political process. The UN Special Envoy has been engaging directly with Russia, Turkey and Iran on this, and we believe that they have a responsibility to support and assist his efforts. </p>  <p>  At the EU-League of Arab States Ministerial meeting in February, I raised the ongoing conflict in Syria with my EU and Arab counterparts. At the EU-League of Arab States Summit in Egypt later that month, which the Taoiseach attended, EU and Arab countries reaffirmed their commitment to the UN-led process in Syria, and agreed that any sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict requires a genuine political transition. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent donor to the Syria crisis response and our overall funding supports those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region. In March 2019, Ireland pledged a further &euro;25 million to the crisis, bringing the total amount of humanitarian assistance committed to the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis. To date, Ireland has disbursed &euro;138m of this funding. Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.</p></reply>

Following US withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA) last year, both Ireland and the EU conveyed our great regret at the decision to the US Government, and have maintained that view. Ireland has clearly expressed our belief that there is no credible peaceful alternative to the JCPOA, which we believe was a significant diplomatic achievement, and one which Iran was in full compliance with, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Middle East is a safer region with the JCPOA in operation, and would be less safe without it.</p>  <p>  Ireland shares broader concerns expressed by the United States about some Iranian behaviour in the region, most notably in relation to Iran&rsquo;s activities on ballistic missiles, and support for militant groups, especially in Syria and Yemen. However, Ireland believes that none of these concerns can be better addressed without the JCPOA in place. </p>  <p>  I join my EU colleagues in regretting the continuing US efforts to tighten general economic sanctions on Iran, and Iran&rsquo;s subsequent decision to partially suspend its operation of some commitments under the JCPOA. Ireland and the EU will continue to endeavour to ensure the effective implementation of the JCPOA and adherence to its commitments by all parties.  </p>  <p>  On 13 May, US Secretary of State Pompeo met with High Representative Mogherini in Brussels. HR/VP Mogherini urged the United States to exercise maximum restraint as tensions mount between the US and Iran and stressed the need for diplomatic dialogue. She reiterated the EU's continuing commitment to the JCPOA.</p>  <p>  The Government and the European Union will continue to monitor tensions between the US and Iran, and where the opportunity arises with both Governments and relevant interlocutors, will encourage a return to amicable and constructive communication. This is clearly a situation of concern, but equally we should not ourselves contribute to raising the temperature. I continue to believe that neither the US nor Iran is seeking to move towards conflict.</p></reply>

Non Arctic States and other bodies can apply to become Observers, of which there are currently thirty nine - thirteen States and twenty six other groups.</p>  <p>   The Arctic Council carries out important work in a number of areas which are of interest to Ireland, including the environment, biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development. </p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to carry out a scoping exercise on the value and feasibility of Ireland applying for Observer Status at the Arctic Council, together with a consideration of the commitments and engagement it would involve.  The Department and relevant Embassies have been engaging with Members and Observer Members of the Arctic Council and with stakeholders in Ireland on interest in broader engagement in the Arctic region, including on the obligations and merits of a possible application for observer status in the future.  Observer status at the Arctic Council would involve not just the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but also other Government Departments, agencies and other stakeholders, so wide engagement is required before making a decision on a recommendation to Government.</p>  <p>   We hope to conclude this work later this year and the decision on whether or not to apply for observer status will be made on a solid understanding of the engagement and commitment required, and how Ireland could contribute positively to the work of the Council.</p>  <p>  Applications for Observership of the Council are submitted to the incumbent Council Chair three months before the bi-annual Ministerial meeting, next slated to take place in Iceland in May 2021.  The application must be accompanied by a memorandum setting out the proposed Observer&rsquo;s ability to contribute to the work of the Council.

However, the deepening political impasse in the UK since then, and the failure to date of the UK Parliament to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement, has raised the risk of a no deal departure from the EU in October. This scenario remains a serious concern and we are preparing accordingly. </p>  <p>  The Government, across all Departments, will continue its planning, both at home and at EU level, for all possible scenarios. Government Departments and State Agencies have been preparing for Brexit since the 2016 referendum in the UK and will continue to do so, through extensive contingency planning and stakeholder engagement. </p>  <p>  The immediate focus since December 2018 has been on ensuring the necessary contingency measures are in place to limit the potential negative impacts of a no deal Brexit. Much of this work, details of which were published in the Government's December 2018 Brexit Contingency Action Plan and subsequent updates, will continue to be relevant in any Brexit scenario.  The period afforded by the agreed extension is being used to further deepen our no deal responses and to and add to or refine completed measures to maximise readiness for a no deal scenario. Many of the preparatory measures undertaken by businesses are good general business practice, and would be of benefit in any scenario.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that legislative provisions have been passed by the Oireachtas in the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 and remain ready to be deployed if and when required.</p>  <p>  Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will have a significant impact on Ireland.

A Better World reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment, as outlined in Global Ireland 2025, to expand Ireland's official development assistance and make progress on delivering the United Nations target of allocating 0.7 percent of Gross National Income (GNI) for official development assistance by 2030. </p><p>A Better World provides the framework for this expansion. Based on current projections for economic growth, which may change as circumstances evolve, achieving the 0.7% target by 2030 would mean a tripling of the current allocations to ODA, and would require sustained, substantial managed annual increments given that the point of departure is 0.3% of GNI this year.  Difficult choices will be required between competing priorities and ongoing careful planning and consultation with other Government Departments and stakeholders will be needed if this level of ambition is to be realised.</p><p>Good progress is being made with allocations to official development assistance increased by 32% since 2014. Budget 2019 saw the highest increase in funding available in over a decade, with Irish official development assistance in 2019 to reach almost &euro;817 million, an increase of approximately &euro;110 million and a 16% increase on the allocation announced in budget 2018.</p><p>The table sets out indicative allocations to ODA, based on current economic growth forecasts, which show a possible phased path to reaching the 0.7% target by 2030.  Allocations will be decided annually as part of the normal budgetary process.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>ODA level &euro; Million  </th><th>Expected ODA/GNI % Target</th></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>817 </td><td>0.30% </td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>1400</td><td>0.50% </td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>1800 </td><td>0.57% </td></tr><tr><td>2027</td><td>2100 </td><td>0.62%</td></tr><tr><td>2030</td><td>2500</td><td>0.70% </td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am aware of this situation and of the broader climate of violence and intimidation which exists for political and community activists and leaders in Colombia, and I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Government of Colombia to investigate these cases in full. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland opened its new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; earlier this year. While Ireland&rsquo;s new Embassy&rsquo;s focus will be on developing the bilateral political and economic relationship with Colombia and on continuing to support the country&rsquo;s transition to a post-conflict society, having a permanent presence in Bogot&aacute; means that we will be much better positioned to monitor issues such as the situation of human rights defenders in the country. </p>  <p>  Officials at our new Embassy, as well as at my Department in Dublin, meet regularly with human rights leaders and civil society actors from across the country. The Embassy is following the situation in La Guajira closely and regularly engages with partner organisations in Colombia that are involved in monitoring human rights in this region. </p>  <p>  Embassy officials intend to visit La Guajira in the near future and meet with human rights defenders and civil society groups. We also regularly raise human rights concerns in our exchanges with the Government and official representatives of Colombia, including the situation of human rights defenders and community leaders.  </p>  <p>  Ireland also engages on the issue of intimidation and violence against human rights defenders and civil society actors at EU level. Former T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore in his position as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process, a role in which he is supported by my Department, recently led the 11th session of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue. </p>  <p>  Special Envoy Gilmore has visited the region of La Guajira in the past and, during this dialogue with representatives of the Colombian Government, he raised the alarmingly high figures of attacks against human rights defenders across the country. Particular reference was made to the disproportionately high level of violence against indigenous leaders, and the need for collective protection measures.  </p>  <p>  Ireland remains fully committed to supporting Colombia&rsquo;s transition to a peaceful post-conflict society, a key element of which is the vindication and protection of human, environmental and social rights. Significant challenges remain, but Ireland supports the full implementation of the peace agreement, which will ensure a more peaceful, stable and prosperous future for all Colombians.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has provided more than &euro;14 million in funding to Colombia since 2007, mainly channelled through the United Nations, and Colombian and international NGOs focusing on the areas of human rights, conflict prevention, peacebuilding and supporting livelihoods for rural populations. </p>  <p>  My Department provides funding directly to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia to support its important work in promoting and protecting human rights, including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions, as well as to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights, which provides protection measures to community leaders and activists operating in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America. </p>  <p>  Ireland was also a founding member of the EU Trust Fund for Colombia, and will contribute &euro;3 million over the five-year lifespan of the Fund. The Fund finances projects targeted at the marginalised rural areas of Colombia which have been most affected by conflict, and all projects incorporate a human rights and gender perspective.</p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed. Ireland sees our partnership with Colombia as a long-term commitment, and we will continue to strongly support the full implementation of the accords. </p>  <p>  We will continue to engage with the Colombian Government, EU and multilateral partners, and civil society groups and human rights defenders on this issue and on the broader human rights situation in the country. I can assure the Deputy of our continued commitment to assisting the Colombian people in their goal of achieving a brighter, more peaceful and more prosperous future for all Colombians.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-21a.221.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052100053#WRD02800"><p>At the outset it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the difficulties faced by returning emigrants in respect of motor insurance was recognised by the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s and was the subject of a particular recommendation.  In this regard, a protocol was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance in relation to returning emigrants, under which insurance companies committed to accepting the driving experience of such drivers gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  The details of it is available on Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s website and the websites of its member companies. </p>  <p>  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated differently to any other driver, subject to verification of their continued driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  Thus, a returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending that time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.  My Department continues to review the implementation of this recommendation through its regular engagement with Insurance Ireland.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific scenario in the Deputy&rsquo;s question more precisely, I understand that in general, insurance companies set a date by which a no-claims bonus will expire, where the driver has held no insurance in their own name for 2 or more years.  This applies whether the person continues to reside in Ireland, or they decide to move abroad and this is primarily a commercial matter for insurance companies.  The protocol recognises this scenario and states that if more than two years have passed since the Irish motor insurance policy was cancelled/lapsed, the Irish No Claims Discount is no longer valid.  Notwithstanding this, Insurance Ireland members have agreed through the protocol that if the person has claims-free driving experience in a different country in their own name, they will take this experience into consideration if that person seeks a quotation from an insurer, on their return to Ireland, subject to the appropriate verifiable documentation being provided.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I believe that the overall implementation of the CIWG&rsquo;s recommendations is having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance.  The latest CSO figures from April 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.4% lower than the July 2016 peak, consequently the average consumer should be seeing reductions when renewing their motor insurance.  In addition, I would note that representations made to my Department from returning emigrants have dropped significantly in the last year.  I am hopeful that this reflects that more are receiving insurance cover in line with the protocol referenced above.  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p></reply>

I would also note in particular the negative impact it could have on the marginal rates of tax, an important benchmark for the competitiveness of the income tax system overall.</p><p>I have been advised by Revenue that the estimated yields requested are as follows.</p><p>Regarding Question 21398/19, the estimated yield from tapering out the personal, PAYE and Earned Income credits by 1.43% per &euro;1,000 on individual income between &euro;100,000 and &euro;170,000 per year, resulting in no entitlement to these tax credits when income is greater than &euro;170,000, is estimated to be of the order of &euro;150m and &euro;180m for first and full year respectively. </p><p>Regarding Question 21399/19, the estimated yield from tapering out the personal, PAYE and Earned Income credits by 2.5% per &euro;1,000 on individual income between &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000 per year, resulting in no entitlement to these tax credits when income is greater than &euro;140,000, is estimated to be of the order of &euro;185m and &euro;220m for the first year and for a full year respectively. </p><p>Regarding Question 21400/19, the estimated yield from tapering out the personal, PAYE and Earned Income credits by 2% per &euro;1,000 on individual income between &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 per year, resulting in no entitlement to these tax credits when income is in excess of &euro;150,000, is estimated to be of the order of &euro;170m and &euro;205m for the first year and for a full year respectively. </p><p>Regarding Question 21401/19, the estimated yield from tapering out the personal, PAYE and Earned Income credits by 5% per &euro;1,000 on individual income between &euro;100,000 and &euro;120,000 per year, resulting in no entitlement to these tax credits when income is in excess of &euro;120,000, is estimated to be of the order of &euro;220m and &euro;265m for the first year and for a full year respectively. </p><p>Regarding Question 21402/19, the estimated yield from tapering out the personal, PAYE and Earned Income credits by 5% per &euro;1,000 on individual income between &euro;100,000 and &euro;120,000 per year, resulting in no entitlement to these tax credits when income is in excess of &euro;120,000, coupled with an additional USC rate of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7% on income in excess of &euro;120,000 is set out in the following table:<table><tr><th></th><th>First Year &euro;m</th><th>Full Year &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Tapering &amp;amp;

They therefore should be treated with caution.</p><p>Further, as the Deputy will already be aware, the estimates in relation to the tapering of credits are based on tax returns for 2016 following a bespoke exercise undertaken to break down the gross incomes of taxpayer units to an individualised level and a manual estimation process (outside of Revenue&rsquo;s usual tax modelling software).  As that exercise can only split gross incomes, this estimation process required a number of assumptions to be made in relation to the distribution of credits.</p><p>In relation to those questions which contain changes to the Universal Social Charge, these figures for the USC are from the Revenue micro-simulation model, Tax Modeller, and are estimates for 2019. Therefore the figures provided in these Questions are a mixture of 2019 estimates and 2016 estimates. </p><p>Finally it should be noted that, while these costings are provided where possible based on estimated individual incomes, the tax system and the Revenue IT infrastructure used to assess tax liabilities remain configured on a taxpayer unit basis. There would be significant development work (and associated cost and time) required to implement any changes to this basis. Were such a change implemented, it may lead to outcomes different to those modelled at present using the estimated data.</p></reply>

NARPS operates by purchasing suitable properties for social housing from NAMA debtors and borrowers and then leasing onwards these properties to Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, who then forward lease them on to individuals on social housing lists to occupy.</p>  <p>  Any suggestion that NARPS or its underlying units are now being sold by NAMA is incorrect. There is no sales process underway or planned for a sale of the vehicle at this time.</p>  <p>  NAMA is now approaching the wind down phase of its operations, and active consideration of its end-of-life strategy is underway. These considerations will be examined as part of my forthcoming Section 227 Review of NAMA.

Officials in my Department are in discussions with NAMA as how to best utilise NARPS to protect is social housing mandate post-2021 and I will make a final decision on how to best achieve this goal as part of the Section 227 Review process.</p></reply>

The Code of Practice is for guidance only and the employment status of an individual in relation to an engagement may in some instances fall to be determined by the Courts. </p>  <p>  Where an individual is an employee, his or her salary or wages is chargeable to income tax under Schedule E and is subject to deductions under the PAYE system by his or her employer.  The employer is obliged to pay a PRSI contribution for employees under the PAYE system.  This employer contribution is paid for employees whose employment is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts. </p>  <p>  Where an employee is employed by an individual solely on domestic duties, including childminding, in the employer&rsquo;s home and is paid less than &euro;40 per week, and the employer concerned has only one such employee, then, the domestic employer is not required to register as an employer for the purposes of the operation of the PAYE system of deductions.  However, the employer is obliged to pay employer&rsquo;s PRSI.  The PRSI liability is payable by the employer in a single sum at the end of the tax year to the Special Collection Section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce a specific income tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs but the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children. </p>  <p>  In recognition of these cost pressures, there are already a number of support measures in place to ease the burden on working parents.  These include various tax-exempted child-care related supports provided by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and measures such as the Working Family Payment provided by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  With regard to taxation measures, the Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Childcare Services was introduced to encourage employers to develop childcare facilities onsite for their employees.  Also, there is tax relief for individuals who provide child-minding services in their own home, provided that they do not receive more than &euro;15,000 income per annum from the child-minding income.   </p></reply>

The Central Bank is examining this practice to determine if it is permissible under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code 2012, and other regulations. </p></reply>

Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  Much work has been done to date through the implementation of both reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and achievements to date include:</p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries;</p>  <p>  - the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has commenced its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;</p>  <p>  - increasing transparency around the cost of private motor insurance through the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank;</p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;</p>  <p>  - amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; </p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, collections of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system; as well as the launch recently of Operation Coatee, a co-ordinated operation to tackle insurance fraud; and,</p>  <p>  - the Courts Service has confirmed that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports.   </p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from April 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.4% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses and voluntary groups.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  Both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy believe that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and we are working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and voluntary groups and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  Much work has been done in implementing both reports and achievements to date include: </p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries;</p>  <p>  - the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has commenced its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;</p>  <p>  - increasing transparency around the cost of private motor insurance through the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank;</p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;</p>  <p>  - amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; </p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, collections of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system; as well as the launch recently of Operation Coatee, a co-ordinated operation to tackle insurance fraud; and,</p>  <p>  - the Courts Service has confirmed that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports.   </p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from April 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.4% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  Both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy believe that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and we are working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

Therefore, the data Revenue holds on properties liable to LPT makes no distinction between those that are occupied or vacant and does not provide information on which to estimate the possible yield from the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal.</p>  <p>  Regarding Question 21617/19, I am informed by Revenue that LPT returns require owners to indicate whether their properties are principal or non-principal primary residences (NPPR). However, the information does not distinguish whether NPPR properties are owned by commercial landlords or otherwise. Page 25 of the Revenue Ready Reckoner, available at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/ready-reckoner.pdf, shows the yield that could be generated from imposing an additional flat charge on all NPPRs (Local Authority and Approved Housing Body owned properties are not included as NPPRs). While the calculation does not show the specific costing requested by the Deputy, the yield from a &euro;100 per property charge is shown, and the yield from a &euro;400 charge can be estimated on a pro-rata or straight-line basis.</p></reply>

Given that individuals join trade unions largely for the well-known benefits of membership, and the potential value of the relief to an individual would equate to just over &euro;1 per week, this scheme would have little to no incentive effect on the numbers choosing to join.

I am advised by the TAC that it is difficult to provide an actual quantum figure because the original quantum of tax under appeal may be modified post filing of the notice of appeal (i.e. where an aspect of the appeal is settled or withdrawn), the parties may disagree in relation to the precise quantum of tax in dispute, or the monetary value of an appeal is not always calculable (e.g. in appeals where the rate of tax is in dispute or where the quantum in dispute represents a refusal of loss relief or of deductions or in appeals in relation to the refusal of Tax Clearance Certificates).  Subject to these caveats, as at 30 April, 2019 the TAC recorded the quantum of tax under appeal amounting to approximately &euro;3.7 billion. Of this amount, &euro;2.5 billion is comprised in 10 appeals, five of which were received by the TAC in the last week of December 2018.</p>  <p>  Some appeals before the TAC cannot be progressed when the Commission has to await the outcome of court proceedings.  For example, a stay may have been placed on the progression of the appeals by the TAC by Order of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court. Of the 10 highest-value appeals before the TAC, two appeals with a combined value of &euro;1.67 billion are currently stayed by Court Order and cannot be progressed by the TAC until the stays are lifted.</p>  <p>  In  view of the growing backlog of appeals, I commissioned an independent review of the workload and operations of the TAC in 2018.  In line with the review's recommendations, I sanctioned the doubling of the TAC&rsquo;s annual budget in 2019, to allow for additional staffing resources at all levels and additional funding for improved ICT systems. In June 2018 the TAC moved to a new, larger premises that allow for the scheduling of simultaneous hearings, to ensure greater and more efficient use of Commissioner&rsquo;s time. This is resulting in a reduction in the time parties have to wait for their appeal to be heard. </p>  <p>  In addition, a Public Appointments Service competition for the recruitment of Temporary Appeal Commissioners was completed recently and appointments from the resulting panel are expected shortly. Legislation is also in progress to create the role of Chairperson of the TAC, as per a recommendation of the independent review.</p>  <p>  With the substantial increase in resources at the TAC, I expect the overall number of appeals and the quantum of tax under appeal with the TAC to begin to decrease steadily over the coming year. </p></reply>

The credit is granted at a rate of 32% of the lowest of:</p>  <p>  - eligible expenditure</p>  <p>  - 80% of the total cost of production of the film</p>  <p>  - &euro;70,000,000.</p>  <p>  The minimum amount that must be spent on the production is &euro;250,000 and the minimum eligible expenditure amount to qualify is &euro;125,000.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.  There is no requirement for production companies to hire Irish actors in order to qualify for the section 481 tax credit.  However, as noted above, the credit is available only in respect of eligible expenditure which, in broad terms, encompasses payments for goods, services, and facilities in Ireland, including the employment of individuals by the producer company on the production of the film.  Such employments include the film crew, in addition to actors. </p>  <p>  A number of significant changes were made to the credit as part of 2018 Finance Bill process. In recognition of the nature of the production cycle and the long lead in times needed for productions to be undertaken, the credit was extended from its original end date of 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2024. Additionally, it was legislated to require production companies to apply for payment of the tax credit under the self-assessment system. Finance Bill 2018 also provided for a new short-term, tapered regional uplift, commencing at 5%, for productions being made in areas designated under the State aid regional guidelines.  The regional uplift was introduced subject to State aid approval and the notification process is currently under way.</p>  <p>  The application process has also been divided between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. This provides an opportunity for earlier engagement on the training requirements associated with the credit, including the quality of training to be provided.</p></reply>

Thus, the insurance company obtains a very complete picture of the individual&rsquo;s state of health which would include physical and mental health.  Each application is considered individually and the decision on whether to offer cover and on what terms depends on the facts of that particular case.  In cases where an individual applies for cover and is turned down, or is offered cover at an increased premium (or subject to special conditions), then he/she can request that the insurer's Chief Medical Officer write to his/her doctor to explain the reason for the underwriting decision.  They also state that the process of underwriting life insurance policies seeks to identify and assess all aspects of an individual&rsquo;s physical and mental health which may be relevant to the cover being applied in order to ensure that the underwriting decision is a fair one to the individual in question.</p></reply>

As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. </p>  <p>  However, in 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)). The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. </p>  <p>  During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS. The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation. The research paper, available on the ESRI website, presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland. A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios). In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined. </p>  <p>  The wealth tax scenarios in the research paper that are closest to the wealth taxes outlined by the Deputy in his questions are the high threshold-large exemptions scenario (which best matches the scenario set out in PQ 21934/19), and the high threshold-no exemptions scenarios (which best matches the scenario outlined in PQ 21932/19) in Table 5 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study. </p>  <p>  The first of these scenarios (high threshold-large exemption) has a personal threshold of &euro;1.0 million (doubled if married and a &euro;500,000 increase per child), applies a 1% tax rate and excludes farms, the household main residence, business and pension assets. This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;53 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study. The research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioral response to the tax is modeled. The estimate of &euro;53 million, therefore, is likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised. </p>  <p>  The second scenario (high threshold-no exemption), applies a 1% tax rate but allows for no exclusions. This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;248 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance/ESRI study. Again, the research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioral response to the tax is modeled. The estimate of &euro;248 million, therefore, is also likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised.  </p>  <p>  Given that the above scenarios are not identical to those outlined in the Deputy's questions, care should be taken in interpreting the revenue estimates. </p>  <p>  In order to estimate the yield from a tax with the precise parameters as outlined in the Deputy's questions, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose. This would be a significant undertaking that would take considerable time and resources to complete. It is also noted that the HFCS does not include specific data on the global assets for those domiciled or ordinarily resident and the domestic assets for those resident for tax purposes. As such, any estimate on the yield obtained from HFCS data would not fully capture the parameters outlined in the Deputy's question.</p>  <p>  However, there are a number of additional scenarios set out in the paper which the Deputy may find informative.</p></reply>

The framework for REITs is designed to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment through a corporate vehicle. The property rental income and gains are exempt from tax within the REIT, they are taxed instead at the investor level when distributed. Part 25A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&ldquo;TCA 1997&rdquo;) requires that 85% of all property income profits are distributed annually to investors. Any income or gains arising to the REIT which is not in respect of the REITs property rental business is subject to corporation tax. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that information in respect of potential future capital gains from the sale of property held by REITs is unavailable.

Non-resident REIT shareholders resident in treaty countries may be able to reclaim part of this dividend withholding tax if the relevant treaty allows. Given this interaction with tax treaties and that information is not available in relation to potential future REIT dividends to investors an accurate estimate of any potential revenue from an increase in the withholding tax rate cannot be made.</p></reply>

The regime provides that the profits arising to an Irish fund from Irish property remain within the charge to Irish tax. An IREF is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of the assets is derived from real estate assets in the State. Generally, where a unit holder receives value from the IREF an IREF withholding tax of 20% will apply.</p>  <p>  On introduction in Finance Act 2016 the IREF regime provided for an exemption from IREF withholding tax on the distribution of profits that arose from holding Irish land or buildings for more than 5 years.

The available information is the amounts of capital allowances claimed in respect of intangible assets. </p>  <p>  The 80% cap on capital allowances was re-introduced in Finance Bill 2017 and it applies to all intangible assets acquired from 11 October 2017. It is important to note that the imposition of a cap on capital allowances for intangible assets only affects the timing of relief in the form of capital allowances and related interest expenses for intangible assets but does not affect the overall quantum of relief.  This is because any amounts restricted in one accounting period as a result of a cap are available for carry forward and utilisation in a subsequent accounting period, subject to the application of the cap in that period. Therefore no additional tax revenue would be raised in the long-term through the Deputy's proposal. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, based on levels of capital allowance claims in tax returns for recent years, it is tentatively estimated that there would be a cash flow benefit of approximately &euro;750 million if intangible assets acquired between 2015 and 11 October 2017 were subject to the 80% cap. It is important to be clear that such a change would not lead to more tax overall and this simply a timing matter - to present this as additional tax for the exchequer would not be correct. I do not wish to repeat the mistakes of the past by increasing expenditure through unsustainable tax changes. I would also note that this estimate is on the basis of assuming no behavioural change on the part of the companies involved. Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, changes to tax law are generally made on a prospective basis such that they apply only from the date on which they have legal effect. </p></reply>

Loss relief for corporation tax is a long standing feature of the Irish Corporate Tax system and is a standard feature of Corporation Tax systems in all OECD countries. </p>  <p>  Section 396C of the TCA 1997 previously restricted NAMA participating institutions to offset losses against a maximum of 50% of taxable profits in a given year. At the time of its introduction the Government had limited involvement in the banking system. However, by Finance Bill 2013, this measure was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose. Due to the substantial holdings that the State had, by that time, acquired in the banking sector (99.8% AIB and 15% of Bank of Ireland), the restriction was deemed to be acting against the State&rsquo;s interests.</p>  <p>  Section 396C was repealed to reduce the State&rsquo;s role as a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; provider of capital and to protect the existing value of the State&rsquo;s equity and debt investments. With the removal of Section 396C, AIB and BOI were restored to the same position as other Irish corporates, including other Irish banks.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to quantify the estimated additional corporation tax revenue from the measures referred to by the Deputy, as this would depend on the future profitability of the banks. Nevertheless, as I have previously stated, I do not intend to change how losses are currently treated for Irish banks, including those that were bailed out by the State, as I believe there could be consequences that would make it difficult for me to fulfill other objectives in respect of the Irish banking system.  Such a change could have knock on implications for the cost of lending and deposits for consumers and businesses in Ireland.  There would also be a material negative impact on the valuation of the State's investments from any change in tax treatment of accumulated losses where the banks are concerned. </p>  <p>  It is important to understand that the State is actually getting value today from these deferred tax assets through our share sales.  The banks are also contributing to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy, introduced in 2013, which generates an annual yield of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In 2018 my officials produced a report for the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the potential consequences of changes to the tax treatment of losses carried forward for banks.  This report, which contains further information and more detailed consideration of the points set out above, is published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This roadmap takes stock of the changing international tax environment, outlines the actions Ireland has taken to date and the further actions that will be taken over the coming years to ensure that our corporation tax code is line with international best practices.  It outlines the various commitments we have made to tackle global tax avoidance, including those made in respect of the 15 actions of the OECD BEPS Action Plan but it also includes details in relation to the transposition of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (&lsquo;ATAD&rsquo;), which comprise measures that directly correspond to specific BEPS actions.</p>  <p>  The Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting, a tool developed by the OECD in accordance with Action 13, and the Knowledge Development Box which is in line with BEPS Action 5 were introduced in Finance Act 2015.  Ireland is also fully compliant with the exchange of information on cross border tax rulings requirements in line with BEPS Action 5.</p>  <p>  The commitments set out in the roadmap regarding the remaining BEPS actions included commitments with regard to legislation to be introduced in Finance Act 2018.   Finance Act 2018 introduced controlled foreign company (&lsquo;CFC&rsquo;) rules (BEPS Action 3) with effect from 1 January 2019. The purpose of CFC rules is to discourage the artificial diversion of income to low tax jurisdictions. As such they are not designed primarily to raise Exchequer revenue, but rather to modify taxpayer behaviour.</p>  <p>  The final legislative steps required to allow Ireland to complete the ratification of the BEPS multilateral instrument (BEPS Actions 6, 7, and 15 and certain aspects of BEPS Actions 2 and 14) were also taken in Finance Act 2018. The changes introduced to the application of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaties are primarily anti-avoidance in nature and are aimed at stopping international tax planning strategies known as treaty shopping. It is not possible to estimate the potential impact on the Exchequer from the changes that will be made to the application of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaties.</p>  <p>  The Corporation Tax Roadmap also enumerates further commitments to action over the next two years, including the introduction of anti-hybrid and anti-reverse hybrid rules (BEPS Action 2); an interest limitation ratio (BEPS Action 4); updating of transfer pricing rules (Actions 8-10); further work on mandatory disclosure rules (BEPS Action 12) and dispute resolution (BEPS Action 14).  It will not be possible to estimate the impact on the Exchequer of such measures, were they implemented by the end of 2019, until the process of designing the measures is significantly further advanced. </p>  <p>  No specific direct tax measures have been recommended to date in addressing the tax challenges associated with the digital economy (BEPS Action 1). Work continues at OECD and EU level in relation to this.  As a result, it is not possible to estimate the impact on the Exchequer of BEPS Action 1.</p>  <p>  BEPS Action 11 focuses on data collection and analysis. It does not make any specific recommendations in relation to tax changes. It relates to measurement of BEPS and suggests improvements in data collection. Therefore, it is not a revenue raising action and as a result, it is not possible to estimate the budgetary impact of BEPS Action 11.</p>  <p>  As I outlined in the roadmap, the confluence of the OECD BEPS outcomes and the most significant US tax reform in recent history is likely to lead to significant changes in the structure of multinationals over the next number of years. The purpose of the programme of changes set out in the Roadmap is to ensure that Ireland remains on a sustainable path for growth and investment in this rapidly-changing international tax environment.</p></reply>

The levy is intended to raise a fixed annual yield of &euro;150M.  In relation to the years 2017 and 2018, a rate of 59% was required to yield &euro;150M based on the financial institutions&rsquo; DIRT liability for the base year 2015.  The year 2017 will be used as the base year to determine the levy for the years 2019 and 2020.  As there has been a substantial fall in DIRT payable by financial institutions since 2015 the rate will have to be increased from 59% to maintain the &euro;150M yield.</p>  <p>  I recently announced that I intend to bring forward a Financial Resolution on Budget night 2019 increasing the rate of the levy from 59% to 170%, which, when applied to the DIRT payable in 2017, will continue to yield &euro;150M. </p>  <p>  Without an increase in the current rate of 59% the levy would yield &euro;52.2M in 2019.  Increasing the current rate by 10% would  bring the rate to 65%  which would yield approximately &euro;5.2M in additional revenue. An increase of 10 percentage points from 59% to 69% would yield approximately &euro;8.8M in additional revenue. </p></reply>

What this translates to in monetary terms will be determined by the resources required by the Bank to discharge its legal responsibilities during a given year. </p><p>In 2017, the full cost of financial regulation activities amounted to &euro;184.9 million (2017: &euro;155.0 million) funded by income of &euro;107.9 million (2017: &euro;77.8 million) and subvention of &euro;76.9 million (2017: &euro;77.3 million). </p><p>If industry was fully charged, there would be no subvention, however, there are certain costs (e.g. markets supervision) which it may be appropriate to continue to subvent on an ongoing basis where the costs cannot be attributed to specific firms but do relate to the orderly function of markets and the financial stability agenda.  </p><p>My officials are liaising with the Central Bank in pursuing a strategy of moving towards full industry funding where appropriate. Further information on timeframes and implications for each industry category will be published in the coming weeks with the release of 2018 Annual Report and Annual Performance Statement.  </p><p>The 2018 financial statements will also show a reduction in subvention year on year attributable to increases in recovery rates in the 2018 billing cycle.</p><p>Further information on the Industry Funding Levy is available on the Central Bank's website as follows: </p><p><i>centralbank.ie/regulation/how-we-regulate/fees-levies/industry-funding-levy/guidance</i>.</p></reply>

Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits in pension schemes are not generally required to be supplied to Revenue. Therefore, there is no readily available underlying data or methodology on which to base reliable estimates of any possible yield which might be realised from the reductions in the Standard Fund Threshold outlined by the Deputy.</p><p>Regarding Question 21954/19, I am advised by Revenue that as there is no requirement to include data in tax returns in relation to tax free lumps of less than &euro;200,000 (the current life-time limit on tax-free retirement lump sums), it is not possible to quantify reliably the estimated yield for the Exchequer from the reductions of the tax free lump sum entitlement set out by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Within the remit of the Central Bank&rsquo;s responsibilities, the approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework while ensuring banks are sufficiently capitalised, hold appropriately conservative provisions, and have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations.</p><p>Since the Central Bank first introduced the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) in 2009, there have been 23 inspections specifically to test compliance with the CCMA. However, this is just one aspect of our supervisory approach to protecting borrowers in arrears.</p><p><b>2010 Themed Inspection of CCMA</b></p><p>In 2010, the Central Bank undertook a themed inspection across five mortgage lenders to ensure the CCMA had been implemented and was being complied with. </p><p><b>2011 Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies</b></p><p>In late 2011, the Central Bank further intensified its engagement with lenders with regard to mortgage arrears resolution. To press banks to remediate these shortcomings and ensure appropriate board-level focus, in October 2011, mortgage lenders were required to submit to the Central Bank board-reviewed and approved mortgage arrears resolution strategies (MARS). The purpose was to ensure the fair treatment of borrowers, supported by detailed implementation plans to deal with their stock of arrears cases as well as new inflows.</p><p><b>2011 Themed Inspection of CCMA</b></p><p>In 2011, the Central Bank published the findings of a themed inspection of six mortgage lenders which examined compliance with the requirements of the revised CCMA specifically relating to charges on mortgage accounts in arrears.</p><p><b>2012 Operational Capability Assessments</b></p><p>The introduction of the CCMA in 2009 set out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre arrears.  </p><p>One additional provision of the CCMA in 2011 mandated lenders to establish a centralised arrears support unit (ASU), which must be adequately staffed, to manage cases under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  The focus in early 2012 centred on further examining and challenging banks&rsquo; operational capacity to resolve NPLs, and pressing banks to remediate shortfalls identified during their MARS assessments.  Blackrock Solutions was commissioned to undertake an independent Distressed Credit Operations Review (DCOR) focusing on residential mortgage and SME distress management. </p><p>During the latter part of 2012 and throughout 2013, the Central Bank continued to challenge banks regarding their operational capabilities and undertook a number of different inspection related activities to review banks ASUs to assess if meaningful progress was being made in their approach to resolving distressed loans. While progress was being made, gaps were identified particularly in the 2012 and early 2013 inspections.</p><p><b>2013 Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets</b></p><p>In early 2013, the Central Bank introduced the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) framework. Through MART, the Central Bank imposed quarterly quantitative targets on the six main mortgage lenders (accounting for approximately 90 per cent of the Irish mortgage market) on Republic of Ireland principal dwelling home/primary residence and buy-to-let mortgage portfolios. The targets were focused on resolving arrears greater than 90 days.  </p><p>The Central Bank also introduced enhanced supervisory reporting requirements to monitor and challenge progress by banks in implementing sustainable solutions. On-site credit inspections by the Central Bank examined samples of these sustainable solutions during the MART programme.</p><p><b>2015 Themed Inspection of the CCMA</b></p><p>In 2015, the Central Bank published the outcome of a themed inspection of seven lenders&rsquo; compliance with the CCMA. </p><p>Formal supervisory requirements, with specific timelines for remediation, were imposed on those lenders where the Central Bank identified risks to borrowers. </p><p>No firm has been sanctioned for a breach of the CCMA to date.</p><p><b>2018 Inspections of the CCMA</b></p><p>In 2018, the Central Bank undertook five inspections in relation to the CCMA including some that contributed to the review into the effectiveness of the CCMA (Section 6(a) Report).</p><p>In addition, the Central Bank has also conducted and published research on consumers&rsquo; experience of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process. Consumer explainers and guides on the CCMA, have also been published by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

Kildare and the Annes Grove Miniature Castle at Annes Grove Gardens, Castletownroche, Co. Cork.  </p>  <p>  While the OPW may dispose of properties that are surplus to State requirements on the open market, lodges like those in the Phoenix Park are considered intrinsic to the historic estates, parks and gardens in the care of the OPW and are not disposed.  Therefore, in general, these are retained in the ownership of the State.</p></reply>

It stipulates that every spending proposal should be appraised carefully but the resources spent on appraisal should be commensurate with the cost of the projects or expenditure proposals. Projects over &euro;5 million should be subjected to an economic appraisal.  </p><p>It is currently being reviewed as part of the ongoing reform of Ireland&rsquo;s capital management systems to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus in improved appraisal, cost estimation and management. The revised central elements of the Public Spending Code relating to the appraisal and management of public capital projects will be published before the summer.  Further technical guidance building upon these central elements will follow in the second half of 2019 and in 2020. </p><p>Costs are stated in different ways for public projects depending on the stage the project is at in its lifecycle. </p><p>The Public Spending Code sets out the requirements for business cases for public projects including: </p><p>- setting out project objectives and scope, </p><p>- identifying and costing feasible options,</p><p>- analysing a narrowed list of viable options using financial and sensitivity analysis and, for projects over &euro;5 million, economic analysis,</p><p>- setting out a risk strategy outlining key risks and potential mitigation measures,</p><p>- setting out a plan for project delivery,</p><p>- setting out a plan for how the project will be monitored and evaluated; and</p><p>- making a recommendation as to the delivery option which will achieve the desired outcome and which would represent value for money.</p><p>Within the business case, the financial analysis looks at the project cashflows over the economically useful life of the project to inform affordability. The cashflows should include all costs such as operating, capital, labour, tax, charges, etc. VAT is included in the financial analysis cashflows.</p><p>While the financial analysis assesses affordability, the economic appraisal assesses the economic and social value of the project. A number of adjustments are made to the financial analysis cashflow figures to arrive at the figures used in the economic analysis. The adjustments include reflecting the deadweight loss associated with taxation used to raise public funds and removing transfer payments such as VAT. VAT is not included in the economic costs of the project.</p><p>In recognition of the different VAT levels that are applied in different jurisdictions across the EU, the thresholds that determine the applicability of the EU procurement directives are stated as VAT exclusive. When tendering public contracts the same principle is usually applied.</p></reply>

The rates are based on a methodology which takes account of both overhead costs (such as car purchase costs, depreciation and insurance) and also running costs (fuel costs and maintenance). The rates are intended to reimburse an officer for the costs incurred and are not considered to be a source of emolument or profit. As such, these rates are not considered to be an incentive for officers to use their own cars for official travel.</p>  <p>  All-electric vehicles, including both cars and electric bicycles, are a relatively new and developing technology. Comprehensive information such as that available for petrol/diesel driven cars is not yet available for electric vehicles and, as a consequence, it has not yet possible to devise a mileage rate for electric cars and bicycles in the same manner as for petrol/diesel vehicles. The current policy of my Department is that civil servants using all-electric vehicles may claim reimbursement at the lowest mileage rate (0 &ndash; 1200 CC) which currently stands at 37.95 cent per kilometre. This policy will be kept under review and will be adjusted as appropriate as the situation with electric vehicles becomes clearer.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Revenue Commissioners administer a tax relief scheme for employers to provide a bicycle to employees where the employee does not incur a tax cost for benefit in kind. The Cycle to Work Scheme operates by way of a salary sacrifice and may also be used towards the cost of an electric bike. Where an officer uses their own bicycle for official travel, they may claim mileage at a rate of 8 cent per kilometre. This rate has been in place since 2007 and was determined by reference to annual wear and tear, the average cost of a bicycle, depreciation, maintenance, cleaning and repairs, and protective clothing.</p></reply>

In this regard, the contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005. The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;</p><p>This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.</p><p>The contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector (link below) specifically requires that SNAs are required to work the month of June on examinations and work appropriate to the grade including training. This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005. This condition of service places a clear onus and obligation on the SNA to attend at their place of work and be available for work during the month of June.</p><p>It is a matter for school management as their employer to determine the precise work that is to be completed by SNAs during the month of June. The utilisation of this period is not specifically for examinations or training purposes only, although these are two of the purposes for which the period of work can be utilised. </p><p>Link to the SNA Contract of Employment for the Post Primary sector:</p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary) </p><p>This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs. These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time.</p></reply>

It provides for schools, for the purposes of facilitating the efficient admission of students, to share information with each other in respect of applications received, offers made and offers accepted.

In 2019, over &euro;1.87 billion will be invested in Special Education, nearly one fifth of the overall Education budget, and up 49% since 2011.</p><p>Seventy-five schools, both primary and post-primary, in Kildare, Wicklow and South Dublin have been invited to participate in this new package of education and health supports to be piloted and evaluated in the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>One key feature of the School Inclusion Model is the establishment of an enhanced Regional Support Team for schools in the pilot, under the auspices of the National Council for Special Education, which will include behaviour practitioners. This team will complement other services working with schools.</p><p>Behaviour practitioners will be experts who understand the emotional and development needs of children and young people. They will work with schools and teachers in the pilot area at both whole school level through the provision of professional development, workshops and seminars and with individual teachers in the classroom where the focus will be on practice.</p></reply>

This draft overview will be the focus of further public consultation in Autumn 2019. The development of the overview involves exploring key aspects of a primary curriculum through:</p>  <p>  - Working with schools and settings</p>  <p>  -  Learning from research</p>  <p>  - A series of invitational seminars</p>  <p>  Members of the public will be invited to contribute to the consultation process and provide their views as to what areas of learning should be included in a future primary curriculum to meet the needs of Irish pupils.</p></reply>

Of these, there are 3 ASD early intervention classes, 26 primary ASD classes and 9 post primary ASD classes in the areas referred to by the Deputy.  </p><p>The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 197 in 2018/2019. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie. </p><p>When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  </p><p>Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p><p>In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Education Needs Base (SEN Base) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools.</p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment issues remain.  There are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to shortages in capacity in the school system.  </p><p>The NCSE formally advised me that there is insufficient special school and special class capacity in Dublin 15 and in Kildare. </p><p>This letter is the formal activation of section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018).  This contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available.</p><p>The NCSE and my Department are actively engaging with education service providers in order to encourage them to address the shortage of places.  </p><p>I am encouraged that to date these efforts have resolved the issue in Kildare and resulted in progress in Dublin 15.</p><p>Engagement with schools, patrons bodies, parents and others is continuing in Dublin 15 to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream.</p><p>The NCSE will keep in regular contact with the Parents of the children concerned to advise them of progress and identify placements as they become available.</p><p>The NCSE and my Department officials hosted a briefing session for Oireachtas members in Leinster House on Tuesday last to advise members on the approach being taken.</p><p>The new power to compel schools to make additional special education provision available has yet to be invoked.  </p><p>While the NCSE and the Department continue to encourage stakeholders to open special classes, the process under the admissions legislation will continue and may lead to interaction with education providers entering a more formal process. </p><p>In short, ensuring that every child has a suitable placement available to them from September is a key priority for this Government.  </p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS ceased making payments to IoTs and apprentices pay the full pro rata ASC.</p>  <p>  The amount charged to apprentices undertaking both craft and new consortia led apprenticeships is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in Institutes of Technology (IoTs) during the academic year.  These arrangements mean that apprentices are treated the same, on a pro rata basis for the proportion of a full academic year they spend in IoTs, as full time students in terms of the ASC.  For craft apprenticeships, the cost would typically be one third of the &euro;3,000 ASC paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the IoT.  In the case of the new consortia led apprenticeships the contribution varies for each programme as their off-the-job training has a more flexible structure.  In cases where training is delivered in an Education and Training Board there is no contribution made by the apprentice.  Further detail on these charges is available on the website apprenticeship.ie.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, unlike full time students, apprentices in the craft trades are paid a training allowance by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in IoTs.  Apprentices in the new consortia led apprenticeships are paid by their employer for phases of their training spent in IoTs.</p></reply>

The main provisions of the Regulation include the establishment of a Competent Authority to issue removal and referral orders and oversee compliance with these orders, to monitor proactive measures which are being undertaken by industry and to search for and identify terrorist content online. Clearly, this important proposal will create significant obligations for both Member States and service providers. </p>  <p>  Following on from the Government&rsquo;s strong support for the Christchurch Call, last week I hosted a meeting with representatives of the technology industry in Ireland to discuss tackling illegal content online and how the commitments contained in the Christchurch Call might be put into practical action.  This discussion also focused on the implementation of the proposed EU Regulation, as well as on the existing structures and processes to report and remove illegal content, how they can be improved, how Government and industry can work closer together to address illegal content and a future framework for tackling this type of material.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, action is also taking place on a national level to tackle illegal content online through the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-2019 which contains twenty-five actions under five main goals.  This is very much a whole of Government approach and actions are assigned to six Government Departments for implementation, including my own.</p></reply>

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received.  The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.  Where a decision is made, the certificate cannot be issued until the applicant attends a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose of swearing the oath of allegiance before a judge.  </p>  <p>  Processing timescales can often be impacted due to further documentation being required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee being awaited, or the applicant not engaging with the office.  In some instances, the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application, for example, where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.  In other instances issues can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered before a final decision is taken. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process and thus an average wait time for applications is not a meaningful measure.  However, I can say that in general, it takes around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made.  These processing timescales are being maintained notwithstanding an increase in application numbers over the past year.  </p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that the naturalisation application process is a complex one which requires a considerable amount of supporting documentation but this is necessarily the case given the honour of being granted Irish citizenship and the significant benefits attendant to securing an Irish passport, particularly in the context of visa free travel to other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the wide ranging Transformation Programme currently under way in my Department. The INIS Service Improvement Plan 2018-2020 dovetails with this programme and commits the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department to significant investment in technological developments including the roll-out of online forms and payments for citizenship applications as well as streamlining of processes and procedures.  Such developments are expected to deliver significant improvements to customer experiences.  </p>  <p>  INIS devotes a considerable amount of its overall resources to the processing of these cases.  It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants to enable queries to be dealt with, including the progress of their application.  Details are available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie</p></reply>

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business are matters for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that the President of the High Court keeps waiting times under ongoing review.  The Courts Service works with the President and the judiciary to improve waiting times and where specific issues are identified, resources are targeted at areas of greatest need. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that asylum cases require a two stage process which include applications for leave to take a judicial review, and then the hearing of the substantive Judicial Review.  </p>  <p>  I understand there are no waiting times for applications for leave to take a judicial review as the Asylum Judicial Review List saw a number of initiatives implemented in 2018 which led to the elimination of waiting times for those applications.  Moreover, the number of active cases in the substantive Asylum List reduced from 772 to 122 through case management and other measures.  Waiting times for judicial review hearings are currently one Legal Term, indicating a case ready for hearing will be heard in the next legal term. </p>  <p>  It should be noted however that there are over 400 other cases awaiting decisions of the appellate courts or, in respect of the largest portion of that number, the Court of Justice of the European Union, before they can be progressed through the High Court.</p></reply>

These Regulations provide that all applicants must have a proven proficiency in two languages; one of which must be Irish or English. This requirement applies without discrimination to all candidates.  Such competency may be proven by achieving the relevant grades in an Irish Leaving Certificate or for English or Irish through such assessments as set out by the Public Appointments Service.  While two languages are required, applicants who do not possess proficiency in Irish but have a second language will be deemed eligible under the Regulations. </p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of the Garda Commissioner, manages the initial recruitment stages for selection of Garda Trainees and I, as Minister, have no direct involvement in the matter.  I have, however, been informed that PAS, which conducts tests as part of the competitive selection process, carefully considers all requests for reasonable accommodations.  In considering such requests, PAS is conscious of the rights of people with disabilities and of the obligations on it to observe those rights and to act in accordance with the provisions of the relevant equality legislation. </p>  <p>  As a public body established under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004, PAS is also obliged under section 34(1)(b) of that Act to ensure that &ldquo;standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness&rdquo; apply to all of its recruitment and selection work.  These binding standards are set out in the Code of Practice for Appointment to Positions where the Garda Commissioner has Statutory Responsibility, as published by the Commission for Public Service Appointments.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that in considering requests for reasonable accommodations, PAS has a fundamental duty to ensure it is being fair to all candidates who have entered a particular competition and that the key principle of appointment on merit is being observed.  To assist PAS in considering a request for accommodations in a fair and balanced way, its policy is to ask candidates to indicate on their application if they require special accommodations and to submit evidence in support of their request.  PAS will consider letters or reports from relevant professionals which clearly indicate the nature of the disability and the type of accommodation(s) that may be relevant to the person.  PAS has given additional time to people with dyslexia where they have supporting evidence.  However, having made reasonable accommodations, candidates must reach the required standard in order to be considered for further progression in a competition. </p>  <p>  In December 2018 the Government endorsed the key recommendations contained within the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and published &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo; &ndash; the implementation plan for the Commission&rsquo;s report, this includes the recommendations in relation to the reform of recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to increase the diversity of the organisation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will agree that it is vital that the Commissioner continues to recruit candidates with the appropriate qualifications to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that best practice continues to be followed with regard to any such recruitment.  I welcome and support the Commissioner&rsquo;s commitment to increasing the diversity of the members and staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to reflect the twenty first century Ireland it serves.  This will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains its strong bond with the diverse communities it serves.  The recommendations of the Commission will take time to implement, and any proposal to amend the Recruitment and Admission regulations, including the language requirement will require consideration and consultation with a number of interested parties.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.</p>  <p>   I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda vetting applications regarding the person referred to by the Deputy were received on 22 May and 10 December 2018 by the National Vetting Bureau. </p>  <p>   At present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the Vetting Bureau in five working days.  However, in a number of instances it is necessary to conduct further enquiries with external agencies.  Enquiries with external agencies are conducted for a multiplicity of reasons such as verification of identity, updating of incomplete records and establishing other matters.  In such instances processing times are significantly longer than the general average.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that on processing the applications of the person referred to by the Deputy, it was established that it was necessary to conduct further enquiries.  These enquiries are still ongoing and unfortunately it is not possible to issue a Garda vetting disclosure at this stage. </p>  <p>  Any inconvenience arising from a delay is regretted, but I am sure you can fully appreciate, applications cannot be finalised at by the Vetting Bureau until all enquiries are concluded.</p></reply>

In addition to that programme, other major works to the Garda estate which are ongoing include the pilot Garda station reopening project, the development of a new facility at Military Road and the major refurbishment of Fitzgibbon Street station.  The clear goal of this investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff, as well as the public interacting with them.    </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Office of Public Works has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  As such, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works (OPW). </p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to 2 stations in particular, namely Kill O'Grange and Cabinteely.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that under the Garda Station Rationalisation Programme of 2012 and 2013, 139 Garda Stations were closed nationwide.  Kill O&rsquo;Grange Garda station, DMR East, was closed and handed back to the Office of Public Works on 27 April 2013.  Cabinteely remains an operational Garda station.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations.  Indeed the Deputy may recall that as recently as December 2018, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in its report &ldquo;Policing with Local Communities&rdquo; confirmed that it is appropriate that the Commissioner should continue to hold this responsibility.</p>  <p>  Overall Garda accommodation needs, including any potential need for a new station at any location, fall to be considered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of the ongoing expansion of the Garda workforce and in the context of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Cohort Model of resource allocation is currently utilised for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College.  The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel using the Cohort Model is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, and operational strategies.  When considering the allocation of resources to a Division, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all factors are taken into consideration.</p><p>In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it is important to keep in mind that they have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that while not all Garda Stations are training stations, the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p><p>The information in relation to the number of new recruits allocated to each Garda Station is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the link below, as supplied by the Commissioner.</p><p><i>http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/08_Allocation_of_Probationer_Garda&iacute;_by_Division_and_Station_2014_to_March_2019</i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the link below:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

The review is an important priority for me and for my Department. I expect a draft report with options for reform to be submitted to me in the coming weeks. The review has undergone some delay, due to other urgent legislative priorities and also due to important judgments from the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights in the intervening period since the announcement of the review. These judgments will be taken into account in the review. </p>  <p>  The Review is addressing several issues that have been raised in submissions to the Review, including questions relating to the level of damages which has been raised by the print media in recent campaigns in this field. Specifically, the review will address, among other issues:  </p>  <p>  - Whether changes should be made to the respective roles of the judge and the jury in High Court defamation cases, in particular in relation to the question of damages;</p>  <p>  - Whether any change should be made to the level or type of damages which may be awarded in defamation cases, or to the factors to be taken into account in making that determination.</p>  <p>  The core aim of defamation law in general is to find the right balance between protecting an individual&rsquo;s good name and privacy, and protecting the right to freedom of expression, taking account of the vital role in our democracy played by a free and independent press. It is important that the Defamation Act operates in practice to ensure that damages awarded to a plaintiff are fair and proportionate to the harm suffered by them in the context of a defamatory statement. </p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to the so called &ldquo;serious harm&rdquo; test which was introduced in section 1 of the Defamation Act 2013 in England and Wales. Since the enactment of the 2013 Act in England and Wales, this test requires a claimant when initiating a defamation action to prove that a potentially defamatory statement has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant before the case can proceed. The effects of this requirement on defamation law in England and Wales and its possible effects in the Irish context are being considered as part of the review. This is only one of several options being examined at the moment to determine which reforms would be most effective and appropriate in the Irish legal context. </p></reply>

The applicants original passport will be returned to them in the coming days.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited. </p></reply>

That is why my Department has put in place a range of supports to help businesses prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. The Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that businesses around the country can manage risks and avail of any opportunities. This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m. This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.</p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs], up 22% on 2018, which have a presence in every county, to support start-ups and growth and, in particular, to support businesses to prepare for Brexit. The LEOs will work with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This includes a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.</p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence and find new markets. This new Scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. I announced the first 11 successful applicants on Friday 01 March last and there will be a further call for proposals this year. In addition, Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018.</p><p>Funding to InterTradeIreland has been increased by 18% and they, along with the LEOs, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland.</p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme opened for eligibility applications on Wednesday 17 April and it will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million.</p><p>The first table attached sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019 and the cost/expenditure of the supports available. Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p><p>The second table attached sets out the uptake of the different Brexit-related supports available through the Department and its agencies as at 20 May 2019.

Instead, IDA site visit data is collated on a county-by-county basis. In the first quarter of 2019 there were three site visits to County Kildare. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the Agency's efforts to attract more investment to Kildare will be assisted by the County's strong profile as a home to overseas firms in the technology, financial services and pharmaceuticals sectors. IDA client companies such as Intel, Pfizer, and Procter and Gamble are all located there and continue to perform well. Kildare has seen a 4.5% increase in foreign direct investment-driven employment over the last 12 months with 386 net new jobs added. </p>  <p>  While clear progress has been made in creating new jobs and economic opportunities in Kildare, the Government is determined to achieve more.

In this regard I am committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient, day case and outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  The Scheduled Care Access Plan is a key pillar of the project plan to deliver on the Ministerial and Department&rsquo;s 2019 Priority to improve Acute Hospital Waiting Times. The governance and oversight structures to oversee NTPF and HSE performance in the delivery against the targets set out in the Plan has been expanded to include a Working Group whose remit is to develop initiatives aimed at improving access for patients to scheduled care in a number of high volume specialities including Ophthalmology.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, I wish to inform the Deputy that the LTI Scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;124 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.</p>  <p>  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services over the past number of years. Since this Government took up office, the budget for Disability Services has increased by &euro;314 million. This year alone, the Health Service Executive has allocated &euro;1.9 billion to its Disability Services Programme.</p>  <p>  My primary concern is to ensure the continuity of appropriate person-centred disability services is maintained and delivered in an equitable manner consistent with the care and support needs of individuals. I want to acknowledge the important services provided by Rehab and the commitment of the staff of Rehab to people with a disability and their families.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the HSE that the total revenue allocation provided by the HSE to Rehab for social services has increased by &euro;8.1 million to &euro;56.1 million in 2019 when compared with the allocation in 2016.</p>  <p>  Rehab provides a range of services to young people and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities, mental health difficulties, autism, or acquired brain injury. Services are co-ordinated through Rehab&rsquo;s three service delivery divisions, RehabCare, the National Learning Network and Rehab Enterprises.</p>  <p>  Rehab and the HSE have committed to working intensively together with a view to making substantive progress in reaching a solution to the issues. </p>  <p>  Rehab have agreed not to issue a notice of termination, pending the conclusion of this intensive work with the HSE. Both I and Minister Harris have committed to a further meeting with Rehab and the HSE today.</p></reply>

It increased by 119 whole time equivalents or 4% in the year to the end of March 2019. In the five years to the end of March 2019 the number of consultants has increased by 529 - over 20% - and now stands at 3,110 WTE's. </p>  <p>  However, the public health service in Ireland operates in a global market for medical specialists where there is a world-wide shortage of specialists. There are significant recruitment challenges, particularly in filing posts in certain specialties and locations. Many of these vacancies are filled on a locum or agency basis to support service delivery.</p>  <p>  The issue has been examined by the Public Sector Pay Commission in relation to consultants.  The Commission found that evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications was indicative of on-going difficulties in regard to recruitment of consultants.  The Commission also acknowledged that the difference in pay between the pre-existing and new entrant consultants is greater than for other categories of public servants. Ultimately, the Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address this difficulty.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to current vacancy rates.</p></reply>

An AHD is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future when he or she no longer has capacity. </p>  <p>  Section 91 of the Act relates to the development of a code of practice to accompany the AHD provisions. On 17 October 2016 I established a multidisciplinary working group to prepare a detailed series of recommendations for the Director of the Decision Support Service (DSS), in relation to the code of practice under section 91(2) of the Act. In anticipation of the completion of that process, I commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 [S.I. No. 527 of 2018]. This will enable the Director of the DSS to progress the preparation of the code of practice on the AHD provisions, based on the working group&rsquo;s recommendations, and in accordance with the specific process outlined in the Act. The multidisciplinary working group submitted its recommendations on the code of practice to the Director of the DSS on 21 December 2018.</p>  <p>  Once completed the final code of practice can be published by the Director with my consent.</p>  <p>  The development of the code of practice to accompany the AHD provisions is a key piece of work in facilitating the subsequent commencement of Part 8 in its entirety.</p></reply>

The CervicalCheck programme has agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. In addition, agreement has been reached with the laboratory with the largest backlog to process tests based on a HPV initial testing model; i.e. HPV testing will be carried out on samples prior to cytology. I am advised that this approach was chosen as the most effective way to process all outstanding tests based on prioritising women most at risk.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. It has said that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to him.</p></reply>

Indeed it must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this.</p>  <p>  The OPAP policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. A new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) was established in October 2017 and a progress report on each recommendation in the OPAP is currently being finalised under the aegis of the OPIOG. It is expected that this progress report will be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In relation to the annual bulletin or scorecard to evaluate the progress made with implementing the OPAP, my Department has requested the Health Research Board Centre for Diet and Research at University College Cork to develop a framework for this.  It is expected that this framework will be finalised before the summer, which will then allow for a qualitative and robust assessment of progress with implementing the OPAP to be compiled and published later in the year, and on an annual basis thereafter.</p></reply>

The HSE Winter Plan sought to ensure that the health system was as prepared as possible for the increase in demand on services over the winter months, within existing capacity and financial parameters.</p><p>The HSE are currently undertaking a review of performance across all Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations (CHO&rsquo;s) over the winter period. The review will consider planning, implementation and performance at Group and CHO level.</p><p>The existing HSE review of winter 2018/2019 will be extended to include an Expert Review and Analysis of ED activity and relative performance of sites. In this context, the HSE&rsquo;s initial focus will be on the 9 individual focus sites and their relevant CHOs as well as comparative performance with a number of other sites that performed well in 2018/2019.</p><p>Nationally, between January and March 2019, the number of patients recorded as waiting on trolleys in acute hospitals nationally at 8am was 28,962, a decrease of 4,050 (12.3%) compared to the same period in 2018 (33,012).</p><p>The HSE's provisional figures show 9,708 people were recorded on trolleys in the month of April which was 0.8% lower than March (9,789) of this year.</p><p>It is important to put the trolley figures in context. The hospital system is currently operating at close to full capacity. The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year, with approximately 1.3 million attendances in 2018, up 3.5% on 2017. This reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 and over age group. </p><p>The Health Service Capacity Review published last year was crystal clear on the need for a major investment in additional capacity in both hospital and community &ndash; combined with a wide scale reform of the manner and the location of where health services are provided.</p><p>As set out in Sl&aacute;intecare, moving care options for patients closer to their homes and into their local communities is a key part of the solution.</p><p>Increasing capacity is a priority for Government. An additional 241 acute hospital beds opened under the Winter Initiative 2017/2018, and the National Service Plan for 2019 provides for a comprehensive capacity programme. A capacity programme for 2019 has been agreed, which provides for the following increases in capacity:</p><p>- 78 additional beds, including a 40-bed modular build in South Tipperary General Hospital, and a 30-bed ward in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda;</p><p>- 75 acute beds and 70 community beds as part of the Winter Plan;</p><p>- preparation of 202 beds by quarter 4 2019 with a view to bringing this extra capacity into operation in the first quarter of 2020;</p><p>- preparation of the proposed opening of a 60-bed modular build in University Hospital Limerick.</p><p>The number of available inpatient beds is expected to increase to above 11,000 following the investment planned in the National Service Plan 2019.</p></reply>

UHL was identified as one of the 9 sites requiring additional investment, focus and support as part of this year's Winter Plan. The problem of overcrowding in hospitals requires a full system, patient focused response. Recognising this, in the Winter Plan, the HSE sought to maximise the use of existing resources across hospital groups and CHOs and to target additional investment at both hospital and community services and supports. </p><p>Increasing capacity is a priority for the Government. Since 2017, an additional 25 beds have opened in UHL, including 8 as part of this year's Winter Plan.</p><p>The Capacity Programme for 2019 provides for the following increases to capacity, as set out in the National Service Plan 2019:</p><p>- 78 additional beds, including a 40-bed modular build in South Tipperary General Hospital, and a 30-bed ward in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda;</p><p>- 75 acute beds and 70 community beds as part of the Winter Plan, of which 60 acute beds and 19 community beds have already opened;</p><p>- preparation of 202 beds by quarter 4 2019 with a view to bringing this extra capacity into operation in the first quarter of 2020;</p><p>- preparation of the proposed opening of a 60-bed modular build in University Hospital Limerick.</p><p>Funding has been provided in the National Service Plan 2019 to facilitate the opening of the modular build at South Tipperary General Hospital.

This includes the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register (the &ldquo;Register&rdquo;), the purpose of which is to vindicate the rights of a donor-conceived child to access information on their genetic heritage. This is based on the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child concerning the right of a child to an identity and internationally regarded as best practice. However, as the Register will contain personal and potentially sensitive information about the various parties to a DAHR procedure, and particularly about the children born as a result of the procedures, robust data protection measures must be put in place prior to the establishment of the Register. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act also requires consent forms relating to the parties to a DAHR procedure (donors and intending parents) to be prescribed by regulations. The Department of Health is liaising with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in relation to the drafting of those regulations.</p>  <p>  As you will no doubt be aware a technical amendment was required to section 27 (5) of the Act in order to ensure that a certificate can be issued in the context of all donor assisted human reproduction procedures performed under Part 2 of the Act. This amendment was included in the Civil Registration Bill 2019, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. This Bill passed Report Stage in the Seanad this week.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to commence Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 before the summer recess.</p></reply>

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p><p>1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p><p>2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p><p>This report was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. Preparation of the report involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report was informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years.</p><p>The report was informed by the personal experiences and concerns of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery, including through written representations to me and my Department, those concerns raised in Parliamentary Questions on this subject, and the issues raised by the Mesh Survivors Ireland group at its meeting with me on 14 June 2018. I acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown by the women I met and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were often harrowing, deeply personal experiences.</p><p>The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p><p>The Report makes 19 recommendations including:</p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials;</p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;</p><p>- the development of clinical guidance;</p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;</p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and</p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.</p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. </p><p>The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented.</p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.  The Group includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. </p><p>I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through this Group. This work includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE is also examining the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.</p><p>The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website.</p><p>As was requested by the Secretary General of my Department in November 2018, the HSE has prepared an Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, which was approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website on 26 April 2019, which I hope provides further clarity on this issue.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE has advised that a detailed progress report on implementation of the recommendations will be provided to my Department by 30 June 2019.</p><p>At my recent meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS  and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

Deer appear to be a localised issue in many areas.  In this context, there is a significant challenge in attempting to ensure that the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation coexist and that deer populations are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.</p><p>In 2015 my Department, together with the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht, published Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are abundant. Key elements from this report, in particular training and awareness in relation to Deer management issues in agriculture are now being carried out by the Wicklow Deer management project and within the forestry sector. This work is ongoing.</p><p>Adoption of best practice is fully supported by both Departments and the majority of deer management stakeholders. Best practice guidance, adapted to Irish conditions was published with the assistance of the Irish Deer Management Forum during 2018 and can be accessed via <i>www.idmf.ie</i>.</p><p>A number of initiatives have been carried out in Co. Wicklow for example with a view to defining locally-led approaches to cooperative deer management. My Department is currently supporting a project led by the Wicklow Deer Management Partnership and Wicklow Uplands Forum, aimed at improving cooperation between landowners and local hunters. This project builds on previous experience in Wicklow through projects such as the Ballinastoe Deer Management Project, the Calary Deer Steering Group and the Calary/North&ndash;East Wicklow Deer TB survey. These projects provide a good example for other local groups to follow, in areas affected by deer-related issues.</p><p>My Department also introduced a Deer Fencing and Tree Shelter Scheme to protect forests from predation by deer in 2018 as deer can cause serious damage to trees, particularly in native woodlands. Additionally, my Department has also engaged with the Society of Irish Foresters, Teagasc and Third Level Institutes in the delivery of deer management training to professional Foresters and Contractors through a series of seminars and field training events. This work is ongoing.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agri-food and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year for farm incomes in 2018 due to weather conditions.  There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The announcement last week by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is really welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission.</p>  <p>  The announcement by the Commissioner is another example of the importance of EU solidarity when it comes to facing significant economic challenges.</p>  <p>  Details of the proposal are being discussed with the Commission and I will make information available to farmers as soon as possible. The legal provisions used to provide the aid (Council Regulation 1308/2013) were put in place by the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2013. It is expected that this decision will be given effect through an Implementing Regulation. My officials will examine its provisions, when published, and engage with the Commission on the next steps.</p></reply>

The review was undertaken with the assistance of Teagasc and international experts. Current support schemes were reviewed to ensure the continued relevance of DAFM&rsquo;s response and value for money for both the taxpayer and the individual owners, and to ensure that the forest owner is provided with a broader range of silvicultural and management options.

BEEP targets the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves - measuring the live weight of the calf pre-weaning as a percentage of the cow's live weight. BEEP had been announced in Budget 2019 as part of the &euro;78 m Brexit package for the agri-food industry. As well as clear environmental and climate benefits, BEEP will provide additional farm income at a time of market volatility and uncertainty relating to Brexit.</p>  <p>  Some 18,883 farmers from all across the country had registered their interest in participating in the Pilot by the closing date of February 22 and they will qualify for payment provided they comply with the requirements to weigh each cow and calf and provide the requisite data to ICBF in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. The &euro;20 million funding available will allow for payment of up to a maximum of &euro;40 per calf.</p>  <p>  ICBF has been registering privately owned scales and accepting weight records from participating beef farmers since the 8th of March. Over 2,000 individuals have registered privately owned scales to date and over 40,000 weights have already been recorded.  Last week, I welcomed the start of the roll-out of rental scales to over 70 ICOS-affiliated livestock marts and co-ops across the country.  This will see some 400 sets of scales being made available to rent from these locations allowing those farmers that do not have access to privately owned scales to record eligible cow and calf weights to meet their requirements under the Pilot.</p>  <p>  The roll-out of rental scales is in conjunction with the earlier release of smartphone applications for both Android and Apple devices to facilitate the quick and accurate submission of weight records.</p>  <p>  Weights may be submitted online, by smartphone application or on a paper form available from ICBF.</p></reply>

The value is then calculated taking all of this information into account as well as information collected from the market place by my Department and any relevant compensation ceilings as per the terms of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The OFMV aims to ensure, through the principles of independent assessment, taking into account up to date market data from across the country, that herdowners receive an accurate market value for their TB reactors at the time of breakdown.  In line with these principles, depreciation levels applied to purebred registered Bulls valued under the OFMV scheme are currently being reviewed on the basis of information from the market.</p></reply>

I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to beef farmers under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.</p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. Building on this is the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million pilot project for 2019. There is no scope for the introduction of a &euro;200 suckler payment under the current RDP.</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP, and through the next Agri Food strategy to 2030. My view is that such measures should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.</p></reply>

A farmer wishing to consider an appeal initially submits an Appeals Notification Form to DAFM. </p><p>b. DAFM responds to this form, providing the farmer with the appropriate data underlying the status of the townland in question.  This information will allow the farmer in question to make a fully informed appeal at this stage should he/she wish to do so. </p><p>c. If a farmer follows up with a full appeal via DAFM, a full file will be prepared by DAFM in respect of each case.  This file will include copies of all documentation. </p><p>d. Appeals Committee meetings may be convened to consider a batch of cases together in a comprehensive manner.  It is expected that each batch of appeals may take a number of weeks to complete. </p><p>e. In certain circumstances, the Committee may request additional information (including a ground investigation) from DAFM. </p><p>f. Having considered all relevant information, a recommendation will be made in respect of each case/townland in a fair manner by collective decision of the Committee. </p><p>9) Following this process, the Committee will make a recommendation in writing to DAFM on each case. </p><p>10) DAFM shall be the final decision maker in all cases where the Committee has made a recommendation. </p><p>11)  Following the completion of an appeal, the right of referral to the Office of the Ombudsman remains with the appellant.</p></reply>

A robust traceability system will support our continued efforts to gain new export markets for Irish sheep meat.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the current national sheep identification system is widely acknowledged to be very complex, with an over reliance on the manual transcription of individual sheep identification numbers, leading to errors in the recording of information that is essential in tracing an animal back to the holding of its origin. </p>  <p>  The extension of electronic identification will simplify the sheep tagging system by significantly reducing the record keeping requirements for sheep farmers moving sheep to livestock marts and slaughter plants operating as approved Central Points of Recording (CPRs).  This will provide a more accurate and robust sheep traceability system in support of animal health and public health objectives and thus support the further development and sustainability of the sheep industry.</p>  <p>  My officials are working very closely with marts and slaughter plants to ensure that as many of these premises as possible will operate as CPRs with effect from 1st June.  It is my understanding that the major sheep processing slaughter plants are making significant progress in this regard.  Marts are similarly well disposed to operating as CPRs and are proactively engaging with the CPR process with a view to having facilities in place at the earliest opportunity.  I accept that the upgrading of mart facilities to CPR standards will be an incremental process and, on the basis of their proactive engagement, I anticipate that a significant number of marts will be in a position to operate as CPRs in a relatively short period. </p>  <p>  Keepers moving sheep to approved CPRs will continue to be required to fill out a dispatch document to accompany the sheep on movement but will not be required to list the individual numbers of each sheep consigned to a specific batch. All that will be required of them in that regard is to record, in the relevant part of the dispatch document, the total number of sheep associated with that document.  The CPR will scan all presented sheep and will provide the keeper (and purchaser where appropriate) with a printed list of all presented tag numbers (LPT).  The serial number of the corresponding dispatch document will be printed on the LPT also to facilitate the keeper in associating this list with his/her copy of the dispatch document.  It is important that this LPT is checked by the keeper for accuracy.  This document and the copy of the dispatch document must be kept by the keeper for record keeping purposes.</p>  <p>  Where it is not feasible for marts or slaughter plants to upgrade their facilities to CPR requirements, farmers can continue to move sheep to these premises by either scanning and printing out the tag numbers of the sheep to be moved for attachment to the relevant dispatch document or by continuing to record the individual number of each sheep presented to a non-CPR mart or slaughter plant on the dispatch document.</p>  <p>  The extension of EID to all sheep will further enhance traceability across the sheep sector and will assist in the Government's efforts to maintain and expand the export markets for Irish sheep meat.  Indeed, I was very pleased to announce during my trade mission to China just last week that the Chinese authorities have agreed to an inspection visit on sheep meat in Ireland in August this year.

I believe that such schemes can provide a positive economic opportunity for producers and for rural areas.  An application can be submitted by, or on behalf of, a group of producers.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department organised a workshop on Geographical Indications, with participation by the EU Commission and a range of stakeholders, at which the possibility of applying for a PGI for Irish beef was explored. </p>  <p>  PGI status requires products to be produced in accordance with a particular technical specification and producers are required to meet that specification to ensure production meets the quality standards set. </p>  <p>  Where there are large numbers of producers it can be a significant undertaking, requiring a disciplined and harmonised approach to production and its verification.  Nevertheless, there can be significant marketing advantages and there was very positive feedback from participants at the workshop.  My officials are currently examining the key elements required in such an application, in consultation with stakeholders. </p>  <p>  An application can only be submitted by, or on behalf of, a group of producers.  A formal national consultation period is also required.</p></reply>

However responsibility for instream works may also be a matter for a number of statutory authorities depending on the nature of the development proposed.  I am advised that where a river forms part of a drainage district, but is not within a drainage scheme, then responsibility for maintenance of that river falls on the Local Authority(ies) in whose area the river is situate as specified in the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fishery waters are included in or are adjacent to Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).  I understand that development, in or within 15 kilometres of, an SAC requires screening for Appropriate Assessment under the EU Habitats Directive and this necessitates consultation by the project promoter with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the National Parks and Wildlife Service from whom consent is likely to be required.  Such Appropriate Assessments often result in a requirement for planning permission which involves the relevant Local Authority.</p>  <p>  IFI provides grant aid for fisheries related work which is available to angling clubs, community groups and Local Authorities and is subject, like all public funding schemes, to all statutory conditions being met and relevant statutory permissions obtained. </p>  <p>  Without specific details of the issue being raised by the Deputy it is not possible for me to advise further.  If the Deputy has a particular issue in mind I would be happy to ask IFI to liaise with him directly.</p></reply>

The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 premises each year thereafter until roll out is completed.  The ultimate take-up of the service is estimated to be around 80%. This will be driven by linking payment of subsidy to verification of connections made by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) as well as passing premises in the Intervention Area.  There are also requirements in the contract around demand stimulation and stakeholder engagement to drive take up. </p>  <p>  The nearest comparison in relation to take up is the eir 300k rural deployment. Take up of this service is in line with the trajectory anticipated by eir when it planned the rural fibre rollout.  The rate of take up along eir's 300k deployment has increased throughout 2018 and is expected to increase further as eir proceeds to pass and connect further premises every month and as awareness of the availability of high speed broadband improves and retailers offer a choice and variety of communications packages over the network.  There is nothing to suggest that demand in the intervention area would differ from the demand for high speed broadband in urban areas, or in the eir 300k deployment area. </p>  <p>  In addition, the bidder was required to develop and analyse the demand for their service.  This included profiling of demographics, surveys and benchmarking exercises.  The bidder carried out a market analysis of the end-users in the intervention area as well as a benchmarking analysis for the demand for a high speed broadband service by those likely end-users.  This analysis supported forecasted demand for take-up which was included in the final tender submission. </p>  <p>  The level of subsidy is capped and NBI bears all risk beyond that provided for within the subsidy allowed, for example the cost of materials, labour and any lower than expected take up.</p></reply>

Both analyses concluded that the costs to acquire eir would likely exceed the subsidy to be awarded under the current proposed solution to the NBP State intervention. Similar to the other long list of alternatives considered, my Department concluded that to pursue this area would further delay the NBP and take longer to reach 100% of the premises in the Intervention Area.

A CBA Benefits report and a detailed benefits calculation annex were published in 2015. This CBA was updated over the last four years and the finalised CBA was published earlier this month.</p>  <p>  Alternative options for delivering high speed broadband were also considered in the context of only one bidder remaining in the process and this analysis has also been published. Each of these alternatives were considered against the CBA framework.</p>  <p>  In stress testing a number of alternative options, it is not expected that a full CBA be carried out, rather it was to evaluate the salient changes that other options would bring, and evaluate them in the context of the general framework of benefits and costs. Some options sought to reduce the area covered, to alter the technology, to delay the roll out, or to alter the model underpinning the tender. This all involved an examination of costs, potential changes, state aid requirements etc.</p>  <p>  That analysis concluded that these alternatives would take longer to reach 100% of the premises in the Intervention Area and in some scenarios would involve leaving some premises behind. In addition, the analysis concluded that the alternatives considered could potentially result in a higher cost to the State, would require a consultation on a new strategy, along with a new procurement process and State aid application. Some of the alternatives considered were unlikely to provide the level of future proofing required under the European Commission's Strategy for a Gigabit Society. </p></reply>

Member States have a wide margin of discretion in designing interventions to support broadband roll-out and choosing an appropriate intervention and financing model, subject to notification under State aid rules as appropriate.  The measure proposed by Ireland to address the market failure identified was consulted on in 2015 and decided prior to the initiation of the public procurement process in December 2015. The Commission has made it clear to my Department that should Ireland wish to pursue an alternative investment model (for example a new State agency) to that chosen in 2015, a complete (pre-) notification to the EU Commission would be necessary, outlining in detail the design of the intervention under any new investment model and its possible compatibility with all relevant State aid rules (including the relevant Procurement Law Directive), with the same level of detail as has been provided under the current plan. </p>  <p>  To establish a new non- commercial state agency my Department estimates that a new process would take at least 2 years from initiation to the appointment of an Agency, given the complexity of ensuring Ireland remains compliant with broadband State Aid and procurement law requirements. Such an agency would have to be established from scratch. Should an agency model be chosen, that Agency would then have to set out a plan to procure the necessary network design, build and operate contractors to act on behalf of the Agency to rollout the network and offer wholesale services to the market. </p></reply>

A CBA Benefits report and a detailed benefits calculation annex was published in 2015 by my Department as part of the approval to launch the procurement process. All updates to the 2015 CBA were shared with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) and the final CBA has been published by my Department this May.  The CBA has been developed and updated over the last four years. It was only through detailed engagement with the market through the 800 hours of dialogue with all bidders and through receiving the final tender submission by Granahan McCourt, that it was possible to finalise the published CBA which remains positive, even in the pessimistic scenario. </p>  <p>  There was also significant engagement between my Department and its advisers and the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on behalf of DPER on the CBA. The development of the CBA has incorporated feedback from IGEES and DPER officials. The development of the CBA has incorporated and addressed feedback from IGEES and DPER officials to ensure compliance with the PSC. </p>  <p>  During the course of engagement with IGEES and DPER officials an issue was raised by IGEES which was based on new guidance from that unit and had not been considered as part of the 2015 CBA. When this feedback was incorporated it resulted in a reduction to the net benefits in the CBA. An issue was identified in February 2019 relating to incorrect costs being included in the CBA. This error had not been in the 2015 CBA but instead was included in later CBA iterations. Correction of this error resulted in a reduction in costs, with the number in the CBA now reflecting the Final Tender. These corrections to benefits and costs are reflected in the final CBA and resulted in an overall positive CBA, published earlier this month. </p>  <p>  There are challenges in applying the PSC to a bespoke project such as the NBP however, all of the benefits included in the CBA are consistent with the PSC Guidelines and generally accepted approached to CBAs of this nature. </p>  <p>  PwC have provided all necessary assurances to my Department that both the CBA published in 2015 and the final CBA provided to the DPER and published in 2019 are accurate for all known costs and benefits allowed for under the PSC and are fully compliant with the PSC. </p></reply>

The scheme was introduced in 2010 and requires suppliers of liquid road transport fuels to ensure that biofuels make up a portion of annual fuel sales. It works on the basis of tradable certificates - two certificates are awarded per litre of sustainable biofuel if that biofuel is produced from wastes or residues, or one certificate is awarded per litre for all other sustainable biofuels.   For each calendar year, a fuel supplier must hold sufficient biofuel obligation certificates to demonstrate compliance. Suppliers can meet their obligation either by placing sufficient amounts of biofuel on the market themselves, or by purchasing certificates from other suppliers with a surplus. The number of certificates required is determined by the biofuel obligation rate which increased in January 2019 from 8% by volume to 10% by volume. This means that at the end of the year, a fuel supplier must hold ten biofuel certificates for every 90 litres of fossil fuel they place on the road transport fuel market this year. Earlier this year, I signed an order to increase the biofuel obligation rate to 11% by volume, or 11 certificates per 89 litres of fossil fuel, from 1 January 2020.</p>  <p>  In 2018, in order to meet the obligation over 200 million litres of biofuels were placed on the road transport fuel market. I expect the 10% by volume obligation from 2019 and the 11% by volume obligation from 2020 to be met. </p></reply>

The cost of procurement projects are published, exclusive of VAT, on the eTenders website and the Official Journal of the EU in accordance with procurement rules, which are based on the principle of equal treatment.

While National Broadband Ireland will, similar to any commercial company, strive to maximise its revenue and profitability, it will be constrained due to State Aid restrictions and regulatory oversight of the prices it can charge. Under State Aid rules it cannot use the subsidised network to compete in commercial areas and therefore its annual turnover may at its peak be in the order of &euro;150m. The monthly prices it can charge are also capped to ensure they are comparable to those charged in urban areas. National Broadband Ireland will have to cover its operating costs from its annual revenues.    It is difficult, therefore, to estimate with any certainty what the value of the company is likely to be at year 25 of the contract. Where the company is profitable at this point, the State will clawback 40% of this value under the contract and NBI will continue to operate the company at its own cost and serve all customers for a further 10 years up to 2054.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 74% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband.  </p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. Following rigorous evaluation by my Department, I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May. </p>  <p>  The Government decision means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to the contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment will start as soon as the contract is signed and will take 7 years.</p>  <p>  The network to be built will provide the majority of homes and businesses with a fibre connection. A small percentage (estimated at 2% of premises in the intervention area) of remote or difficult to connect premises may be connected with alternative technology such as fixed wireless, as long as the company meets the bandwidth and performance requirements of the contract. </p></reply>

Data for electricity and gas retail price statistics are collected by Eurostat for European Union Member States including Ireland and these statistics are published regularly. These Eurostat data do not include measures of comparative electricity generation costs and have only recently started to provide indicators on the disaggregated components that make up business retail electricity prices. The SEAI publishes biannual reports on Irish retail electricity and gas price statistics, which present these Eurostat electricity and gas price statistics for Ireland and European Union Member States. The most recent such report is available on the SEAI website at the following <i>link: </i>. </p><p>The primary driver of electricity price rises over the previous two years has been the sharp increase in international gas prices, which has pushed up the cost of wholesale gas and wholesale electricity for Irish energy suppliers. Ireland is particularly exposed to volatile international gas prices, which can be the price setting fuel in Ireland&rsquo;s all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM). Indeed, natural gas accounted for 50% of Irish gross electricity generation in 2016 versus the 19% EU average. </p><p>The Government believes that competition is a critical means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices. Additionally our heavy dependence on gas in the electricity mix underlines the need to maintain the focus on the limited controllable cost factors. Among the actions being taken are to increase the penetration of indigenous secure renewables in the Irish electricity system and promote energy efficiency in businesses. </p></reply>

Following rigorous evaluation by my Department, I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May. </p>  <p>  The Government decision means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to the contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p>  <p>  In the first year of this roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. A deployment plan will be made available by the bidder once the contract is signed. The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by end of the second year of the overall deployment, with 70,000 to 100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out to the 540,000 is completed. </p>  <p>  Roll out of the National Broadband Plan State intervention to the approximately 44,000 businesses in the intervention area will take place against the backdrop of a significant and rapid transformation in the structure of global and national economies. </p>  <p>  A growing number of businesses and industries, particularly digitally intensive enterprises, will need Gigabit connectivity to create new applications and business models to produce, distribute and sell their goods and services more competitively. From manufacturing systems to ordering and delivery processes, from data storage and analytics to internal and external communications, their future competitiveness requires cost-effective access to such connectivity. The State intervention will provide this connectivity to businesses from day one of connection.</p>  <p>  One of the key elements of the NBP Intervention Strategy is a requirement to put forward specific speeds and connection times to meet the best practice needs of the business community. The predominantly fibre solution proposed by the Preferred Bidder in the NBP will facilitate and support these types of business services and the network to be built will provide that confidence and assurance to all businesses in the Intervention Area.</p>  <p>  The cost of providing high speed broadband internationally is dependent on a range of factors including the cost of labour and materials, the governance and regulatory regime in place and the preferred technology selected by operators and policy makers. It is therefore not possible to state whether the cost of broadband is increasing internationally. However, while each country may have a different approach Ireland is not alone in pursuing fibre as a solution for provision of high speed broadband in rural areas. While the procurement process did not specify a preferred technology all bidders in the process proposed fibre as the best solution. My Department considered other technologies such as 4G and 5G or fixed wireless. It agreed with the national and international expertise in this area that a fibre-based solution was the most cost-effective way to address all premises with a future proofed solution over the 25 years of the contract. This is in line with the approach being adopted in other EU countries and internationally.</p>  <p>  Fibre can meet the requirements and additional capacity can be added over time at low additional cost to network operators. Fibre can deliver up to 10 Gbps of speed with no major upgrades required, ensuring that the solution is future proofed and has a low running cost, making it an extremely efficient solution. </p></reply>

To assist in the provision of information to the public, my Department, in conjunction with the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices, launched a new website in November 2018, <i>www.mywaste.ie</i>. This website provides consumers with a single information resource on all aspects of domestic waste management in Ireland and in particular it focuses on the provision of advice on managing waste more responsibly and efficiently. In addition, I provide funding to the EPA for the National Waste Prevention Programme which supports a Local Authority Prevention Network (LAPN). The LAPN is provided with grant aid and technical support to deliver local prevention initiatives, thereby raising awareness and delivering behavioural change at local level. Many LAPN initiatives have focussed on plastic waste prevention, through working with businesses, community groups, schools, public authorities and event management companies. </p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations. The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at <i>consumerline@comreg.ie</i>and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.  </p><p>With respect to the quality of mobile telephony service in other countries, comparisons between Member States and within regions can be problematic for many reasons, including the fact that the technical characteristics of mobile phone networks that determine coverage and capacity will vary between operators and locations. Other factors would include the characteristics of individual markets, including topography, population density, frequencies used etc. </p><p>Notwithstanding ComReg's independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the coverage deficits across the country. An Implementation Group is overseeing the implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. The Implementation Group meets on a quarterly basis and publishes quarterly progress reports on the implementation status of actions. </p><p>Now in its third year of operation, the Taskforce has addressed over 60 actions and continues to focus on issues that are negatively impacting upon the rollout of essential telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas. The outcome of discussions at the second Annual National Stakeholder Forum held in October 2018 informed preparation of the 2018 Annual Review Report, which was published on 21<sup></sup>February 2019 together with the 2019 Work Programme. Over 30 new actions are contained in the 2019 Work Programme for delivery this year.</p><p>Some of the Taskforce&rsquo;s achievements to date include:</p><p>-My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p><p>-A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone black spots. It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services. </p><p>-A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure. </p><p>-ComReg has published a composite national outdoor coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them. </p><p>-ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p><p>In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p><p>All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in areas currently experiencing a low level of service. </p></reply>

In addition to helping decarbonise the energy sector by replacing fossil fuels, the production of biogas can also reduce emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors. </p>  <p>  Anaerobic digestion plants can utilise a wide variety of feedstocks ranging from food wastes, to animal slurries to specifically grown energy crops, including silage, in order to produce biogas (a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide). This biogas can be combusted in boilers to produce heat, or in combined heat and power plants to produce both heat and electricity.</p>  <p>  The REFIT3 support scheme, which is funded by the public service obligation paid by electricity consumers, has supported the development of anaerobic digestion facilities via a high-efficiency combined heat and power tariff. This scheme closed for new applications on 31 December 2015.</p>  <p>  The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat has been developed to financially support the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating and other non-domestic heat users not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. The first phase of the scheme, an installation grant for heat pumps, opened for applications in September 2018. The second phase of the scheme, an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems, was approved under State aid rules last month. The completion of the State aid approval process is a key step and I expect to be in a position to announce the opening of the second phase of the scheme in the near future. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the rollout of the SSRH for the period up to 2027. </p>  <p>  Electricity output from anaerobic digesters will also be eligible to compete for support under the forthcoming Renewable Electricity Support Scheme. The high level design of this scheme was approved by Government in July 2018 and will also require State aid approval.</p>  <p>  Biogas can also be purified by removing the carbon dioxide to produce biomethane and then injected into the gas grid. The draft National Energy and Climate Plan, published last December, includes the potential for 1.6 million MWh of biomethane grid injection by 2030. </p>  <p>  A key enabler for biomethane grid injection is the development of grid injection points. Gas Networks Ireland is currently developing Ireland's first injection point and the development of a second will be supported by the Climate Action Fund. </p>  <p>  The principal barrier to the development of biomethane grid injection is the significant cost differential between natural gas and biomethane. My Department continues to examine potential options to support biomethane grid injection including how to fund this cost differential. </p></reply>

Furthermore, 74% of managed municipal waste was recovered in 2016, compared to 59% in 2012. Significantly more residual waste is now used as a fuel (energy recovery) than disposed to landfill. Further information is available at <i></i>.</p><p>New waste management targets agreed by the European Council include a provision that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2035 the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10% or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated by weight. </p><p>The continued implementation of national and regional waste management policy to manage waste in line with the waste hierarchy will help ensure that Ireland is well placed to meet this new target.</p></reply>

In the electricity sector, this will require a major upscaling of capacity in terms of connecting renewable generation to the grid and a range of actions will be included in the forthcoming Plan. The Plan will set out how this Government intends to make Ireland climate resilient across our entire society. This will involve setting climate goals in all key sectors, including electricity, agriculture, transport and industry. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the new Framework will set out clear actions required to achieve the ambition of meeting 70% of energy demand from renewable sources by 2030. The management of connections to the electricity grid, including processes and connection charging rules, is a matter for EirGrid and ESB Networks under rules determined by the Commission for Regulation Utilities (CRU), which is an independent statutory body. It will be critical that the regulatory framework including network development, operation and delivery plans for connecting renewable energy sources are adequate to deliver on the 2030 70% RES-E ambition. </p></reply>

A lower threshold of 7 penalty points leading to disqualification applies to learner drivers and for the first two years after a driver obtains a full driving licence. Where a driver has a foreign licence a record will be created and the penalty points recorded on that record.</p>  <p>  The Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division (DVCSD) of my Department manages the computer records of all vehicles and drivers in the State, referred to collectively as the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF). This data is the definitive record in the context of motor tax collection and the issuance of driving licences, as well as enforcement initiatives and legal outcomes associated with these functions including the application of penalty points.  </p>  <p>  Having reached the penalty point threshold, the driver is notified of the disqualification by mail by the DVCSD. The driver is required to surrender his/her Irish or foreign driving licence to the National Driver Licence Service within 10 days of the disqualification commencing. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is notified weekly via a file share facility by the DVCSD of any persons who have been disqualified from driving having exceeded the specified number of penalty points relevant to their licence. The notification will also advise of the specific dates for the period of disqualification. </p>  <p>  The requirement for a disqualified driver to surrender his or her licence is set out in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 537 of 2006).  Failure to comply with the requirement to surrender the licence is an offence in itself and enforcement of the law is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  I  am aware that Garda authorities are working to improve communication so that details of specific drivers who are disqualified are readily available to the Garda on the ground and I understand that an initiative to that effect will  be rolled out under the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021. That Programme sets out a pathway so that each Garda has the technical tools that will give them direct access to all the information they need as they interact with the public on the ground.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for road improvement projects would have been considered as part of the Specific Improvement, and Strategic Regional and Local Road Grant Schemes. However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The NDP does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  </p>  <p>  Under the capital project appraisal process a Preliminary Appraisal has to be submitted in relation to each proposed project.  Once an appraisal is received it is assessed taking into account other competing projects and the overall roads budget. A draft Preliminary Appraisal has been received from Meath County Council and Department officials will be in touch with officials from the Council regarding any matters which need to be clarified following a review of that document.   At this stage of the appraisal process it is too early to say if the Department will be in a position to provide funding to advance this project.</p></reply>

This includes the effect on sectors supporting the cruise tourism industry or serving cruise visitors, not just in Dublin but in other ports and associated regions around Ireland.</p>  <p>  Through my wider stakeholder engagements, I have encouraged port and cruise industry stakeholders to take maximum advantage of other options available during the period of construction at Dublin port, when a reduced number of berths will be available for cruise calls.  While Dublin Port is important in attracting cruise liners to Ireland through Dublin, other benefits can accrue to other ports around our coast.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, Cobh continues as a dedicated cruise berth and will remain so post-Brexit.  I also welcome the fact that the Port of Cork, Dun Laoghaire Harbour and Belfast Harbour are considering how they can take some of the additional business that may be lost as a result of Dublin Port's infrastructural works. In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the development and promotion of the cruise tourism sector.</p></reply>

It is clear that this, particularly in the couple of years up to 2016, has also affected those working within the Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) industry. However, the most recent Consumer Price Index showed that the average cost of motor insurance actually fell by more than 24% between its peak in July 2016 and April 2019.</p>  <p>  Insurance companies are private companies. Neither the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered are commercial matters for insurance companies and are based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. These are considered by insurance companies on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017 and quarterly updates have been published since then to date. Based on recommendations from this report, the Advisory Committee on SPSVs met with Insurance Ireland on 22 May 2017 to discuss cost of insurance issues relating to the taxi industry and a report on the same was issued to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on 21 June 2017. This report was forwarded to the aforementioned Working Group, which is already pursuing many of the recommendations arising from the meeting, including the need for further engagement to take place between the Advisory Committee on SPSVs and Insurance Ireland. I requested that a further meeting take place but to date this has not occurred.</p>  <p>  It is my hope that this cooperation and engagement will deliver better rates for all motorists, including taxi drivers.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded  is also a matter for the local authority. </p>  <p>  As regards the Community Involvement Scheme (CIS), the Department introduced ring fenced monies for CIS as part of a pilot programme over the years 2013 to 2014. Due to overall road funding cuts it was not possible to provide ring fenced funding for CIS in the period 2015 to 2017. However in 2018 ring fenced funding was again introduced and funding of &euro;15.3m has been allocated to local authorities in 2019 for CIS. </p>  <p>  The CIS is based on community contributions within the range of 15% to 30% and the purpose of the CIS is to facilitate local community participation in the repair of local roads. The focus of the programme is on the repair of more lightly trafficked public roads which would not be high on a local authority's list of Restoration Improvement work schemes and where there is no short term prospect of undertaking repair works under that programme.  </p>  <p>  The renewed CIS programme for 2018/2019 took account of the earlier pilot study and put in place a reasonable mix in terms of public funding and community contribution (either by way of monetary contribution or through the carrying out of works). The scheme worked very well in 2018 and my Department has no plans to change the conditions of the scheme or the community contributions associated with the scheme.   It should be noted that an increase in the contribution funded from the public purse would mean that less communities would benefit from the scheme overall, as each road would require a larger share of the overall provision.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently invited local authorities to submit applications for CIS for a further two year programme in the period 2020/2021. The terms and conditions of this further funding programme are the same as the existing CIS programme. </p></reply>

They comprise local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, childcare providers and parents. There are now 30 CCCs, as Limerick City and Limerick County CCCs have amalgamated, as have Waterford City and Waterford County and North and South Tipperary. Each committee has a distinct legal identity and board of directors. </p><p>The CCCs support the delivery of the childcare programmes operated by my Department. They also perform a range of activities to promote the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) including providing information and support for parents and ECCE settings. They are also responsible for rolling out the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) training programme to pre-school practitioners nationwide. They provide support and guidance to local service providers and parents in relation to the childcare programmes and support quality in keeping with national frameworks and policy objectives. CCCs are also available to co-ordinate and provide training to providers and offer support to families with regard to Early Years services within their respective catchment areas.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the tables below. These tables outline the core funding allocated annually to each CCC from 2015 to 2019, as well as funding provided in respect of AIM and EDI, and in 2019 funding in support of nationwide training in preparation for the forthcoming National Childcare Scheme . My Department also provides additional annual funding to the CCCs to support a number of initiatives including the administration of the Childminding Development Grant, the Parent and Toddler Initiative, Learning Funding, and funding to support the work of the National Early Years Children First Committee.</p><p><b>2015</b><table><tr><th>City and   County Childcare Committees</th><th>Core

It was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  AIM is a child-centred model, involving 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending.</p><p>AIM Level 1 includes the new higher education programme in Leadership for Inclusion in the Early Years (LINC), established in 2016 with the first intake of students graduating in October 2017.  Pre-school settings employing an Inclusion Coordinator (who has graduated from LINC and has agreed to take on the role of Inclusion Coordinator (INCO) in the pre-school setting) can apply for an increase of &euro;2 per child per week in the rate of ECCE capitation payable to that setting.  Applications for this increased rate of ECCE capitation were accepted from 2017. </p><p>AIM Level 2 provides information for parents and pre-school providers.  A dedicated website has been launched under this level - www.aim.gov.ie - and an AIM Communications Strategy is also being developed.</p><p>AIM Level 3, in recognising the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children wishing to participate in the ECCE programme, provides for a multi-annual training programme for pre-school practitioners.</p><p>AIM Level 4 provides access to mentoring for pre-school practitioners from a team of dedicated AIM Early Years Specialists. </p><p>AIM Level 5 provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for early years&rsquo; settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme.</p><p>AIM Level 6 provides access to HSE therapeutic services where they are critical to enable the child to be enrolled and to meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme.</p><p>AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE programme.  In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).  Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room.  Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. </p><p>Pobal has provided the following information regarding the number of AIM applications for Levels 1, 4, 5 and 7 received by county since 2016.  As the 2018-19 programme year is not yet complete, the number of applications in relation to 2018-19 may rise further during the final weeks of the programme year.</p><p><table><tr><th>County </th><th>Level 1 - INCO   Capitation</th><th>Level 1 - INCO Capitation</th><th>Level 4 - Mentoring from Early Years Specialists</th><th>Level 4 - Mentoring from Early Years Specialists</th><th>Level 4 - Mentoring from Early Years Specialists</th><th>Level 5 - Alterations &amp;amp;

My office will follow up on this matter with the organisation in question in due course. </p>  <p>  Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the provision of care and protection to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV).  In discharging its statutory responsibility, Tusla supports 59 organisations nationally that deliver a range of services to victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.</p>  <p>  Two specific services, Donegal Women&rsquo;s Domestic Violence Service and Donegal Women&rsquo;s Centre, are funded by Tusla to provide services to domestic violence victims in County Donegal, including Inishowen.  At this time, Tusla is not seeking to commission additional services in County Donegal.</p>  <p>  A wide range of Tusla services are provided and commissioned across County Donegal, mindful of the rural nature of the county.  Accessibility is an issue for service users in many rural areas across the country, and Tusla has been supporting services in developing and enhancing outreach services in order to improve access to services.</p>  <p>  Many organisations have moved from a clinic-based response to more flexible responses, where services arrange to meet service users at times and places that are safe and convenient for them.  Tusla-funded services in County Donegal have demonstrated this approach in providing an outreach service to service users in different areas of the county, including Inishowen.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Tusla provided &euro;3,200 in funding to the organisation in question for the delivery of counselling to both adults and children.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to the development of domestic violence services.  Tusla will continue to work with service providers throughout the country to improve services for victims of domestic violence.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-21a.1546.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052100079#WREE01000"><p>Firstly may I take this opportunity to extend my condolences to the person concerned and his family on their recent bereavement. </p>  <p>  The widowed or surviving civil partner grant is a once-off payment of &euro;6000 and is available to widows, widowers or surviving civil partners who have one or more dependent children living with them at the date of death, or a widow or surviving civil partner whose child is born within 10 months of the date of death of her spouse or civil partner. The applicant must also qualify for certain Social Protection payments. </p>  <p>  The widowed or surviving civil partner grant is different in nature to many payments, including the widowed or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension, as it is a once off grant, paid at the time of a bereavement, and does not contribute to the ongoing costs of raising a child, beyond the immediate period of the bereavement. </p>  <p>  The reason a spouse does not receive a widowed or surviving civil partner grant in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy is that the person has not entered into marriage or a civil partnership with the person they were co-habiting with. Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties that do not exist in law between co-habiting couples.  </p>  <p>  The legal context governing relationships such as marriage is regulated by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Aside from the wider legal issues regarding the status of marriage and civil partnerships, which is a much broader policy area than its implications under the remit of my department, extending the current provisions to people who have not undertaken equivalent legal obligations would carry significant costs, and would also raise significant issues about criteria if it were to be based upon co-habitation. </p>  <p>  Therefore any decision to extend the qualifying criteria for the widowed or surviving civil partner grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations, as well as legal issues that may arise. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary allowance scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with bereavement expenses. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It has been designed to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives.</p>  <p>  Following the launch of the Social Housing Strategy 2020, a wide variety of developers, investors, financiers, Approved Housing Bodies and others expressed an interest in being involved in the provision or financing of social housing across the country. A structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with these bodies.  A body called the Social Housing Investment Proposals Clearing House Group - or the Clearing House Group - was established in 2015 to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved. Arising from the workings of that group, Government took the decision in February 2016 to develop a new enhanced leasing scheme, which would provide lessors with a longer-term contract with a greater proportion of market rent available, in exchange for more responsibility with regard to management and maintenance and greater risk transfer from local authorities. The Government decision at that time was informed by a consideration of indicative costs including comparative costs with other delivery schemes.</p>  <p>  In the period after February 2016, the Clearing House Group concluded its work and my Department, the National Development Finance Agency, the Housing Agency and local authorities worked to develop a new set of long-term enhanced leasing arrangements that met the requirements of that Government decision.</p>  <p>  A further set of costings were undertaken to inform the decision of Government to move forward and launch the enhanced leasing scheme in January 2018. These costings were undertaken using information on average lease costs, at that time, and the expected level of take-up of the scheme, which is targeted at 2,500 units by end 2021.  The costs of the Enhanced Lease are included in the Government's commitment to multi-annual funding to deliver on the targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland. </p>  <p>  There are a number of factors, which ensure that leasing is good value in the long term for the State. The cost of delivering social housing units under the traditional construction and acquisition model is not adequately captured by the up-front capital expenditure, as each unit will carry a stream of ongoing costs over the long-term including management, maintenance and remediation. Furthermore, during the term of the lease, the responsibility for structural matters remains with the property owner and not the local authority.  At the end of the lease term &ndash; 25 years is a substantial period - the dwelling can require major renovation or upgrading resulting in a significant capital cost, which under leasing is not borne by the local authority but by the owner. </p>  <p>  To date, there have been two Calls for Proposals, where interested parties were given the opportunity to make qualifying submissions to the scheme. The first Call for Proposals ran from 31 January 2018 and the Housing Agency accepted submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018.  After that Call for Proposals, my Department carried out a review of the submission process, to reflect on the nature of the submissions made, and amendments were made to the scheme, including the introduction of a Pre-Planning Suitability Assessment process, in order to allow proposers that have yet to obtain planning permission for their lands, an opportunity to gauge the interest of the relevant Local Authority in any proposals for housing that might come forward with planning.  Other amendments included stricter submission quality control measures, to improve the quality of the submissions.  </p>  <p>  The launch of the Second Call for Proposals, in August 2018, reflected this process review.  The scheme is the subject of ongoing monitoring by my Department, as is the case with all social housing delivery programmes. </p></reply>

As signalled in Budget 2018, the rate of the levy has been increased to 7% for sites on a local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards and in respect of which site owners will become liable to with effect from January 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively over 380 individual sites currently on the local registers. Over 120 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and are therefore subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works were activated in the interim. </p>  <p>  The specific information sought by the Deputy in relation to the amount of the levy that would be raised in particular circumstances is not available in my Department. However, based on the current legislative provisions and a recent review of the sites currently listed on local authority registers, it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally could be of the order of &euro;7.6m in 2019 (applying the current 3% levy rate) and &euro;22.7m in 2020 (applying the increased 7% levy rate). The latter estimate for 2020 is based on the number of sites currently included on the local vacant site registers and in respect of which market valuations have been attached to the registered sites. It is anticipated that the number of registered sites in respect of which market valuations will be obtained will increase in the coming months which should result in an increase in the estimated levy proceeds nationally for 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.</p></reply>

The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require that owners or occupiers take appropriate measures on derelict sites, to acquire derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and to apply a derelict sites levy on the registered owners of derelict sites. </p><p>Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. This positions members of the public to engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas.</p><p>It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas. </p><p>Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, both the Derelict Sites Levy and the Vacant Sites Levy will increase from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development while also combatting land hoarding. </p><p>In addition, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2018, which came into operation on 8 February 2018, provide for an exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of the change of use of certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant areas above ground floor premises, to residential use. This measure is aimed at facilitating the productive re-use of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply.</p><p>In relation to progress on a more general level, Rebuilding Ireland aims to deliver over 50,000 additional social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes and also aims to support some 87,000 additional households through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme, over the 6 year period of the Plan.  </p><p>Very significant progress has been made in delivering on Rebuilding Ireland's targets, with over 72,000 households having had their housing need met under the Plan by end 2018. This level of delivery has been reflected in the reductions recorded on housing waiting lists, with the number of households on waiting lists reducing by 13,941, or over 16%, between 2017 and 2018 alone.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland has been increasing the capacity of local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to deliver social housing over the past three years and clear results are being delivered.  This is evident in the fact that there was an 85% increase in new build social homes in 2018 when compared to 2017 and the number of new social housing homes built in 2018 was eight times greater than the number built in 2015, the year before Rebuilding Ireland was initiated.</p><p>My Department supports delivery through the development and implementation of policy and legislation geared towards enhanced supply and also through the provision of significant funding for local authorities. In addition, my Department works closely with each individual local authority to support them to deliver their minimum targets, and where possible to exceed their targets and advance their pipelines for additional delivery in the coming years. The quarterly Construction Status Reports which I publish provide an overview of all new build social housing completed and being advanced across the 31 local authorities.  The latest report, which sets out the position at end 2018, is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at  <i></i>.</p><p>The coming three years will see further increased output of social housing throughout the country and I have recently written to each local authority outlining ambitious targets for 2019. These targets can be viewed at</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>In 2019, record funding of &euro;2.4 billion is being provided for the delivery of housing programmes, which will allow for the housing needs of almost 27,400 additional households to be met. 10,000 of these will be provided through build, acquisition and lease programmes.</p><p>I am confident that progress remains on track to meet the target to deliver 50,000 new social housing homes over the six years 2016-2021.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

As the proposals are primarily aimed at addressing the impact on the private rental market by the use of residential homes for short term tourism type letting, in areas of high housing demand, it is intended that the new provisions will only apply in areas designated as rent pressure zones under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.</p>  <p>  Under the proposed new arrangements, homesharing will continue to be permissible for a person&rsquo;s primary residence on an unrestricted basis. In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time. Where the 90 day threshold is exceeded, change of use planning permission will be required.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, where a person owns a property that is not their principal private residence and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will also be required to apply for a change of use planning permission unless the property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. It will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, having regard to guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area concerned and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed planning reforms will come into effect on 1 July 2019 and the  primary legislative provisions required to underpin the proposals are currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas through the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018.   In this regard, section 38 of the Bill proposes to insert a new section 3A into the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the 2000 Act), to provide that the short-term letting of a house in a rent pressure zone is a material change of use of the house, thereby requiring planning permission, unless otherwise specifically exempted from this requirement.   It sets out the necessary definitions for both short-term letting and rent pressures zones. In addition, it provides me, as Minister, with specific regulation making powers that will enable planning authorities to require persons involved in short-term letting in rent pressure zones to provide specified information to their local planning authority.</p>  <p>  The primary regulations to underpin these proposals will be regulations to be made under section 4 of the 2000 Act providing for the necessary exempted development provisions, as outlined, which will shortly be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and require a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made.   As indicated, supplementary regulations to be made under the proposed new section 3A of the 2000 Act will require such persons as are specified to provide specified information to the relevant planning authority for monitoring and enforcement purposes.</p></reply>

Prior to its launch, an initial tranche of &euro;200 million of long-term fixed-rate finance was borrowed by the Housing Finance Agency to provide funds for the scheme to local authorities.</p>  <p>  When the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years. From the data collated on the scheme to date, the RIHL has proven to be more successful than initially anticipated, as a result of which, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA in order to enable its continuation.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to the amount of a second tranche, which I anticipate will be finalised soon. When these discussions are concluded I will be in a position to make an announcement on the matter. However, the scheme remains open and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications up to and including the issuing of loans. An announcement on the amount of additional funding to be provided is not inhibiting the running of the scheme in any way.</p></reply>

The <i>pyrite remediation scheme</i>is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie</i>.</p><p>The Act also sets out the broad parameters which the Board must have regard to when establishing the eligibility criteria for the pyrite remediation scheme. </p><p>The restriction in Section 15(3) of the Act preventing applications being made under the scheme by a person who purchases a dwelling on or after 12 December 2013 (the publication date of the Bill) applies where that person knew or ought to have known that the dwelling was constructed using hardcore containing reactive pyrite.  It is my Department&rsquo;s view that Section 15(3) does not represent a blanket exclusion preventing applications being made under the scheme by a person who purchases a dwelling on or after 12 December 2013. It is, however, a matter for the Board to determine, based on facts and evidence in each individual case, whether an applicant is or is not entitled to apply for inclusion into the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.</p><p>The Board has sought and received legal advice on the interpretation of Section 15, including the facts and evidence it should seek when assessing cases where a dwelling was purchased on or after 12 December 2013 and I am advised that the Board assesses each individual application as it is received, and has regard to all the facts when considering Section 15 of the Act.</p><p>The latest figures available indicate that a total of 2,351 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme. Of these, 1,905 dwellings have been included in the scheme, with the applicants notified accordingly, and 1,542 dwellings have been remediated.  A sum of &euro;32 million is available to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year.  This will facilitate the remediation of some 460 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings. This will bring to approximately &euro;126m the total funding provided under the scheme since 2014.</p></reply>
