    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-01a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100100059#WRA00800"><p>Everyone is aware that the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU will pose significant challenges for Ireland.  The challenges posed by a no-deal departure will be particularly acute.</p>  <p>  The Government has been putting in place the utmost Brexit preparations since even before the outcome of the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership became known.  Since then, Budget 2017, Budget 2018 and Budget 2019 have all contained measures to ensure that Ireland is in the best possible position to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring. </p>  <p>  These measures continue the process of assuring that Ireland&rsquo;s economy remains competitive and resilient against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty, and include balancing our books; reducing our debt burden; putting in place a major programme of capital investment; establishing the Rainy Day Fund; and broadening the tax base.</p>  <p>  Specific initiatives have been introduced aimed at supporting those sectors most affected by Brexit, most notably the Brexit Loan Scheme in Budget 2018 and the Future Growth Loan Scheme in Budget 2019.  The Future Growth Loan Scheme is open to eligible Irish enterprises, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. The Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital loans, at least 40% of which is available for food businesses.</p>  <p>  The Government and its agencies have also put in place extensive supports and advisory resources to ensure that the sectors likely to be most impacted are prepared for Brexit.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the Summer Economic Statement set out two budgetary scenarios for Budget 2020, the first involving an orderly departure by the UK from the EU and the second involving a disorderly exit.  Last month the Government decided that the budgetary strategy to be adopted should be based on the latter assumption. </p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government has already said that it will provide counter-cyclical support to the economy through social protection payments occasioned by higher unemployment and, on the revenue side, lower tax collections which help cushion aggregate demand. </p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government will also introduce timely, targeted, temporary measures. Brexit contingency support may also be needed to address specific issues in the event of a &lsquo;worst case scenario&rsquo; disorderly Brexit.  I am working with the relevant Ministers on such measures in the context of Budget 2020.</p>  <p>  All of these measures form part of a comprehensive response to Brexit across all sectors which has been set out in the Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, which was updated in July. This is the second update of the Plan that was originally published in December 2018 and reflects the extensive work that  has taken place to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s management of the economy, however, means that Ireland is facing the challenge of Brexit from a position of economic strength.  The Irish economy continues to grow at a robust pace and we are close to full employment.  But we do not underestimate the challenges ahead and will be prepared.</p></reply>

These include reducing velocities to ensure no damage to the bed of the river and associated ecosystems, and minimising impacts on the pearl mussel and crayfish populations, and adhering to EU legislation in relation to alluvial woodlands. </p><p><b></b>The project team is ensuring that any tasks that can be progressed in parallel with the above environmental assessment will be prioritised, in order to minimise any programme delays. </p><p>It is anticipated that the detailed design and preparation of the relevant documentation should be completed to allow the proposed scheme to be submitted to Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for formal Confirmation under the Arterial Drainage Act by the end of the year.  </p><p>Following Confirmation and tendering it is anticipated that the scheme should progress to construction in the second half of 2020.</p><p>Once the proposed scheme is confirmed, the OPW will contact landowners directly in order to provide information and advice prior to construction commencing. </p><p>As previously highlighted, in the interim, the following measures are in place to help alleviate the flooding problems in the town pending the delivery of the flood relief scheme:</p><p><i>- Individual Property Protection (IPP)</i>: The OPW and Mayo County Council in conjunction with the local Flood Action Group, have substantially progressed the pilot IPP project for Crossmolina, which has already installed floodgates in approximately 100 properties. </p><p><i>- Maintenance</i>: The OPW has carried out maintenance works including lowering of the berm downstream of Jack Garrett Bridge.</p><p><i>- Minor Works</i>: The OPW has also approved Mayo County Council's application for funding for a number of minor works projects in the town, and these have been put in place by the Council. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the OPW will continue to work constructively with Mayo County Council and the local Flood Action Group to take all feasible interim measures to alleviate the risk of flooding in the town.  </p><p>Crossmolina is a priority project within the OPW&rsquo;s flood investment programme and the project team are working hard to minimise further delays and to bring this much needed project to construction and completion.</p></reply>

Of this, &euro;59.3 billion is gross voted current expenditure, while &euro;7.3 billion is gross voted capital expenditure.  </p>  <p>  The effective and efficient delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and Department. In relation to spending, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on each month against expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-August 2019 was &euro;42,015 million. This is &euro;262 million, or 0.6%, below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;38,653 million, is &euro;132 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-August. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;3,362 million, is &euro;130 million, or 3.7% below profile and up &euro;683 million, or 25.5% on the same period last year. The end-September Fiscal monitor will be published later this week. </p>  <p>  At this stage in the year, it is too early to definitively state what the requirement for Supplementary Estimates will be at year-end. Expenditure Report 2020, which will be published on Budget Day, will set out an initial assessment of any necessary additional expenditure for 2019. This would take into account any policy decisions, such as relating to a Social Welfare Christmas Bonus, and any emerging expenditure pressures. While the end-August position is encouraging, there is a particular challenge in the Health sector, where the year-on-year increase to the end of August illustrates the challenge and the need for staffing and savings measures to be proactively managed by the Department of Health. There are also potential pressures in the areas of Justice and Education.</p></reply>

The main purpose of capital projects and associated investment undertaken by my Department is to support greater effectiveness and efficiency across the Civil and Public Service.  While all counties ultimately benefit from this, any capital expenditure is primarily invested in the Department's ICT systems to support and develop the ICT function across Government.</p>  <p>  More generally, my role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is to oversee the effective implementation of the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and to maintain the national frameworks such as the Public Spending Code within which Departments operate to ensure appropriate accounting for, and value for money in, public expenditure. </p>  <p>  My Department does not have a direct role in overseeing projects being progressed by other Departments.  That responsibility rests with the appropriate Minister responsible for the Sanctioning Authority who approved the project, under the policy of delegated sanction that operates in relation to capital expenditure within the capital budgets allocated to line Ministers/Departments.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Public Spending Code sets out the oversight and approval process for public expenditure proposals including capital projects. The responsibilities which lie with different roles are clearly set out in the Code. The Department or agency proposing and implementing a project is responsible for appraisal, planning, implementation, management and post project review of the project. It is known as the Sponsoring Agency. The Department or body funding the project is responsible for approval in principle following appraisal, pre-tender approval, and post tender approval if the project has significantly changed. It is known as the Sanctioning Authority.</p></reply>

These are primary areas of current expenditure that are particularly impacted by demographic pressures. These demographic projections are informed by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) paper &lsquo;<i>Budgetary Impacts of Changing Demographics 2017 &ndash; 2027</i>.&rsquo; The paper can be found on the IGEES website here: .</p><p>This paper covers a number of areas of expenditure, including pensions, child benefit, education provision and in health areas such as the acute hospitals, PCRS, community and  Nursing Home Support Scheme.

However, as part of the 2019 Spending Review process, an update of this paper is due to be published. This forthcoming paper will again look at the key areas of Health, Social Protection and Education and will examine demographic pressures in these areas over a ten year period.</p><p>More generally, introducing multi-annual funding for the totality of the Health budget would involve considerable challenges, not least in terms of establishing confidence in the soundness of the underlying financial management systems and in the ability of the Health system as a whole to plan and manage its resources on both an annual and multi-annual basis. I am hopeful that the improved leadership and governance arrangements that have recently been put in place in the Health sector, including the establishment of the HSE Board, may help to underpin confidence in such areas into the future.</p></reply>

This forthcoming paper will again look at the key areas of Health, Social Protection and Education and will examine demographic pressures in these areas over a ten year period. </p><p>More generally, introducing multi-annual funding for the totality of the Health budget would involve considerable challenges, not least in terms of establishing confidence in the soundness of the underlying financial management systems and in the ability of the Health system as a whole to plan and manage its resources on both an annual and multi-annual basis. I am hopeful that the improved leadership and governance arrangements that have recently been put in place in the Health sector, including the establishment of the HSE Board, may help to underpin confidence in such areas into the future.</p></reply>

The Departments responsible for the achievement of these targets will, over the coming months, be developing the policies and measures required to reach these targets. These policies and measures will incorporate a blend of expenditure, taxation, regulation and behavioural change initiatives that will encourage the investment decisions required across the public and private sectors, as well as by individual citizens, to achieve these targets.</p>  <p>  Much of the Exchequer investment required to support these policies and measures was already anticipated and provided for through the commitments included in the National Development Plan (NDP), which includes over &euro;30bn in investment to fund the transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society and initiatives in sustainable mobility. </p>  <p>  The Government has agreed that the cumulative Exchequer costs of the commitments included in the Climate Action Plan will be delivered within the existing multi-annual ceilings and the funding commitments made in the NDP. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, any new revenue raised from any increase in the carbon tax in 2020 will be ring-fenced and used to fund new climate action measures, including just transition.</p></reply>

The Further Revised Estimates were necessary as the Government recognised that the allocations set out in the Revised Estimates, published in December 2018, needed to be updated to reflect the materialising construction cost of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  To that end, the Government decided that in relation to the 2019 allocations an additional &euro;75 million capital expenditure allocation would be provided to the Department of Health to be met by reallocations from savings made in other sectors within the overall &euro;7.3 billion capital allocation for 2019.   </p>  <p>  As set out in the Summer Economic Statement an expenditure reserve of up to &euro;0.2 billion is to be established in 2020 to accommodate funding requirements liable to arise in connection with the National Broadband Plan and National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  No decision has been made at this time regarding the specific allocation of this reserve as the funding of additional costs in relation to these projects will be considered as part of the Budget 2020 estimates process, reflecting the most up-to-date position relating to capital spending at the time.  Beyond 2020, the Summer Economic Statement reflects the impact on the General Government Balance of additional expenditure in respect of the National Broadband Plan. </p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, I intend to provide the additional capital required to fund the National Broadband project from future revenues - this will be done in the context of updating the overall multi-annual capital ceilings set out in Project Ireland 2040.  No other projects will be delayed or rescheduled, and no other changes will be made to the capital allocations for other projects as set out in the National Development Plan as a consequence of the Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with the National Broadband Plan. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for individual projects rests with the relevant Departments.  My Department, on the other hand, is responsible for monitoring expenditure allocations at Departmental level, so I can tell him that, up to the end of August, expenditure in 2019 is being managed for both the National Broadband Plan and the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in line with the allocations set out in the Further Revised Estimates.</p></reply>

It will protect 236 properties and bring much needed relief from the worry and stress which flooding has caused to householders and businesses in the town.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the scheme is at an advanced stage of planning and design. A formal Exhibition was held in May 2019 where the public were able to review the scheme design and measures and provide feedback on what is being proposed. The scheme proposals were generally well received and the lead consultants are currently reviewing the feedback received and finalising the design and all the documentation required for submission of the scheme for formal Confirmation of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

Following Confirmation it is expected to commence construction in 2020 after tendering, with an estimated construction period of 3 years. </p>  <p>  The proposed scheme will be funded by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and I can confirm that provision for the cost of the scheme is included in the OPW's multi-annual capital framework.</p></reply>

This level of increase in voted current expenditure is significantly below that seen in the period leading up to the fiscal and economic crisis.  Over the period between the end of 2004 and 2009 gross voted current expenditure grew by 57%. </p>  <p>  A targeted approach has seen additional funding directed towards priority areas.  Gross voted current expenditure on Health, after adjusting for the disestablishment of the HSE Vote, has risen by over &euro;4 billion or over 30%.  Housing programme current expenditure has increased by almost &euro;1 billion or over 200%.   </p>  <p>  Over the last five years, in order to enhance the resilience and growth capacity of the economy, significant additional resources have been made available for capital expenditure.  Indeed, Exchequer capital investment, which represented under 7 per cent of total voted expenditure in 2014, accounts for a quarter of the overall expenditure increase in this five year period, with gross voted capital expenditure having increased by 90%.  Total capital investment of &euro;25 billion in this period has supported the delivery of economic and social infrastructure and the creation of jobs. </p>  <p>  In recent Budgets, in order to increase the resources available for spending increases tax raising measures have been introduced. Indeed, as outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, over the period 2017 to 2019, as a result of tax raising measures and the non-utilisation of the full available fiscal space for tax measures an additional &euro;1.9 billion was made available for expenditure increases over and above that originally planned in the 2016 Summer Economic Statement.</p>  <p>  In light of the current position in relation to the UK's exit from the EU, Budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit. Underlying this decision is the need to ensure the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of the Brexit challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. This strategy involves a &lsquo;twin-track&rsquo; approach of providing funding for key public services and also supporting the sectors and regions most exposed to Brexit related disruption. </p></reply>

A number of measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure and budgetary targets are being achieved on an ongoing basis. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Fiscal Monitor.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-August 2019 was &euro;42,015 million. This is &euro;262 million, or 0.6% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;38,653 million, is &euro;132 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-August. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;3,362 million, is &euro;130 million, or 3.7% below profile and up &euro;683 million, or 25.5% on the same period last year. The end-September Fiscal monitor will be published later this week.</p>  <p>  Due to the scale of Government expenditure, over &euro;66 billion in aggregate for 2019, and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons. This includes in-year policy decisions, timing issues and overspends in particular areas.</p>  <p>  Expenditure Report 2020, which will be published on Budget Day, will set out an initial assessment of any necessary additional expenditure for 2019. In relation to policy decisions this would include the decision in relation to this year&rsquo;s Social Welfare Christmas Bonus.  Looking at areas where expenditure pressures may arise, while the end-August position is encouraging, there is a particular challenge in the Health sector, where the year-on-year increase to the end of August illustrates the challenge and the need for staffing and savings measures to be proactively managed by the Department of Health. There are also potential pressures in the areas of Justice arising from pressures in relation to Asylum Seekers Accommodation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the continued uncertainty in relation to the timing of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union has required that the impacted Departments and Offices incur expenditure to ensure that we are in a position to respond to the emerging position. To the extent that offsetting underspends are not available this would necessitate certain Supplementary Estimates.</p>  <p>  The White Paper to be published this Friday will set out the aggregate forecast expenditure outturn for the year taking into account an assessment of potential Supplementary Estimate requirements.   </p></reply>

These arrangements enable them to maintain control over vulnerable sites while at the same time ensuring that a level of supervised public access is maintained for visitors.</p>  <p>  The stipend paid to keyholders and caretakers varies with the level of duties undertaken but it is fair to reflect that the amounts paid are not large and represent a token payment to these individuals who generally provide these services more out of respect and love for the Monument in their care rather than as a wage reflecting a full-time commitment.  Notwithstanding this, the OPW has been conscious that the level of payment provided for these services is low and might be reviewed.</p>  <p>  Understanding that the arrangements currently in place at sites around the country have been in force for many years and have been instituted at different times, the first step in the process, which has already been undertaken, has been to standardise payments across the portfolio and address local anomalies that have arisen in certain cases.  The next stage in the process will be to perform a review of the size of the payments with a view to adopting a broad modest increase.   I must stress that what is envisaged is not likely to result in a large increase in the stipend and certainly will not equate to a full-time wage for any individual involved who generally provide the services on an occasional / part-time basis.  OPW intends to implement any changes to rates early in 2020 once the Estimates process has concluded and available resources for various commitments have been set out in its annual Business Plan. </p></reply>

The practical effect of this is that for new entrants the relevant points on the scale will be bypassed, thereby reducing the time spent on the scale for progression to the maximum point.</font></p><p><font color="#333333">- this measure will apply from 1 March 2019 and will be applied to each new entrant as they reach the relevant scale points (point 4 and point 8) on their current increment date.</font></p><p>The cost of this measure during the remaining term of the PSSA is &euro;75 million, with the full cost of the measure based on current data and public service numbers (2017) accruing over the period out to 2026. It is estimated that some 58% (35,750) of new entrants will benefit from this measure in year 1, rising to 78% (47,750) by year 2.</p></reply>

Benchmarked against best international practice, the proposed Scheme&rsquo;s multifaceted approach takes account of the complexity of flooding in Cork which is both tidal and fluvial (river).  </p>  <p>  Flooding in 2009 and 2014 resulted in a reported &euro;140 million of damage in Cork and caused severe stress to the residents and business owners in the city.</p>  <p>  The proposed scheme will provide protection to over 900 homes and 1200 business properties in the City.  It will also facilitate significant public realm improvements in the city centre area, making it more attractive to live and work in and to visit. These improvements which include walkways and cycle ways will encourage a switch from cars to other more environmentally friendly transport modalities and should act as a catalyst for investment and development in the city.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has recently published further details and images of the proposals and it is hoped that these will assuage some misunderstanding about the Scheme and also challenge significant misrepresentation of it as well. The various public consultation phases of the project have been very helpful in informing the design of the Scheme. While the Scheme cannot deviate from the comprehensive scientific and empirical analysis on which it is based, it has taken into account many of the suggestions made during the public consultation stages. As further details and images are completed they will be put into the public domain, which will allow the public to see the overall picture of the scheme.</p></reply>

This work will continue in Budget 2020.  </p>  <p>  Given heightened uncertainty around Brexit, two budgetary scenarios were set out in the Summer Economic Statement.  The first involved an orderly exit by the UK, while the second involved a disorderly Brexit.  The Government has now decided that Budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In particular, it is envisaged that there will be a number of temporary, targeted supports for sectors of the economy hardest hit, while capital supports will be required, primarily in relation to infrastructure required at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport.</p>  <p>  Any extra borrowing that might arise would cause an increase in national debt.  The NTMA is continuing with its strategy of pre-funding to meet future redemptions.

These cover elements of an all-island SPS zone, as well as customs, and manufactured goods.  These non-papers do not constitute formal proposals from the UK, and do not amount to legally operational solutions.  </p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach stated after his recent meeting with Prime Minister Johnson in New York, there remains a significant gap between what the UK is putting forward, and what Ireland and the EU can accept. Neither Ireland nor the EU can move away from an agreed negotiated position to an unknown and untested solution. It is the UK&rsquo;s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement.</p></reply>

These should be raised with the European Commission. Negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU are a matter for the European Commission Task Force, led by chief negotiator Michel Barnier, and the UK Government. </p>  <p>   As both Michel Barnier and I have stated on numerous occasions it is up to the UK to provide proposals, which should be credible, concrete and legally operable and capable of achieving the same outcome as the backstop. This means that any solutions must avoid a hard border, fully protect the Good Friday Agreement and North-South cooperation, and preserve the all-island economy, as well the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. </p>  <p>   I met with Michel Barnier on 27 September and we had a chance to exchange views on our recent engagements with our British counterparts and to take stock together of where we are.  While contacts between the UK and Commission Taskforce are continuing, the Commission have made clear that the ideas and concepts presented by the UK are technical non-papers rather than detailed, credible proposals and would not be legally operable, nor deliver the same outcomes as the backstop.  The issue of a special economic zone was not discussed during the meeting and has not been raised by the UK during its ongoing discussions with the Task Force.</p>  <p>   It is important to acknowledge that Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement does put in place a specific arrangement for Northern Ireland which responds to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. The backstop provides alignment with those rules of the Single Market and Customs Union necessary to avoid a hard border, thus protecting the Good Friday Agreement, and to protect the Single Market. These arrangements enable Northern Ireland businesses to trade freely with both the rest of the UK and with the EU. </p>  <p>   A no deal outcome will never be the choice of Ireland, or the EU, but we cannot move away from an agreed negotiated position to an unknown and untested solution. Responsibility for avoiding a no deal outcome lies with the UK. </p></reply>

Ireland is now one of only 22 countries worldwide that have adopted national action plans on Business and Human Rights.</p>  <p>  A key action identified was the establishment of the Business and Human Rights Implementation Group to monitor delivery of the National Plan.   The Implementation Group, established in December 2018, is mandated to meet at least twice per year. I was pleased to be able to participate in the inaugural meeting of the Group on 16 January 2019.  The Group is chaired by Ms Breege O'Donoghue and brings together representatives of 23 organisations, from Government Departments and State Agencies, the business sector and civil society.  The Implementation Group went on to hold its first working meeting on 3 April 2019 and is scheduled to meet again in October. </p>  <p>  A second commitment of the National Plan was a comprehensive baseline assessment of the legislative and regulatory framework for business and human rights in Ireland. My Department commissioned independent consultants to carry out this research in 2018, the final report of which is available on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s website. At its meeting in April the Implementation Group considered the findings of the baseline assessment and the establishment of three sub-groups, each tasked with prioritising and delivering key actions under the three pillars of the UN Guiding Principles, namely, the state duty to protect, corporate responsibility to respect and access to remedy. </p></reply>

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of the proposals.  </p><p>Regarding question 39806/19, I am advised by Revenue that capital gains tax (CGT) entrepreneur relief applies to an individual who disposes of qualifying assets which have been owned by that individual for a continuous period of at least 3 years in the 5-year period immediately prior to the disposal of the assets. The rate of CGT on such disposals is 10%. </p><p>To qualify for CGT entrepreneur relief, the qualifying assets must have been used for the purposes of a qualifying business carried on by the individual disposing of the assets. Land which has been leased by an individual to a long-term tenant would not, therefore, qualify for the relief as it will not have been used for the purposes of a business carried on by the individual concerned.</p><p>Regarding Question No. 152, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the higher lifetime CGT limit in the UK which applies to their Entrepreneur Relief scheme. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that latest estimates suggest that the cost of increasing the lifetime limit to &euro;10 million, in the absence of any behavioural changes would have a full year cost of &euro;81 million.</p><p>The Department of Finance produces a TSG paper annually on Capital Taxes.

At the same time, the strong economic performance in recent years has also seen the debt-to-income ratio fall significantly. Balancing the books is a meaningful signal of an economy moving into a more mature, sustainable phase.</p>  <p>  That said, despite the very significant progress that has been made by this Government, at 104 per cent of GNI*, debt levels remain high by both historical and international standards. Indeed, on a per capita basis, public indebtedness stood at &euro;42,500 per person last year, amongst the highest in the OECD. Similarly, servicing of debt represents a significant operating cost for the State, with last year&rsquo;s annual payment close to the entire capital budget for 2018. These figures illustrate why fiscal sustainability remains a key priority for this Government, especially in view of the highly uncertain international environment, including the impact of Brexit, and less favourable demographics in the coming decades as the population ages.  </p>  <p>  In light of these risks, a responsible approach to managing the public finances is required. To that end, my Department recently published the Annual Report on Public Debt in Ireland 2019. This report provided in-depth analysis of current and future debt dynamics. The evidence provided in this report clearly illustrates the importance of continuing to reduce the public debt burden, while at the same time undertaking investment and structural reforms that boost domestic employment and income levels, as these can impact favourably on the burden of debt.</p></reply>

There are a further 297 personal injury claimants who have yet to settle their claims. I have been informed by the State Claims Agency that a further 92 personal injury claims settlements have now been agreed and are included in the current submission to the Fund. This brings the total number of personal injury claimants who have agreed settlements to 888.  In addition to the settled cases submitted to the Fund there have also been 21 cases where the claims were either dismissed or withdrawn and consequently there will be no draw on the Fund in respect of these claimants. The latest information from the liquidator indicates that the total value of all payments (settlements, legal costs, etc.) in the next tranche will be approximately &euro;6.9 million.</p>  <p>  Regarding when the next payments will be made, the Deputy will note that in accordance with the relevant legislation, there are certain steps to be completed in preparing any application to the High Court for payment from the ICF. These steps include the assessment and verification of each individual claim within the application by the State Claims Agency.  The Agency has advised my officials that the next application for a call on the fund for Setanta claims will likely be in the 2nd half of October 2019.</p>  <p>  In relation Deputy Chamber&rsquo;s request for an update on a particular case, my officials have checked this matter with the State Claims Agency and they have indicated that there is no claim outstanding, but that there is a refund of premiums due. They indicated that while  the refund of premiums for commercial and personal insurance policies is not covered by the Insurance Compensation fund, there is a possibility that a portion of any such refund due, may be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta's Insurance assets on completion of the liquidation process.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Liquidator continues to make every effort to settle these claims on the best possible terms, however, each and every one of these claimants are in the litigation process and consequently it is difficult to predict exactly when all of these claimants will settle. This in turn means it is not possible to say at this stage when it will be known whether there will be any money available to make any refund of premiums.  Consequently, any individual (or their solicitor) who has queries about either an outstanding claim or a refund of premiums  should contact the liquidator via phone at +353 (0)818 255 255 or via email at iesetanta@deloitte.ie.</p></reply>

SFCT is an excise duty that applies to coal and peat when first supplied in the State for use as a fuel. Neither the movement of solid fuel into the State nor the physical presence of solid fuel in the State generate a liability to SFCT. Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to coal coming into the State from Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border controls in relation to the movement of solid fuel into the State from other Member States. Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel entering the State from Northern Ireland. Similarly, the transportation or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.  </p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK will be come a third country and will be outside of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union.  Any imports of products from a third country, including the UK, will be subject to EU customs requirements.  The exact implications of this for trade and customs compliance between Ireland and Northern Ireland are currently the subject of discussions with the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  Currently in Northern Ireland, there is no carbon tax on coal and solid fuel environmental standards are lower than in the State. These factors combined with currency fluctuations and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s lower VAT rate on solid fuel can give rise to significant price differentials between the two jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  As I and my predecessor have pointed out before, the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities who have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel, collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards and to prosecute traders involved in selling coal that does not meet these standards. The Regulations also provide for the establishment of a register of coal suppliers by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is in contact with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that solid fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here. I understand that contacts are ongoing with a view to undertaking a number of joint operations and to explore the scope for follow up action by Revenue in relation to persons found to be in breach of environmental regulations.</p></reply>

Under this Directive, Member States are obliged to exempt certain fuels used for commercial aviation purposes from excise duty. The scope of this exemption must include jet fuel (which is the most commonly used heavy oil in air navigation) and must encompass such fuel used for intra-Community and international air transport purposes. A Member State may waive this exemption where it has entered into a bilateral agreement with another Member State to tax fuel for intra-community flights. With regard to fuel for international transport, the scope for a Member State to take a unilateral approach to taxation is limited by international law and a range of bilateral and multilateral agreements that operate under 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation (known as the Chicago Convention).  </p><p>VAT is charged on domestic and private usage of jet fuel at the reduced rate of 13.5%, while VAT is charged at the standard rate of 23% on aviation gasoline used for the same purpose.  The supply of aviation fuel for international air travel is zero rated and airline tickets are exempt from VAT throughout the EU.</p><p>I am advised that consumption data required to estimate the revenue that could be accrued, if the Excise Duty applied fully to aviation fuel with no exemptions, is not readily available. According to the CSO, the revenue foregone due to the excise exemption on aviation fuel was &euro;494 million in 2016. However, this is a theoretical amount that cannot be realised under the current EU and international legislative framework.</p><p>Finally, I am informed by Revenue that the breakdown of taxes levied on the different types of aviation fuel as provided for under the Finance Act 1999 and Energy Tax Directive are shown in the following table. <table><tr><th>Aviation Fuel/Use</th><th>Energy Tax Directive</th><th>Finance Act 1999</th></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for domestic commercial aviation </td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;355.44 per 1,000 litres (section 97B Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for intra-Community/international commercial   aviation</td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;355.44 per 1,000 litres (section 97B Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for private pleasure flying</td><td>Mandatory taxation</td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;587.71 per 1,000 litres (section 96 Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for domestic commercial aviation</td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Full exemption (section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for used for intra-Community/international commercial   aviation</td><td>Mandatory tax exemption, except where bilateral arrangement entered into with another Member State</td><td>Full exemption (section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for private pleasure flying</td><td>Mandatory taxation</td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;479.02 per 1,000 litres (section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This approach would align it with the current EU fiscal rules framework, whereby it could be accommodated as an &ldquo;unusual event&rdquo; under the existing Stability and Growth Pact provisions. Withdrawals from the Fund will be transferred directly to the Exchequer so as to support the tax shortfalls and/or voted expenditure to address the specific downturn.</p>  <p>  The Act deliberately does not describe specific events, such as Brexit or others, so as to give flexibility to Governments to withdraw from the Fund for all severe downturns, many of which are not possible to specify in advance. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the occurrence of a force majeure event could justify deployment of the Fund. Therefore, I expect a significant fiscal impact and/or an economic downturn arising from a no-deal Brexit would clearly allow for a drawdown from the Rainy Day Fund.  </p>  <p>  I should stress that a drawdown from the Rainy Day Fund should not be the first action taken in the face of a no-deal Brexit, as the Government has already taken significant steps to prepare for Brexit and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  These steps to prepare for the fallout of Brexit include dedicated measures, and economic and fiscal policies to get Ireland Brexit ready in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Such policies include, amongst others, moving to fiscal balance, the rolling out of support schemes, and the provision of advice to businesses.  </p>  <p>  I would, therefore, envisage the National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund only being used for an extreme outcome, i.e. &ldquo;tail-risks&rdquo; related to Brexit and in advance of seeking approval to withdraw from the Fund, the magnitude of the impact would have to be properly considered.</p>  <p>  My sensible approach to using the Rainy Day Fund is that I want to ensure its funds are available and used to support measures that are timely, targeted and temporary, which assist in converting our economy and its businesses to a post-Brexit world.</p></reply>

However it is possible that the cost could be lower due to the limits on the payable credit.  This cost does not take account of any possible behavioural change by companies to avail of the increased credit. </p>  <p>  Regarding Question No. 144, on the assumption that all SMEs avail of this proposal, and assuming no behavioural change, I am advised by Revenue that, while the measure would be cost-neutral over the longer term, the first year cost of the measure, based on the cashflow impact to the Exchequer, is likely to be of the order of c.&euro;57 million. This is due to the second and third installments of the repayable credit being paid along with the first installment.</p></reply>

The statement also includes detailed information on the levy process and its cost control and budgetary processes, including Commission approval of annual budgets, and oversight of quarterly outturns against those budgets. </p><p>Each phased increase required my or my predecessor's approval of the annual industry funding regulations.  In 2017, the then Minister for Finance approved a phased increase to 100% industry funding commencing with an increase from 50% to 65% in 2017<b></b>(S.I. No. 442/2017 - The Central Bank Act 1942 (Section 32D) Regulations 2017).  In 2018, I agreed to an increase in recovery rates from 65% to 80% (in certain categories) with corresponding increases in other categories (S.I. No. 445 of 2018 - The Central Bank Act 1942 (Section 32D) Regulations 2018).</p><p>At the time of this increase, the Central Bank issued a Funding Strategy and Guide to the 2018 Industry Funding Levy. This guide provides significant detail on the levy strategy and the plans to 2021.  The move towards full funding is part of a wider levy strategy, which includes moving to levying in arrears in the next levy cycle.  This will eliminate significant prior year shortfalls and surpluses which resulted in volatility in the past.  No levies will issue in 2019 as actual costs will be levied on an arrears basis in mid-2020.</p><p>Earlier this year, I agreed to the phased increase of all financial sectors to 100% funding by 2024.  However, I specifically provided for an exception for Credit Unions so they will only reach 50% funding by 2021.  This has been well flagged to the sector and I have also agreed to not increase credit union regulatory funding beyond 50%  until the impact of the move to 50% is reviewed and a further public consultation is undertaken.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-01a.239.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100100063#WRE01600"><p>The Deputy has raised several issues in his question concerning the answer I supplied to PQ No. 55 of 19 September 2019 about surcharges for those self-employed who fail to make a local property tax return or pay their LPT. As I set out in that response, as with other taxes and duties, penalties can be imposed for various offences such as failure to submit returns or other documentation or the provision of false information. </p>  <p>  Section 38 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for the imposition of such surcharges for the late payment of Local Property Tax. The challenge of compliance is particularly significant for LPT owing to the nature of the tax itself and the wide demographic liable for the tax, a significant proportion of which are not taxpayers to whom the standard collection and enforcement methods could be applied. Compliance is not just about ensuring the submission of returns and the payment of outstanding tax liabilities; there is also a timing aspect to compliance.  Returns must be submitted and payments must be made by a specified date(s).  The suggestion in the Deputy's question, of reducing a penalty to nil following the late submission of returns or payments, would only serve to incentivise such late submission. Likewise, as outlined in my previous response, a surcharge is designed to act as a deterrent and, when there is a late compliance, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability: this considered a fair and proportionate deterrent given the size of LPT liabilities.  </p>  <p>  In relation to comparisons between the treatment of PAYE workers and the self-employed, unlike self-employed taxpayers, PAYE taxpayers are not generally required to submit an annual income tax return. Therefore, it is not possible to impose a surcharge on PAYE taxpayers for failure to submit a return on time. Revenue&rsquo;s compliance actions are tailored according to the type of taxpayer involved and the most effective way to ensure compliance. This is illustrated by the use of the facility to collect LPT liabilities through mandatory deduction at source from a PAYE taxpayer&rsquo;s salary or pension, which is considered to be a fair approach in the context of the surcharge on income tax that can apply to self-employed taxpayers who fail to meet their LPT liabilities.  Moreover, all taxpayers who fail to submit an LPT return, or who submit an incorrect LPT return, are liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that would be payable with a correct return, subject to a maximum penalty of &euro;3,000.</p>  <p>  Adding  the LPT liability to a self-employed person&rsquo;s income tax liability, as the Deputy suggests, would not, of itself, ensure that the LPT was actually paid. This would not be a similar treatment to a PAYE taxpayer who has no choice about when, or how much of, his or her LPT liability is paid, where deduction at source by the employer or pension provider is made mandatory.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the vast majority of property owners pay their LPT on time. There is no reason for property owners to put themselves in a position where they become liable to a surcharge.  If an individual has particular financial circumstances which cause difficulties in meeting his or her LPT liability, he or she may be entitled to a deferral of the tax or may avail of one of a number of payment methods to discharge the liability evenly over the course of the year. </p></reply>

The implementation of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  </p>  <p>  The main findings of the Report, which have been accepted by Government, include:</p>  <p>  - An increase of 10% in the Military Service Allowance which is a unique payment to the Defence Forces and paid to the majority of ranks. The overall annual estimated cost of this measure is &euro;4.8m p.a. </p>  <p>  - Restoration of a 10% reduction in respect of duty allowances such as Security Duty Allowance and Patrol Duty Allowance that were introduced under the Haddington Road Agreement.  The 10% cuts to overseas allowances will also be restored.  The overall estimated cost of the restoration of these measures is &euro;3.3m p.a.</p>  <p>  - Restoration of premium weekend payment rates which were approximately halved under the Haddington Road Agreement. The annual estimated cost of this measure is &euro;1.4m p.a.</p>  <p>  - Restoration of the Pilots Service Commitment Scheme for Flying Officers which is aimed at attracting pilots to continue in service on being able to stand down from the Air Corps. This Scheme was withdrawn in 2010.  The cost of this measurE is estimated at &euro;600k pa depending on take up.</p>  <p>  A high level plan for the implementation of all of the recommendations in the Report has been approved and work will commence on the actions in the plan immediately.  The above measures are in addition to the current Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) which is currently delivering pay benefits of between 7.4% and 6.2% (or up to 10% for new entrants hired after 2012) for our public servants, including Defence Force personnel at a cost of over &euro;1.1bn, out to 2021.  The Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations on the Defence Forces taken together with the pay measures provided for under the PSSA, represent a tangible package of pay improvements at this time for the members of our Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Public pay has been, and continues to be, determined in a public service wide context in Ireland and in a collective bargaining context under the framework of successive public service agreements.  This is appropriate given the size of the Irish public service and in the interests of maintaining control of the public finances.   There are no plans to change these arrangements. </p></reply>

A number of measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure and budgetary targets are being achieved on an ongoing basis. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Fiscal Monitor.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-August 2019 was &euro;42,015 million. This is &euro;262 million, or 0.6% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;38,653 million, is &euro;132 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-August. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;3,362 million, is &euro;130 million, or 3.7% below profile and up &euro;683 million, or 25.5% on the same period last year. The end-September Fiscal monitor will be published later this week.</p>  <p>  Due to the scale of Government expenditure, over &euro;66 billion in aggregate for 2019, and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons. This includes in-year policy decisions, timing issues, overspends in particular areas and the need to respond to emerging events where Departments do not have scope to deliver offsetting savings.</p>  <p>  Looking at policy decisions that would require a Supplementary Estimate, this would include the decision in relation to this year&rsquo;s Social Welfare Christmas Bonus.  Turning to  areas where there are potential pressures that would give rise to overspends, as outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, there are particular challenges in the area of Health taking into account the year-on-year increase and the expenditure profile for the last quarter of the year, and also in Justice arising from pressures in relation to Asylum Seekers Accommodation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the continued uncertainty in relation to the timing of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union has required that the impacted Departments and Offices incur expenditure to ensure that we are in a position to respond to the emerging position. To the extent that offsetting underspends are not available this would necessitate certain Supplementary Estimates.</p>  <p>  At this stage in the year, it is too early to definitively state what the requirement for Supplementary Estimates will be at year-end. The White Paper to be published this Friday will set out the aggregate forecast expenditure outturn for the year taking into account an assessment of potential Supplementary Estimate requirements.   Expenditure Report 2020, which will be published on Budget Day, will set out an initial assessment on a Vote Group basis of any necessary additional expenditure for 2019. </p>  <p>  Turning to the question of particularly sensitive areas that may require additional resources in the coming year, in light of the current position in relation to the UK's exit from the EU, Budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit. Underlying this decision is the need to ensure the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of the Brexit challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. This strategy involves a &lsquo;twin-track&rsquo; approach of providing funding for key public services and also supporting the sectors and regions most exposed to Brexit related disruption. </p>  <p>  Maintaining sustainable expenditure policy is an important element of meeting our EU obligations in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal policy more generally. This includes ensuring that we are achieving the greatest possible impact with public expenditure and delivering high quality public services in an efficient and effective manner. A range of reforms have been put in place over the last number of years with the aim of focusing attention on achieving value for money. For example, the Performance Budgeting initiative seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure. </p>  <p>  My Department has also just come to the end of year three of this phase of the Spending Review process. The Spending Review aims to place evidence at the centre of policy development, through the examination of existing policies and programmes to assess their efficiency and effectiveness. This systematic examination of existing expenditure can support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities. A number of papers resulting from the review process were published over the summer, with the remainder due to be published alongside the Expenditure Report on Budget Day. </p>  <p>  Over the last number of years, maintaining sustainable expenditure policy has also been crucial in restoring our economy following the economic crisis. Following a period of consolidation, the last number of years have seen moderate, sustainable expenditure growth on an annual basis. The Government has prioritised spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity whilst making incremental and sustainable improvements in public services. The steady growth in expenditure in recent years reflects the significant effort made by this Government to moderate the level of expenditure increases and to secure a sustainable long-term path to growth.</p></reply>

Compared to the end 2014 outturn, gross voted expenditure in 2019 is profiled to be 25% higher as set out in section 2.2 of the Budget 2019 Expenditure Report. Indeed, in 2019, &euro;66.6 billion has been allocated to gross voted expenditure. In absolute terms this is higher than the outturn of just over &euro;63 billion in 2009. Recent increases in voted expenditure have been significantly more modest than what was seen in the pre-consolidation period, with gross voted expenditure growing by nearly 55% between 2004 and 2009, while ensuring that the standards of Ireland's public services continue to improve. </p>  <p>  This Government has delivered budgetary strategies based on steady increases in public expenditure underpinned by stable and predictable tax revenue.

The unwinding process is progressively weighted towards those at the lower levels of pay (who will see their salaries increase relative to 2008), and is implemented on a phased basis.</p><p>By end 2019, salary rates up to &euro;50,000 will be fully restored. By end 2020, salary rates up to &euro;70,000 (over 90% of the public service) will be fully restored.</p><p>For public servants who have not achieved full restoration of the FEMPI reductions by October 2020 (i.e the date of the last PSSA increase), restoration of the amount must be completed by way of Ministerial order. This order must be made on the following dates:</p><p>For those with a post - PSSA salary of under &euro;150,000:</p><p>- Covered public servants: a date after 1 October 2020 but before 1 July 2021. </p><p>For those with a post - PSSA salary in excess of &euro;150,000:</p><p>- Covered public servants: a date after 1 October 2020 but before 1 July 2022.  </p><p>Under the terms of the FEMPI Act 2013, I am obliged to carry out an annual review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the FEMPI Acts, having regard to the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness. In this annual review, I am also to consider whether or not any of the provision of the relevant Acts continue to be necessary having regard to the purposes of those Acts, the revenues of the State and State commitments in respect of public service pay and pensions.</p><p>In my 2019 annual review, a written report of which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 26th June, I recommended the continuation of the unwinding of the FEMPI measures in line with the terms agreed under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 &ndash; 2020 and provisions enacted in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. </p></reply>

Two notable examples are the establishment of a centralised Office of Government Procurement with responsibility (together with the key sectors of Health, Defence, Education and Local Government) for sourcing goods and services on behalf of the Public Service, and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, established to lead the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy in cooperation with departments and agencies across the Public Service. The Deputy can be assured that public service reform remains an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy to enable us to continue to improve outcomes for the public. </p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 &ndash; the current phase of public service reform, which became operational during 2018 &ndash; represents a whole-of-public-service initiative designed to build on previous reforms, while expanding the scope of reform to focus on collaboration, innovation and evaluation. Our Public Service 2020 seeks better outcomes for the public, to support innovation and collaboration and to build public service organisations that are resilient and agile. </p>  <p>  A Public Service Leadership Board (PSLB) has been established to lead the delivery of Our Public Service 2020. For the first time, both civil and public service leaders and managers will work jointly to drive the reform programme. This will ensure there is shared ownership for the actions on reform right across the public service.</p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 also contains an added focus on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture and in developing indicators to support an outcomes focus. With this goal in mind, within my Department we have established a Reform Evaluation Unit to focus on monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of reform as well as creating greater links between expenditure and reform.</p>  <p>  Further details on the progress that we have already made will be available in the first progress report on Our Public Service 2020, which I will publish very shortly in conjunction with my colleague Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, and information and up-dates on the full range of OPS2020 activities can also be accessed at the website OPS2020.gov.ie from mid-October. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is sustainable and that Public Sector policy continues to facilitate good economic performance in the future. There are a number of budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews. The actions in Our Public Service 2020 will also ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services over the coming years, without impacting negatively on economic performance.</p></reply>

The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.  </p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents/guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.</p><p>My Department has no role either in making or deciding on enrolment applications to schools or keeping waiting lists. In these matters, schools are required to adhere to the requirements of relevant legislation and the policies of my department. </p><p>Where there is no school placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, funding for the provision of home tuition is available to Parents as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. The availability of a school placement is assessed by the local SENO having regard the relevant diagnosis and relevant professional report. </p><p>As this question relates to a particular child, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply.</p></reply>

Increased levels of lifelong learning will ensure that those in the workforce, and outside the workforce, are supported to take advantage of these developments.</p>  <p>  The National Strategy for Higher Education (2010) and the National Skills Strategy (2016) were published to ensure that the education system is appropriately structured to meet the challenges of this rapid rate of change and facilitate ongoing upskilling and reskilling of the workforce.  </p>  <p>  The higher education system is delivering programmes in a more flexible manner than before. There were 7,967 remote enrolments and 40,101 part-time enrolments in the higher education system in the 2017/2018 academic year.  An increase of 70% in remote enrolments and 12% in part time enrolments over four years.  </p>  <p>  The private higher education ranking systems, of which there are many, each monitor different aspects of international higher education institutions.  The systems award different weightings to various components of the area under review.  </p>  <p>  The outcome of the rankings in any particular year therefore not only depend on how an individual institution has performed, but also on how it has performed in relation to all other institutions under review.  </p>  <p>  In the context of overall system performance progression and excellence, the fulfilment of specific broader Government policies may also impact on rankings.  For example, national policy on Initial Teacher Education (ITE) saw the incorporation of a number of smaller teacher training colleges in Mater Dei, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Drumcondra and CICE into Dublin City University in accordance with recommendations by the Report of the International Review Panel on the Structure of ITE Provision in Ireland (2012 Sahlberg Report). </p>  <p>  This beneficial policy objective increased the proportions of undergraduate students in the university, which, in turn, impacted negatively on the Universty&rsquo;s ranking in some systems. This reflects the narrow and distorting views which can be encapsulated in university ranking methodologies.</p>  <p>  The European Commission fund a ranking system (U-multirank) which focuses on the needs of students and end users, producing summaries of specific areas of interest (where measures are rated from &lsquo;very good&rsquo; to &lsquo;weak&rsquo;) rather than a blunt ranking number, this provides a more accurate view of how institutions are improving/changing year on year.</p></reply>

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.</p><p>No school has lost a full special education teaching post as a result of the re profiling process.</p><p>There  has also been be no reduction to the overall number of special education teaching posts within the school system. There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. </p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy has 20 special education teaching hours, or 0.8 of a special education teacher post, for an enrolment of 83 pupils at the time the profile was developed.</p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools on their website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>Schools were advised that the appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019. An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>The NCSE wrote to schools on 31st May, 2019 to advise them of the outcome of the appeals. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts, in accordance with these criteria, will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>This process will recommence in the coming weeks.</p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

Where the number of applications from non-eligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, tickets are allocated using a random selection process.   </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the scheme, the number of spare seats varies from year to year, based on the capacity of the buses running on all of the various routes and the number of eligible children accommodated on each route. Hence there is no guarantee that a non-eligible child who received a place in a previous year will receive a seat the following year.  It is included in the terms and conditions on the Bus &Eacute;ireann online application that availability of seats may vary from year to year and that concessionary transport cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is not attending their nearest post-primary centre and is therefore not eligible for transport.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that the service in question is operating to capacity.</p></reply>

Schools should consider how best to support any additional needs in the context of the Continuum of Support if appropriate.

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,953 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen either in the context of any pay review mechanism agreed by the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement, or in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring.</p></reply>

The precise nature of the arrangements have to be considered by each school having regards to the particular circumstances  in question including factors such as the numbers of children involved, the ages of those children and the availability of staff and physical space in the school concerned.  </p>  <p>  The Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector (2012) acknowledged that denominational religious education, including faith formation and sacramental preparation are long-established features of the primary system. With regard to denominational religious education in primary schools, the Forum&rsquo;s Report did not recommend that it be removed from the school day.  </p>  <p>  However, the Advisory Group had concerns about the amount of time which can be devoted to sacramental preparation in some schools and they recommended that it should not be allowed to encroach on time allocated for the general curriculum.  They also recommended on-going discussion with parents and clergy in this regard. </p>  <p>  Multi-denominational schools, such as Community National Schools, teach a multi-belief and values curriculum, which is inclusive of all children. In such schools, faith formation and preparation for religious sacraments takes place outside of school hours.</p></reply>

These necessitate a collaborative approach to policing with law enforcement agencies north and south of the border. </p><p>In November 2015, the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the agreement <i>A Fresh Start, The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan</i>, as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.  These measures included the creation of the Joint Agency Task Force. </p><p>Both Governments are determined that, regardless of the political outcome of Brexit, the excellent ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland must and will continue to combat the threat posed by dissidents and criminals that seek to exploit the policing challenges posed by the border.</p><p>Last week, I attended the 17th Annual Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime in Co. Cavan, aimed at enhancing cooperation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, particularly in relation to cross border organised criminality and related issues. I met with the Permanent Secretary of the Northern Ireland Department of Justice, the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI in the margins of this conference, where we discussed matters relating to security in the border region, both now and in the context of Brexit. </p><p>I recently spoke to the Home Secretary and have also met the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I can assure the Deputy that I took these opportunities to reaffirm our deep commitment to continuing the close working relationship that we have with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and we discussed matters including security and risks in the Border region.  </p><p>It is also important to note that the Garda Commissioner recently made an operational decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit (ASU) in Cavan which became operational this week.  It will complement the work of the Units nationwide, including those in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth in the Northern Region.  </p><p>The Northern region also continues to benefit from the accelerated recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, supported by the unprecedented level of Government funding to the organisation.  Garda strength in the Northern Region has increased to approximately 1,500, an increase of 150 Garda&iacute; since the end of 2017.  These Garda&iacute; are supported by approximately 150 Garda staff in the region, which represents an increase of almost 30% over the past 3 years, which means that additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect.</p><p>Requirements in the region will in the usual way be kept under ongoing review by Garda management. In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, I understand from the Commissioner that further resources can and will be provided as needed.</p></reply>

Indeed the first message developed through the work of the forum has also been produced. This message relates to marking personal property for ease of recovery and return in the event of theft or burglary and it is due to be circulated imminently, via email to the combined reach of the Forum, consisting of over 1 million households nationwide. </p>  <p>  There will also be a nationwide engagement day in hundreds of locations on Friday 22   November 2019. The full details of this day are still being finalised, but it is certain tobe a great opportunity for members of the public to meet with their local community Garda, who will be able to discuss issues of local concern and offer practical crime prevention advice.</p>  <p>  It is not currently envisaged that the Forum will incur significant costs going forward; however, should this change, my Department will re-examine funding of the Forum as the situation calls for it. </p>  <p>  The National Rural Safety Forum is an initiative which I am delighted to support, as Minister for Justice and Equality.

The offer of accommodation and related services to applicants is just that - an offer. There is no obligation on any applicant to accept that offer and there is no restriction on their freedom of movement throughout the State. Some applicants choose to stay with friends or family who are already living in the State or to source and provide for their own private accommodation if they have independent means. </p>  <p>  Applicants who have been granted a labour market access permission and are employed or in self-employment now have the economic independence to allow them to make further choices regarding their accommodation situation. To date, the Minister for Justice and Equality has granted over 3,100 labour market access permissions. </p>  <p>  International protection applicants have a temporary permission to remain in the State while their application is being examined and are therefore ineligible for social housing supports like HAP.  </p>  <p>  There are, however, approximately 850 people with an international protection status or a permission to remain who continue to reside in our accommodation centres. These people are no longer applicants and are no longer in the international protection process. They have the same right to housing assistance and supports as Irish nationals and EEA citizens. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department does not record how many of these people have applied for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). People with status or permission to remain seeking accommodation in the wider community can choose to apply for HAP, or they may wish to use other means to pay for their accommodation.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged DePaul Ireland, the Jesuit Refugee Service and the Peter McVerry Trust to provide assistance to them to find accommodation. Information supplied to us by these organisations indicates that most people who find accommodation are availing of the HAP.  In addition, my Department is working with other Government Departments, local authorities and the City and County Managers&rsquo; Association to help these people to transition to longer-term accommodation in the community.</p></reply>

The permission is renewable until there is a final decision on their protection application.  Eligible applicants have access to all sectors of employment, with the exception of the Civil and Public Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Irish Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) of my Department that as of 26 September 2019, there are a total of 7,355 persons residing in accommodation provided by IPAS.  This represents an overall increase of 1,827 persons from the date of the signing of the The European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018.  </p>  <p>  In this regard the Deputy may wish to note that direct provision services are offered to those who come to Ireland and apply for international protection (asylum). These services are demand led and generally it is difficult to predict demand far in advance. Therefore, it is not possible to link the introduction of the right to work for protection applicants with any change in the number of adults or families living in direct provision centres, as application numbers are impacted by a number of factors, including international developments.</p></reply>

This was the biggest reform to the system in twenty years and it introduced a single application procedure where all aspects of a person's application (refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain) are examined and determined in one process. Prior to this, the three strands were examined sequentially and this could lead to long delays in obtaining a final decision.</p>  <p>  Upon the commencement of the 2015 Act, approximately 3,500 legacy cases were carried over to be dealt with under the new single application procedure (1,500 of these cases were from the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and 2,000 from the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal).  A further 500 cases transitioned in the months following commencement.  These cases would have been the longest in the system at the commencement of the Act.  </p>  <p>  The International Protection Office (IPO) committed to scheduling these legacy cases for interview by the end of 2018 and for completion by the end of Q2 2019, where possible.</p>  <p>  The IPO achieved the first part of this commitment in 2018 by scheduling all transition cases for interview, where it was possible to do so. The vast majority of the legacy cases have now been processed to completion in the IPO, and the focus is now on post commencement single procedure cases.  </p>  <p>  Some legacy cases will continue to be dealt with including transition applicants who have not co-operated up to this point and are now re-engaging with the process, applicants who have come back into the process through Judicial Review, or for other reasons.  These cases are prioritised and scheduled for interview at the earliest possible opportunity and processed accordingly.</p>  <p>  New applicants arriving today at the International Protection Office (IPO), who complete their questionnaire, are being scheduled for interview as follows: </p>  <p>  - for prioritised applications, within 5 months of application; and</p>  <p>  - for non-prioritised applications, within 8 to 10 months. </p>  <p>  Prioritised cases include applicants from refugee generating countries like Syria or Eritrea or from especially vulnerable groups like unaccompanied minors.  </p>  <p>  The IPO target is to issue its recommendation within 8 weeks after the interview.  This is, however, dependent on the complexity of the case. The overall median processing time for applications processed under the International Protection Act 2015 to end August 2019 is 15.7 months with prioritised cases being processed in 8.7 months.</p>  <p>  Processing times are being monitored on an ongoing basis and the IPO continue to work on means to further improve them. The aim is to reduce processing times for first instance recommendations to 9 months.</p></reply>

This process has involved my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities. </p>  <p>  On foot of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it was agreed by all attendees at the last meeting of the group that, in the main, current legislative provisions appeared to be sufficient. Nonetheless it was also agreed that the group would remain open to considering workable legislative solutions to any specific legislative gaps specifically identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  My officials wrote to the Garda Commissioner to seek his formal views on the matter. A response was received on 28 June and has since been shared with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as a primary contributor to the work of the cross-agency group. The response from the Office of the Garda Commissioner does suggest potential legislative changes which the organisation believes could assist in improving policing in this area.</p>  <p>  These proposals are receiving detailed consideration in my Department and it is expected that the cross-agency group will reconvene shortly to further scrutinise these proposals and to ascertain whether they can be progressed alongside targeted enforcement measures, awareness raising and youth engagement, which will be key to success in combatting this behaviour.</p></reply>

Accordingly, fireworks can only be imported into the country under licence and stored and sold in accordance with explosives law.  </p><p>I am satisfied that the current law in Ireland governing the use of fireworks is particularly robust. </p><p>As Deputies may be aware, fireworks are classified into four separate categories, depending on their level of hazard and whether they require specialist knowledge for use.  Category F1 is the least hazardous category and covers party poppers and sparklers, while Category F4 represents the most hazardous.</p><p>In the interests of safety and security, it is Government policy to restrict the availability of the more hazardous fireworks to the general public - including categories F2, F3 and F4.  A licence is required to import fireworks in any of these categories. </p><p>I can further confirm that licences under the Explosives Act are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators. </p><p>Under Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, it is an offence:</p><p>-for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence,</p><p>-to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, and</p><p>-to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</p><p>Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 also gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks.  </p><p>The penalties provided for in connection with these offences are very severe.  Having unlicensed fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply can result in a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment. Igniting fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalty. </p><p>More generally, the Deputy may also be interested to know that each year, as Halloween approaches, special efforts are made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</p><p>To complement this added Garda attention, my Department also runs an annual advertising campaign in the run-up to Halloween, highlighting the illegality of fireworks as well public safety aspects of their use. This campaign will be launched in the coming weeks in print media as well as online, including on social media platforms.</p></reply>

This is a major landmark piece of reforming legislation which provides for the establishment, for the first time, of a Judicial Council comprising all members of the judiciary. The primary function of the Council will be to promote and maintain excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions and high standards of conduct among judges. The Board of the Council will be responsible for carrying out the functions of the Council on a day-to-day basis. </p>  <p>  I envisage that the Judicial Council will be established by the end of this year and a great deal of work is underway to facilitate establishment within that time frame.

These provisions concern the appointment of the interim Secretary to the Council, and the process of identifying and recommending to the Government, persons who are suitable for appointment to be lay members of the Sentencing Guidelines and Information Committee, the Judicial Conduct Committee and panels of inquiry. The membership of other Committees such as the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee does not include lay members.</p>  <p>  The commencement of these provisions will enable the Council to commence its work on establishment day and the Committees of the Council to undertake their functions within the time frames specified in the Act. </p>  <p>  Committees of the Council will be established by the Council having regard to the timelines set out in the Act. The Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee is to be established no later than 3 months after the first meeting of the Judicial Council itself, and that Committee is to meet no later than one month after its establishment.  </p></reply>

The Deputy should be aware that I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no responsibility or influence as regards such matters. The regulation of private health insurance is solely a matter for the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), which is the statutory regulator of the private health insurance market in the State. </p><p>I can advise the Deputy that it has always been the case that students seeking an immigration permission to reside in the State must prove that they have sufficient finances to support themselves without recourse to State funds. This includes the necessity to provide proof of individual private health insurance or medical insurance as part of a group insurance scheme operated by the college/school or travel insurance. This would provide the student with adequate medical insurance cover in Ireland.</p><p>I understand that the High Court judgment provides that private medical insurance for non-EEA nationals, who are considered  as being ordinarily resident in the State for the purpose of the Health Insurance Act 1994, are, as a result of the judgment, subject to the principle of community-rating. In this regard, while the judgment changes the requirements for the way private medical insurance is operated for non-EEA nationals, it does not, in itself, change immigration policy and the requirements for non-EEA students wishing to study in Ireland.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that there is an appeal pending on the judgment and as a result it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on matters that are before the Courts and therefore sub judice. </p><p>However, officials of my Department have had ongoing contact with the relevant officials in the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills to discuss issues relevant to the judgment.

Our business target for processing short-stay 'C' visas is within eight weeks  and current processing time in Dublin for most types of short-stay visas is around four weeks.  The processing time an individual visa at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times for individual applications inevitably vary as a result.  </p>  <p>  I am also advised by the Immigration Service  that the visa service is experiencing an increase in the number of visa applications across most categories, in line with increased economic activity generally.  Notwithstanding this, processing times are on a par with, and in many cases, better than the same period last year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to keep processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.  This has included the assignment of additional staff to deal with applications, and more generally the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  The position in this regard is being kept under review.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department, by e-mail, using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is a child&ndash;centred Act which addresses the rights of children to legal security, to the care of their parents and important adults in their lives, and to equality before the law.  The reforms in family law provided for in that Act recognise the crucial role of parents and the need for a child to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents.  </p>  <p>  Married parents of a child are automatically joint guardians and have joint custody of their children. Where married parents separate or divorce, they can decide between themselves on custody arrangements for their children or apply to the courts to decide on the matter. If the father is not married to the mother of the child, he will not automatically become a guardian of the child. The issue of automatic guardianship was considered during the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Bill through the Oireachtas. However, the automatic extension of guardianship to a father who is not involved and is not participating in his child&rsquo;s life would have consequences for the child and the child&rsquo;s mother, for example, if he does not consent to the issue of a passport or to the placement of a child for adoption. </p>  <p>  There are provisions in place to facilitate non-marital fathers who have an ongoing relationship with their children to become guardians of their children. Section 2(4A) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as inserted by section 43(c) of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) now provides for joint guardianship by a man who was not married to the mother of the child and was cohabiting with the mother for not less than 12 consecutive months. This 12 month period must include a period, occurring at any time after the birth of the child, of not less than 3 months during which both the mother and father have lived with the child. In addition, a father who is not married to the child's mother and does not satisfy the cohabitation requirements may become a guardian if the parents jointly make a statutory declaration appointing him as a guardian. It is also open to the father at any stage to make an application to court for guardianship of the child under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Article 42A.4 of the Constitution requires that provision be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings concerning the guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child in such proceedings.  These factors include the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with each of his or her parents.  The courts shall have regard to all of these factors or circumstances that it regards as being relevant to the child concerned and his or her family and make its decision accordingly.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that either parent of a child, whether or not he or she is also a guardian of the child, may apply to court for a direction regarding the custody of a child or the right of access to the child.  Section 11D of the 1964 Act obliges the court in proceedings under section 11 to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with each of his or her parents on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  Section 25 of the 1964 Act also requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in guardianship, custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  </p>  <p>  Section 12A of the 1964 Act (inserted by section 58 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that in making any order under the Act, the court may impose such conditions as it considers to be necessary in the best interests of the child.  It is a matter for the courts when making orders under the 1964 Act in relation to matters such as the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child to determine the best interests of the child and to consider whether or not any conditions should be attached to such orders.  </p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 made provision to assist parents who need to return to court because the other parent has breached a court order in relation to custody of, or access to, a child. Section 56 of the 2015 Act inserted a new section 18A into the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  This provides that where a parent or guardian of a child has been granted custody of or access to the child under the 1964 Act, but he or she has been unreasonably denied such custody or access by another guardian or parent, that person may apply to court for an enforcement order.  </p>  <p>  Court orders in relation to guardianship, custody and access are of course a matter for the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.</p></reply>

A number of other relevant bodies, including the National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also involved in operational activity where appropriate. The objective of the Task Force is to build on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational law enforcement actions.</p><p>The Strategic Oversight Group of the Task Force is jointly chaired at senior management level by the two police services, to provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.  This group also includes senior personnel from relevant agencies.  As a multi-agency coordination structure, the Task Force does not have a separate staffing complement or budget. Personnel from the participating agencies in both jurisdictions are assigned for specific operations and other capacities from the relevant agencies are deployed as required by operational demands.</p><p>The Task Force has made strong progress in tackling cross-border criminal activity across a range of crime areas.  These include not just traditional smuggling activities, but also rural and farm crimes, organised burglary and drug crime. </p><p>The multi-agency nature of the Task Force is critical to its success. It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, as well as specific joint investigations which take place when individual crime incidents with a cross border dimension occur, such as the one underway into a recent horrific case of abduction and assault. </p><p>Last week, together with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, senior officers from all the agencies and senior officials from Department of Justice Northern Ireland and my own Department, I attended the 17th Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime in Co. Cavan.  This is an annual event, aimed at enhancing cooperation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, particularly in relation to cross border organised criminality and related issues.  Operational members of the Task Force came together at the conference, which provided an opportunity to consider in detail the necessary improvements and innovations, including international co-operation. While the work of the Task Force is reviewed as part of the annual cross border conference on organised crime, there is ongoing multiagency engagement in relation to operations to tackle cross border crime.</p></reply>

However, the primary television companies in this regard are not based in this jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I have no statutory function in regard to the selling of replica shirts or the sponsors mentioned thereon.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-01a.618.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100100069#WRL04800"><p>Approximately 95% of all penalty point offences are endorsed by the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) on driver licences every year.  This is an exceptional rate of endorsement. </p>  <p>  Over 85% of penalty point offence records are received directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when the offender opts to pay the fixed charge amount and accept the penalty points. The remainder - the minority - are received from the Courts Service, following convictions. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am acutely aware of the road traffic enforcement challenges that result from the non-surrender of driving licences.</p>  <p>  In the case of roadside intercept detections, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can record the driving licence details obtained at the point of interception. This can ultimately be used to apply penalty points, should there be a conviction. In such instances, the recording of a licence in court may not be necessary. </p>  <p>  However, an issue may still arise where the licence details are not obtained at the point of interception.  For example, in the case of non-intercept speed camera detections, the registration of the vehicle is captured on detection.  If a driver does not pay his/her Fixed Charge Notice and is subsequently convicted, his/her licence details should be recorded in Court in accordance with section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 2016.  Unfortunately, there are instances when the Court is unable to record licence details, for example when licences are reported to the Court as lost or forgotten, or where persons are convicted of speeding while also driving without a licence.  There are also some drivers who wilfully choose not to attend Court and are convicted in absentia. Again, there is no licence to record in these cases. </p>  <p>  In cases where a licence is not provided, I understand that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has the facility, in certain instances, to look up the National Vehicle and Driver File and successfully apply penalty points, based on exact matching against the offence's vehicle registration details.</p>  <p>  I can also confirm to the Deputy that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority, the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na met in August to discuss road traffic enforcement and that the non-production of driving licences was one of the matters discussed at this meeting. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS)) Working Group, chaired by officials from both my Department and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and attended by the Courts Service among other agencies, actively monitors progress and relevant developments in the area of road traffic enforcement. I have asked my officials to meet with Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Courts Service via this forum to discuss how the process of obtaining driver information upon conviction is currently operating under section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 2016. The Working Group will meet during October and I can confirm to the Deputy that this important enforcement issue will be discussed. I am happy to update the Deputy further after the appropriate meeting has taken place.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the Master Licence Record programme, established by Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is implementing further measures to assist in endorsement of penalty points by matching vehicle and driver records on the NVDF. This project will go some way to addressing the issue of 'unmatched offences' by matching vehicle and driver records on the NVDF, and, over time, by establishing owner identity for all vehicle records. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Shane Ross, T.D., who has responsibility for road traffic legislation that, due to legislative and operational issues, full population of the Master Licence Record Programme is likely to take several years.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to acknowledge that there will be always be complex scenarios when attempting to endorse driving licences in respect of road traffic offences; for example, instances where the vehicle owner is not driving at the time of an offence, or when an offending vehicle is owned by a company. It is equally important to note that disqualified drivers constitute a major component of those who do not surrender driving licences. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be aware that Minister Ross has proposed the amendment of section 40 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 to remove the existing Garda discretion to allow a driver 10 days in which to produce his/her licence/learner permit at a Garda station and, as a result, to provide for the mandatory carry of licence/permit. This proposal will be discussed further over the coming period. </p></reply>

Complexities may also arise at local level, for example a client living in County Limerick may choose to apply for legal aid to Ennis Law Centre.

This Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants. Article 21 of the Directive requires Member States, in implementing the Directive, to take into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons, and Article 22 provides for the assessment of the special reception needs of vulnerable persons.</p>  <p>  Ireland transposed the Directive by way of the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018. While there is no formal procedure in place for vulnerability assessments, Regulation 8 refers to vulnerable persons and provides for an assessment in relation to an applicant's special reception needs within 30 days of presentation or application.  </p>  <p>  Every applicant has an initial interview conducted when they first attend the International Protection Office in Dublin. If the applicant indicates that they require accommodation , he or she will then be assessed for any specific reception needs. The result of the assessment is taken into account when assigning accommodation to the individual. </p>  <p>  Applicants are also invited for an initial health assessment on a voluntary basis. A Health Screening Team, which is funded and managed by the HSE, is located onsite at the Balseskin Reception Centre for this purpose. The team comprises of GPs, a Medical Officer, a Clinical Nurse Specialist and two nurses, a primary care social worker, two primary care psychologists and clerical/administration support. The team offers a range of individual services and screening for medical and psychosocial needs and makes onward referrals for any further treatment required. These health professionals communicate with my officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS - formerly RIA), within the bounds of patient confidentiality, if a particular need is identified that will impact the person's accommodation requirements. In the coming weeks, a new primary care facility will be opening in Balseskin, which will enable the health care team to provide their services in a facility that is to the standard of all new HSE primary care facilities. </p>  <p>  In addition, arrangements are in place with Safetynet, who carry out health screening in various parts of the country on behalf of the HSE, to offer the screening service to those who do not, for whatever reason, avail of it in Dublin. Staff from Safetynet liaise with the IPAS if the person is deemed vulnerable on medical or related grounds. This can include a request that special arrangements should be taken regarding the assignment of the person's accommodation, for example if they need to be located near a particular hospital. </p>  <p>  My Department is continually reviewing how to improve services to applicants and my officials are currently examining the options available for putting in place a formal procedure for the identification and assessment of those applicants deemed to be vulnerable in accordance with Article 21 of the Reception Conditions Directive.</p>  <p>  To assist in determining how best we can meet the health and related needs of applicants, the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has recently commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving our existing processes. I look forward to the outcome of this research.</p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that all Departments and their agencies involved in the delivery of services and supports to applicants have a role to play in identifying and addressing the needs of applicants who present as vulnerable. This is particularly the case where vulnerabilities may only be disclosed or become evident after the initial stage of the protection process.  </p>  <p>  For the purposes of the Directive and Regulation 8 of the 2018 Regulations, vulnerable persons include minors, unaccompanied minors, disabled people, elderly people, pregnant women, single parents, victims of human trafficking, persons with serious illnesses, persons with mental disorders and persons who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence, such as victims of female genital mutilation.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>I would point out however that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p><p>The Deputy will be interested to note that a new &ldquo;Community Policing Framework&rdquo; is currently at an advanced stage. I understand that this new Framework will take into account the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI), under which it is envisaged that community policing may be a specialism in some urban areas. In rural areas, community policing may be more of a hybrid model whereby all Garda&iacute; in a District have a community responsibility but also attend to normal policing duties.</p><p>The number of Community Garda&iacute; serving in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31 August 2019, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is 724.</p><p>I think it is also important to note the welcome roll-out of the new operating model of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This meets a key commitment in <i>A Policing Service for the Future, </i>the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. </p><p>The Garda Operating Model re-organises resources around the delivery of front-line policing, placing an increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting victims of crime. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in each Division, there will be a dedicated Superintendent leading a community engagement team.  I am confident that this reorganisation will further strengthen community policing and engagement, and provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each Division nationwide.</p></reply>

The programme is an essential part of Government strategy to help tackle youth crime, administered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it is very important that it operates effectively. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, serious issues arose in relation to the handling of cases which had been deemed unsuitable for the Garda Youth Diversion Programme.  These issues did not involve any negative implications for the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme itself, which is a valuable mechanism to help young offenders turn away from crime. </p>  <p>  The operation of the programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly supported by a nationwide network of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects, which are funded by my Department and operated by community-based organisations.  The projects receive referrals from a number of sources, but primarily from the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that an expert Steering Group is currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy, including a review of the Children Act. The Steering Group commenced its work in February and has had a series of meetings during this year which will continue into next year. The Group is tasked with advising and guiding the development of the new Strategy, including consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, from early intervention and preventative work, including family support, diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  This lead in timeframe ensures that sufficient staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. There are many complex strands to this preparatory work, including the involvement of multiple organisations.  </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations.  </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016) commenced provisions of the Act to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018). </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on preparing for commencement of the remainder of the 2015 Act. In April 2018, the Mental Health Commission engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service. The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission has also received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff for the Decision Support Service and also a number of staff to provide shared services for the Mental Health Commission and Decision Support Service. These staff are being recruited on a phased basis by the Mental Health Commission.  </p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority is currently finalising its work on the suite of draft codes of practice in relation to non-healthcare matters which are required to be prepared under section 103 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  </p>  <p>  In June 2018, my Department recruited an external legal expert to assist in the preparation of draft regulations in relation to decision-making assistance agreements, co-decision-making agreements, certain matters relating to decision-making representatives, and enduring powers of attorney.  These regulation-making powers are provided for in sections 10(4), 31, 45(3), 45(4), 46(3) and 79 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. Work on the draft regulations is on-going.</p></reply>

Understanding the experience of such victims is important to me as Minister and greatly assists in the development of Government policy in this important area.  And my Department will study the report carefully in that context. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Government has already brought forward a range of new laws in recent years in order to help address domestic violence, as part of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021.</p>  <p>  Central to this is the landmark Domestic Violence Act 2018, which came into force on 1 January of this year.  Other developments in this area include the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which introduced a statutory definition of consent, and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which provides a wide range of measures to protect and inform victims during the progress of their case through the Criminal Justice system.</p>  <p>  In addition, on International Women&rsquo;s Day, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Istanbul Convention (the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence). </p>  <p>  Further, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuously improving its specialist services. Responding to the needs of victims has seen the rolling out by the Garda Commissioner of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs) with specially trained officers responsible for engagement with and interviewing of victims. These Units will support the delivery of a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of sexual and domestic crime.  </p>  <p>  I note that the report referred to also referred to sentencing in this field.  I would point out that the judiciary is independent in matters of sentencing. However the Judicial Council Act 2019 will provide for the development of sentencing guidelines by the judiciary themselves. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-01a.668.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100100070#WRM04400"><p>The Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB) is the national body with responsibility for the accreditation of laboratories, certification bodies and inspection bodies. INAB was established in 1985. The functions of INAB include the provision of accreditation in accordance with the relevant International Organisation for Standardisation ISO 17000 series of standards and guides.</p>  <p>  INAB is the sole national accreditation body for Ireland as appointed under EU Regulation 765/2008. The provision of the accreditation service for Irish enterprises is managed by the INAB executive and over seen by the INAB Board with the support of externally contracted expertise. INAB acts independently in carrying out its accreditation roles.</p>  <p>  Following the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s in June 2014 INAB became a committee of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA). </p>  <p>  The primary nature of contact between Departmental officials and INAB officials is related to the appointment of Notified Bodies. My Department is the Notifying Authority for the conformity assessment of certain products being placed on the EU internal market. If a Conformity Assessment Body applies to my Department to be appointed as a Notified Body under certain EU Directives (see attached at Appendix 1) then the Department seeks confirmation from INAB officials that the Conformity Assessment Body has received accreditation from INAB. This arises only in relation to accreditation provided by INAB to a Conformity Assessment Body under a specific number of EU Directives and it is in this context that my Department would seek information from INAB on individual accreditations. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the Department has no role in relation to decisions made by INAB as to who should be accredited and/or how the accreditation process should be conducted by INAB as INAB carries out this role independently. </p>  <p>  In addition, officials from my Department have been in regular contact with INAB officials for the last few years in relation to matters concerning accreditation processes in the context of Brexit. INAB officials have participated in a number of publicity events organised by my Department, and other Departments, in order to highlight the potential impact of Brexit on Irish businesses who currently use UK based accreditation services.</p>  <p>  Other interactions between officials from my Departments concerning INAB include interaction with the HSA on the financing and staffing of INAB in the context of the overall operational management and staffing of the HSA. </p>  <p>  INAB is also a member of the Market Surveillance Forum, an inter-Departmental/Agency forum, chaired by my Department, involving all the Market Surveillance Authorities within the State in addition to other relevant stakeholders, this forum meets on a quarterly basis. </p>  <p>  Given the above the Deputy will appreciate it is not possible to account for each individual exchange of correspondence for the period requested by the Deputy in this reply.</p>  <p>  However, if the Deputy has a particular topic in mind, my Department will be pleased to assist him. </p></reply>

I am consistently engaging and listening to the needs of start-ups and established small businesses. </p><p>I am keenly aware of their importance as SMEs account for 99.8% of all enterprises in the State and are predominantly indigenous. My Department through its Agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), provides a range of tailored supports to small and medium enterprises. Supports include access to finance, management development, mentoring supports, business development programmes, market supports and trade promotion. </p><p>Ireland continues to be very supportive of entrepreneurial activity and once again ranks 1<sup>st</sup>in Europe in terms of our entrepreneurs being held in high esteem. The 2018 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor annual index of early stage entrepreneurs indicates that Ireland had increased rates of entrepreneurship in 2018 and holds a position of 5<sup>th</sup>in Europe compared to 6<sup>th</sup>in 2017. Importantly, also reported is that the gap between male and female entrepreneurs has continued to narrow from a previous 2 to 1 ratio to a ratio of 1.6 to 1 in 2018. </p><p>While Ireland has a healthy and positive perception of entrepreneurship, I am cognisant of the need to create and support an environment where our budding entrepreneurs can thrive and succeed. </p><p>That is why in the 2019 Budget I allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;5m to the Local Enterprise Offices.  This extra funding assists our Agencies to reach more of our entrepreneurs and SMEs to help grow and scale their businesses which are at the heart of our economic growth. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s High Potential Start-Up (HPSU) team provides support and advice to entrepreneurs and early stage companies that have an innovative product, service or technology, and the potential to export.</p><p>The 31 LEOs are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other non-financial supports for anyone intending to start or grow their own business. The LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p><p>My Department also runs the www.supportingsmes.gov.ie online portal that enables start-ups and small business to navigate the supports available from all the different government departments, agencies and initiatives. This online tool also advertises upcoming events that would be of interest to entrepreneurs and established SME&rsquo;s such as financial literacy classes or business management workshops. </p><p>To further my commitment to the future growth of our indigenous small and medium enterprises, I commissioned the OECD Review of SME Policies in Ireland in March 2018. </p><p>The aim of the review is to provide tailored analysis and recommendations to my Department and the Irish government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies based on international comparisons. </p><p>This is a collaborative body of work and involves considerable input from Government departments, agencies, representative groups and most importantly, indigenous businesses themselves. This review is currently nearing completion and will be launched with an accompanying SME Strategy Roadmap by myself and the OECD Deputy Secretary General Knudsen on the 23<sup>rd</sup>October 2019. This will assist my Department in developing a SME Strategy which will be part of the Future Jobs Framework. </p><p>I and my Department will continue to hold structured dialogue with key stakeholders and advocate across Government to ensure the needs of SMEs and entrepreneurs are considered in the execution of national policy. </p></reply>

Through the mechanism of the Technical Working Group, Ireland has fully utilised the provisions of the State aid framework to enable the investment by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;74 million in 2018  in Brexit impacted businesses.   Earlier this year, following intense engagement by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, approval was received to provide capital support to Carbery Food Ingredients based in Cork towards financing a large diversification project to mitigate the impacts of Brexit, and further options are being developed to support large food companies.  The work of this Group is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I met with Commissioner Vestager.  The focus of the meeting centred around the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.   It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner's team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implication become known.  I have received assurances from the Commissioner that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p>  <p>  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State aid rules, this will be raised as part of these Working Group discussions.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Furthermore, many of the newer products being licensed are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. These include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost, the potential or actual budget impact, and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The process for assessing applications works very well where the new medicines have strong evidence of clinical effectiveness and are priced in a cost-effective manner.  Delays in reimbursement decisions for new products do occur in cases where the evidence of clinical effectiveness is weak, and where prices are set well outside of cost effectiveness parameters.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis, it must ensure that the best price is achieved. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 29 new medicines and 5 new uses of existing medicines representing a significant investment by the HSE to provide access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients.  It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next five years.  </p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists. </p>  <p>  Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for Government. In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve access for patients waiting for scheduled care this year.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The HSE advises that this is because there is no evidence that screening would be of any benefit to them. At this stage in life, normal cell changes in the cervix can look very like abnormal cells. If CervicalCheck tested women under 25, changes that are normal might be treated as abnormal and a woman could be sent for treatment when they don't need it. Invasive cervical cancer is also very rare at this age. The HSE advises any woman under 25 who is worried about their risk of developing cervical cancer to speak to their GP. </p>  <p>  This approach is in line with screening programmes in other countries. The UK National Screening Committee recommended in November 2012 that the age of first invitation for cervical screening should be raised to 25 in Wales and Scotland on the basis that there is evidence of a large number of women screened and treated with relatively little benefit below this age. </p>  <p>  Cancer screening is one important aspect of cancer prevention, and another is vaccination. The HPV vaccine protects against the HPV virus which can cause cancer and genital warts in both women and men, and has been offered to girls in their first year of secondary school since 2010. The Deputy may wish to know that, following a positive recommendation from HIQA, that an extension of the HPV vaccination programme to boys would be both clinically and cost effective, as of September this year HPV vaccination is now available to boys in first year of secondary school also.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy,  with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and  the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism  so that existing and potential investors can  make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that  there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs were considered in detail. It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly. </p>  <p>  The NTPF has now completed its report and the Steering Group has completed its consideration of it, the report was recently submitted by the NTPF to the Department. It is now being reviewed by Department officials and any recommendations included in the report will be appraised before publication.</p></reply>

The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in July last, my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development announced CL&Aacute;R funding of &euro;890,632 to 20 voluntary community organisations. This funding will support the purchase and/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues. It will support voluntary organisations that provide:</p>  <p>  - transport for people with significant mobility issues, including those requiring specialised  wheelchair accessible vehicles, to day-care or other medical, therapeutic or respite services; or</p>  <p>  - transport to/from designated cancer treatment hospitals/centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.</p></reply>

The objective of audit and quality review at CervicalCheck was to facilitate continued improvement and ongoing learning within the programme. Following the issues which arose in relation to the non-disclosure of audit findings, a decision was taken to pause the audit. </p>  <p>  The Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Gabriel Scally made a number of recommendations, one of which was that &ldquo;Audit should continue to be an important component of cervical screening as this complies with all good clinical practice. Common, robust and externally validated approaches to the design, conduct, evaluation and oversight of audits should be developed across the screening services.&rdquo; (Recommendation 26).</p>  <p>  As set out in the approved plan for the implementation of Dr Scally's recommendations, the HSE established an Expert Group within the National Screening Service (NSS) to review the clinical audit processes for interval cancers across all screening programmes. This work is ongoing and is expected to be complete by the end of this year, following which its recommendations will be implemented by the National Screening Service.</p></reply>

This principle applies to all consumers who are ordinarily resident in the country (here for a period of more than one year) as is set out in health insurance legislation.</p>  <p>  In the case of non-EEA students wishing to secure a visa to stay and study in Ireland, one of the requirements set down by the Department of Justice (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service), is that these students have health insurance for the period of their stay, so that they may not be a burden on the Irish public health system.</p>  <p>  Within this particular cohort there are those who are resident here for more than one year and therefore the community rating principle applies when they buy their insurance policies in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The High Court last year upheld the issuance by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) of an enforcement notice to an insurer, instructing this insurer to cease selling non-community rated policies to non-EEA students resident in the country for more than one year. </p>  <p>  If non-EEA students who are resident here for more than one year wish to purchase health insurance in Ireland, they may purchase community rated products from other companies that are registered with the HIA. Each of the three open membership insurers (Irish Life Health, Laya Healthcare and Vhi) have starter plans which offer coverage in most public hospitals and range in price from &euro;480-500 per annum. Insurers also offer young adult rates on many of their products, which further reduces the premium for young people availing of health insurance. The rates range from 50% of adult premium for someone aged 18, up to full adult premium for a 26 year old person.</p>  <p>  All health insurance policies sold in Ireland must also include a set of minimum benefits. These benefits are called the Minimum Benefit Regulations and are set out in health insurance legislation. They include a cohort of procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population. Coverage for repatriation is not included in these regulations and therefore health insurance policies sold in Ireland do not need to provide cover for this circumstance.</p></reply>

Following the assessment and after a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, the HSE notified the applicant in February 2019 that it was minded to not approve reimbursement for this indication.  The 2013 Act provides for a period of representations after such notifications, before the HSE can make its final decision.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2019, the NHSS is expected to support 23,042 people in 2019. The NHSS budget for 2019 is &euro;985.8m which is an increase of &euro;24.3m over its 2018 budget. </p>  <p>  Over the last two years, an additional &euro;45 million has been provided to NHSS budget for the continued provision of services in line with pricing and demand. As part of normal governance and performance management arrangements The Department and the HSE maintain regular service area engagements, which also form part of ongoing collaborative work on issues relating to older persons policy and service delivery.  </p>  <p>  The HSE have noted that the number of residents in nursing homes whom are supported by the NHSS to be ahead of forecast for the year to date. The latest available HSE data indicate that there are 23,090 people supported in the Scheme at the end of August this year. This is significantly more people than forecast and this creates a challenge. The HSE has also advised that the cost of care continues to rise and the average weekly cost per bed is higher in 2019 than anticipated. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the available budget and the demand for support, the HSE releases funding in a managed way to ensure that the operation of the NHSS remains within the budgetary allocation. The HSE cannot legally fund clients beyond the determined funding allocation, and the appropriate mechanism relating to funding allocations is through the estimates and budgetary process. To manage the available funds throughout the year, a national placement list for the release of funding is operated by the HSE, to enable it to operate within budget. Funding issues to applicants in chronological order, to ensure equity nationally. Approved applicants are placed on the national placement list in order of their approval date and funding is released to applicants in order of their place on this list. The length of time spent on the placement list depends on the number of applicants currently receiving financial support and the number of new applications. Where demand is higher, the time spent on the waiting list may increase having regard for the prudent management of the Scheme's budget.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has put in place arrangements that a monthly analysis of performance of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme continues to ensure that the maximum number of new entrants are approved with the shortest possible waiting times while remaining on track to deliver a balanced budgetary position by year end. In the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current high-level of delayed transfers of care (DTOCs). However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS this month bringing the waiting time for the release of funding back to 4 weeks.  </p>  <p>  As of 25 September I can confirm that 572 applicants to the Scheme are waiting for funding to be released.</p></reply>

care interventions.  It is also one of the most effective ways a parent can protect the health of their child.  The childhood immunisation programme in Ireland has had a huge impact in improving the health of the Irish people.  Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world such as polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough and many other serious infectious diseases are now preventable by vaccination.  However, due to misinformation vaccination rates are not as high as they should be. </p>  <p>One of my priorities as Minister for Health is to increase vaccination rates across the country and I am exploring several options in this regard.  I launched the Vaccine Alliance on the 10   September whose aim is to increase uptake rates of childhood vaccines and reduce vaccine hesitancy.  The group includes a wide range of organisations and further organisations will be added once the terms of reference, key target audiences, and priorities for the Vaccine Alliance have been agreed.  It is important to note that vaccine hesitancy is not unique to Ireland.  It is a global issue and has been identified by the World Health Organisation as one of the ten leading threats to global health in 2019.</p>  <p>  As you are aware the immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in several specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.  </p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions to.  All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the EMA's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities.  </p>  <p>  I am informed that as all vaccines used in Ireland&rsquo;s immunisation programmes have been approved for use in the European Union by the EMA there is no requirement for indemnity to be provided to vaccine manufacturers.</p>  <p>  Aluminium has been used in vaccines for many decades to improve the body's response to vaccination.  It is a component of the HPV vaccine Gardasil and several other vaccines.  The World Health Organisation's (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine safety (an expert clinical and scientific advisory body) has concluded that there is no evidence of a health risk from aluminium-containing vaccines. </p>  <p>  I am also informed by the HPRA that there is no thiomersal in any of the vaccines used in the childhood immunisation programme in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by the HPRA that at present there are three types of vaccine strains authorised in IE which are manufactured in cell lines which were originally derived from foetal tissue.  The Rubella vaccine strain is produced in the Wistar RA 27/3 cell line while the hepatitis A and varicella vaccine strains are expressed in the MRC-5 human diploid cell line.  No new foetal tissue has been used in the manufacture of either rubella, hepatitis A or varicella antigens since the development of the original cell lines.  Following production, the vaccines are purified from the cell line expression system and the purity of the vaccine formulation has to be demonstrated in line with regulatory standards.  This includes limiting process-related impurities derived from the manufacturing process i.e. the cell expression system (e.g. host cell proteins, host cell DNA).  The WHO has concluded that levels of up to 10 ng of residual host cell DNA can be considered as acceptable.</p>  <p>  Prior to use in humans all vaccine formulations undergo preclinical testing.  These typically involve a range of in vitro tests followed by a comprehensive range of toxicity studies in animals.  These studies identify potential safety concerns and serve to avoid possible harm to human subjects.  Clinical safety studies are conducted during the clinical trials and the safety data that is collected is based on events reported after each dose of vaccine and also events reported after a longer time post-vaccination.  Clinical trials run for a defined period and safety data will be collected from trial participants for a defined period post vaccination.  This period of time may differ between trials.  In addition, vaccines on the market are continuously monitored to provide additional safety data and to identify adverse reactions.  Under the regulatory framework, benefit-risk evaluations continue to be carried out throughout the product lifecycle.</p>  <p>  Manufacture of vaccines must also comply with good manufacturing standards and regulatory requirements in EU and national legislation to ensure that the materials and methods used are appropriate.  Vaccine manufactures are subject to independent assessment and inspection by national medicines agencies.  It is important to reiterate that all medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.  The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.</p></reply>

As a result clinical assessment and the design of care plans need to be tailored to the individual patient. There are assessments and tests which can be carried out in primary care settings by a General Practitioner. Specialised tests may be required when considering and ruling out other diagnoses.  Relevant specialists are usually accessed through out patient clinics at secondary care level.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. </p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p>  - Nursing and  personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p>  <p>  - Bed and board;</p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p>  <p>  - Laundry  service.</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers, hairdressing or transport just as they would if they were being cared for at home. Transport to and from medical appointments is not covered under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  As transport is not included in the agreed price with private nursing homes and as there is no statutory requirement for the HSE to provide transport, a nursing home resident or their representative is responsible for costs incurred in conveying the resident to hospital appointments.  Where a private nursing home provides a transport service to residents, details of this service and associated costs should be included in the written agreement between the resident or their representative and the nursing home.  </p>  <p>  Whilst there is no statutory requirement for the HSE to provide transport, a limited service is available with priority given to persons receiving cancer treatment and dialysis.  In exceptional circumstances the HSE can arrange for persons to attend critical clinical appointments if the family or the individual are unable to provide it independently.  In such cases transport is arranged on the basis that it is shared between patients to ensure that the maximum number benefit.  A referral to avail of this service must be made by the local public health nurse, registered general nurse or the person&rsquo;s General Practitioner.</p></reply>

The Strategy&rsquo;s key aims are to improve sexual health and wellbeing and to reduce negative sexual health outcomes.  A mid-term review of the Strategy, conducted in 2018, found that implementation is going well and that the Strategy will remain relevant beyond 2020. </p>  <p>  Consequently, the vision for the strategy, priorities and actions post 2020 will be reviewed to ensure the programme evolves in line with the changes to the external environment and the opportunities these may bring.  A refreshed version of the strategy will be developed in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Ancillary Recommendations of the Committee on the 8th Amendment to the Constitution are a key implementation priority. Funding of &euro;500,000 has been provided to the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme to support implementation of the Recommendations.  Measures include the expansion of condom provision, actions related to education and training, work arising from recommendations of the NCCA review of Relationship and Sexuality Education, communications campaigns, the MyOptions support service for those facing unplanned pregnancy, and development of a general population survey on sexual health. </p>  <p>  A Working Group has been established within the Department of Health to examine the various policy, regulatory and legislative issues arising in relation to improving access to contraception. The Group has recently held a public consultation exercise and has engaged directly with numerous stakeholders.  It is currently preparing a report which I expect to receive shortly.     </p>  <p>  A policy review of sexual assault treatment units (SATUs) has recently been conducted, which has put forward a number of practical actions to enhance and strengthen the Health response to victims of sexual violence.</p>  <p>  One of the Review's actions is to communicate the role and support available through SATUs more routinely and effectively. The HSE is currently working on a SATU specific communications project - one aspect of which will be to improve knowledge and education about SATU services among, clinicians across the health service, and wider society.</p>  <p>   A sub-Committee of the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG) Strategy Committee has been established to examine issues around period poverty. The sub-Committee is chaired by my Department and includes representation from a number of Government Departments and NGOs, including the National Women's Council of Ireland. The first meeting of the sub-Committee took place on September 6.</p></reply>

The Capacity Programme for 2019 provides for the following increases in capacity, as set out in the National Service Plan 2019:</p>  <p>  - The provision of 75 acute beds and 70 community beds under the Winter Plan 2018/19 &ndash; the HSE has confirmed that all the acute beds and 59 community beds have opened to date. </p>  <p>  - 47 additional beds, including the 40-bed modular build in South  Tipperary General Hospital (STGH), 3 HDU beds in the Mater Hospital and 4 HDU beds in Cork University Hospital. </p>  <p>  - preparation of 202 beds, of which 16 are critical care, during 2019, with a view to bringing this extra capacity into operation in the first quarter of 2020.  </p>  <p>  - Commencement of works on a 60-bed modular ward in University Hospital Limerick. </p>  <p>  Improving timely access for patients is at the heart of Sl&aacute;intecare. Building upon the progress made in recent years in this area, the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019 published by the Department, includes a specific work stream on Access and Waiting Lists. In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in the Action Plan will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years. Progress has already been made in implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan&rsquo;s Access actions this year.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of thalidomide.</p><p>Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p><p>There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, I wish to inform the Deputy that the LTI Scheme will be included as part of a review of the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p><p>For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p><p>Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;124 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p><p>1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p><p>2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p><p>This report was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. </p><p>The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p><p>The Report makes 19 recommendations including:</p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials;</p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;</p><p>- the development of clinical guidance;</p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;</p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and</p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.</p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. </p><p>The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July 2018 to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.</p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group was convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations which included three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. </p><p>I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed by the HSE. This work includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. </p><p>Pending the completion of this work, the HSE is also examining options to address service requirements for patients with immediate or urgent needs. </p><p>As was requested by the Secretary General of my Department in November 2018, the HSE has prepared an Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, which was approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website on 26 April 2019, which I hope provides further clarity on this issue.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE has advised that a detailed progress report on implementation of the recommendations will be provided to my Department and this report is awaited. </p><p>The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. </p><p>I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.</p><p>At my meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence. It is my intention to meet again with the Mesh Survivors Ireland group in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

There are many reasons for this, such as a patient undertaking the application process for NHSS, awaiting assessment for a home care package, homelessness, ward of court application, and the availability of resources.</p>  <p>  In many cases, the HSE will use transitional care to accommodate the patient during the period between discharge, and the  finalisation of the new care arrangements, but can often be a delay, especially in cases where the patient and family are coming to terms with the new circumstances.</p>  <p>  The HSE seeks to balance patient experience with the need to keep DTOCs as low as possible.</p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply and we have seen increases in delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support and in response, and in the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current the high-level of DTOCs. However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS this month, bringing the waiting time for the release of funding back to 4 weeks, and provided additional home care and transitional care beds.</p>  <p>  Separately, following the 2019 publication of the Independent Expert Review of Delayed Discharges, an implementation group has been established to progress the recommendations.  Minister Daly has also established a Cross Divisional Oversight Group within the Department of Health to oversee the HSE&rsquo;s implementation of the recommendations. </p>  <p>  As regards those persons discharged and awaiting new care arrangements for over 6 months, the Department does not have specific details on these individuals, but generally these cases are complex, and include issues such as homelessness, legal issues (such as ward of court) and the requirement for modifications to be undertaken at the patients home before they can leave hospital. </p>  <p>  The Department will seek further information and provide a further response directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

An applicant to the scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home. The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.</p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:</p>  <p>  - Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;</p>  <p>  - An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;</p>  <p>  - If an applicant has a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  - If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p>  <p>  - Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;</p>  <p>  - A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  Income from public, private or State pensions are treated in the same manner as other sources of income having regard for the fact that the Scheme is a financial support scheme with the level of State support provided dependent on the financial means of the applicant. There are no plans to make changes to how pensions are assessed under the NHSS.</p></reply>

My Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the NHSS was approved by Government on the 11th June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. I intend to progress this as quickly as possible, however, the timeline for completion of the legislation will also depend on how it passes through the Houses.

This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports already totalling 247,000 up until week commencing the 9th September.

We are awaiting the Algerian authorities&rsquo; imprimatur prior to the commencement of the revised trade conditions.</p>  <p>  In relation to Turkey, my Department hosted a visit in May by a technical team that included officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and ESK (the Turkish Meat and Milk Board). </p>  <p>  A successful live export trade relies on the cooperation of a multitude of stakeholders. Therefore, the recent establishment of the Irish Livestock Exporters' Association is to be welcomed.   This body can represent the industry&rsquo;s views, not just to my Department, but also to ferry companies, port authorities, lairage operators and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  At its request, I met the new Association last week to discuss a number of industry concerns, including lairage capacity.  I briefed the representative body on the progress made by my Department to source new markets as outlined above and I look forward to further engagement with the group in the future. </p></reply>

It is not possible to change the terms and conditions of the scheme, which was notified to the Commission at the end of July, as required under the Exceptional Aid implementing regulation.</p>  <p>  This year, I also introduced the exchequer-funded Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million scheme which will provide suckler farmers with valuable data on the weaning efficiency of their animals.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020.

This was identified as the necessary contribution from the Built Environment to Ireland's overall emissions reduction targets for 2030. Achieving our 2050 ambition will require a further step up and many more houses will have to be retrofitted in the decades to come. The level of retrofit required for each home will depend on the starting point and current energy performance in that home.    I recently announced the establishment of a Taskforce that will drive the achievement of this target. The Taskforce will oversee the development of a new national delivery model, which will group homes together, create easy pay back mechanisms and develop smart financing options. Development of the new model will be informed by the experience from existing schemes in Ireland as well as best practice in other jurisdictions.

In particular, the Climate Action Plan sets out the necessary actions to: </p><p>- Put 180,000 electric vehicles on our roads by 2025 and almost 1m by 2030 </p><p>- Ensure the EV charging network underpins public confidence </p><p>- Create an early public procurement framework for EVs </p><p>- Accelerate steps to decarbonise the public transport fleet </p><p>- Establish a Cycling Project Office, develop a 5 year cycling strategy and roll out 200km of new cycle lanes through bus connects </p><p>- A new Park and Ride Strategy to be developed, to reduce congestion and lower journey times </p><p>- Develop a regulatory framework on low emission zones and parking pricing policies, and provide local authorities with the power to restrict access to certain parts of a city or a town to zero emission vehicles only </p><p>- No new fossil fuel vehicles sold from 2030</p><p>Currently 40% of homes use coal and peat to heat their homes (many in combination with other fossil fuel heating systems). By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps. Currently over 99% of our vehicle fleet is fuelled by fossil fuels. By 2030, nearly a million fully electric or hybrid vehicles (35%-40%) will be on our roads. These measures will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions of harmful pollutants.</p><p>In relation to the Clean Air Strategy, it will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect across Government in a manner consistent with national priorities, EU and other international policy considerations. The Clean Air Strategy will address a range of harmful air pollutants in Ireland, including those arising from the agricultural, transport and residential heating sectors, in an integrated manner. </p><p>Given the wide range of pollutant sources, it is important that action is coordinated across various sectors. In this regard, the Department consulted widely, including with other Departments, State Agencies, and industry bodies on the formulation of the Cleaning Our Air issues paper, which was itself the subject of a public consultation. In addition, a number of plans have been under development recently, including the National Air Pollution Control Programme, the National Energy and Climate Plan, and the Climate Action Plan, which are relevant to the clean air agenda. I am keen to ensure that synergies are maximised between these plans and the National Clean Air Strategy, with a view to achieving lasting reductions in the health and environmental impacts of air pollution. I am committed to publishing the National Clean Air Strategy at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

This was preceded on Saturday, 21 September, by Youth Climate Summit which was attended by myself and the Minister for Children.Ireland&rsquo;s national statement to the Climate Action Summit, delivered by the Taoiseach, confirmed that the Government would accept and act upon the advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council in relation to the future of oil and natural gas offshore exploration and recovery. In this regard, it was accepted that the exploration for, and the recovery of, new offshore oil reserves is not compatible with a low carbon transition, and that the exploration for, and extraction of new offshore gas reserves can be consistent with this transition. I will shortly bring proposals to Government to set out the next steps in terms of how this advice is to be implemented.</p><p>Ireland also announced that all new revenue raised from carbon tax will be ring-fenced to fund new climate action and the just transition. This just transition will help to protect those most exposed to higher fuel and energy costs and for whom new jobs must be found to shift from carbon-intensive industries. Specific decisions on how additional carbon tax revenue will be used are a matter for the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the Budget process.</p><p>As part of the preparation for the summit on Youth Engagement and Public Mobilisation, Ireland and the Marshall Irelands jointly sponsored the preparation of the 'Kwon Gesh' (or &quot;Solemn Duty&quot;) climate pledge, which invites its signatories to give the younger generation a greater voice in creating climate policy. </p><p>Parties to the summit were invited to make new commitments under a number of different themes, include mitigation strategy; resilience and adaptation; climate finance and carbon pricing; social and political drivers; energy transition; resilience and adaptation; nature-based solutions; infrastructure, cities and local government; industry; and youth engagement and public mobilisation. Ireland has confirmed support for a number of initiatives under different themes as set out below.</p><p>1. Mitigation Strategy Coalition</p><p>Ireland was included on a list of countries and non-Party stakeholders that demonstrated genuine leadership either by having developed plans to achieve net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, by having identified this target as a long-term national goal or by advancing consultations on a long-term strategy for climate-neutrality in line with the Paris Agreement. </p><p>2.

Furthermore, 74% of managed municipal waste was recovered in 2016 (compared to 59% in 2012). Significantly more residual waste is now used as a fuel (energy recovery) than disposed to landfill. Further information is available at </p><p>New waste management targets agreed by the European Council include a provision that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2035 the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10% or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight). Furthermore, recycling rates of 55%, 60% and 65% of municipal waste (by weight) must be achieved by 2025, 2030 and 2035 respectively. </p><p>The continued implementation of European, national and regional waste management policy to manage waste in line with the waste hierarchy will help ensure that Ireland is well placed to meet these new targets.</p><p>A review of &quot;<i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i>&quot; was initiated earlier this year. This review process will take account of a number of initiatives, such as the European Circular Economy waste and plastics legislation framework and the reports from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Price Monitoring Group. This process will inform the development of future national waste management policy, including our environmental goals, regulatory and market structures, and relevant policy instruments and tools. </p></reply>

The Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department. As Minister I have no function in relation to individual applications.These upgrades are provided free of charge to the homeowner. As stated in response to Parliamentary Question number 1497 of 2019, in order to be eligible to receive works under the scheme, an applicant&rsquo;s property must have been built and occupied before 2006. This rule is in place on the basis that these properties should have been constructed to the 2003 Building Regulations and so should not require significant insulation or heating system upgrades. SEAI link this to the date of the electricity meter being installed, as it is unlikely that a property is completed and occupied before that date. </p><p>The SEAI have examined the details for this application and Electric Ireland have confirmed that the electricity meter was not connected until March 2006. The scheme rules must be applied consistently to all applications to ensure fairness as well as value for money for the Exchequer. Therefore the SEAI are not proceeding with this application. </p><p>SEAI operate under a Customer Charter and a complaints and appeals procedure is in place. If after following this procedure an applicant is not satisfied with the outcome, they can ask the Office of the Ombudsman for an independent review of the complaint.

By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps. Currently over 99% of our vehicle fleet is fuelled by fossil fuels. By 2030, nearly a million fully electric or hybrid vehicles (35%-40%) will be on our roads. These measures will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions of harmful pollutants.</p>  <p>  Extending the ban on the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality, particularly in built up areas. </p>  <p>  The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to our major cities. </p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. </p>  <p>  Regarding the proposed national extension of the smoky coal ban, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban. </p>  <p>  This is particularly disappointing, given the impact poor air quality can have on human health and the environment and the emphasis the government is putting on transitioning to a low carbon society.</p>  <p>  The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without a nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because these products produce similar levels of pollution. The legal threat is not only to take down any new nationwide ban, but to remove the existing ban which is in currently in place in cities and many towns around the country. </p>  <p>  The Attorney General has provided legal advice on this matter. I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan, which will improve air quality by reducing air pollution, without jeopardizing the existing ban. </p>  <p>  I also intend to publish a Clean Air Strategy, which will set out a number of policies to improve air quality nationwide in the coming months. </p>  <p>  My Department is also funding the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s roll-out of the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), which will greatly improve the data available on air pollution in Ireland, facilitating the design and targeting of appropriate policy measures to tackle it. </p></reply>

The scheme was intended to run for 3 years and closed for applications on 19th July in line with the published Application Guidelines.  The scheme is funded by my Department and operated by the SEAI. The Pilot provides 50% funding for energy upgrades to an A BER rating with 95% funding provided for low-income households. The total budget for the scheme this year is &euro;10 million &ndash; double the amount spent on the scheme last year. The SEAI have informed me that 6 letters of offer have issued to successful applicants in September and that evaluation of the remaining project applications is on-going. &euro;1.99 million has been paid in grants under the scheme in 2019.</p>  <p>  While the Deep Retrofit Pilot is now closed to new applications, a number of other grants for energy efficiency works remain available. Further information on the grants available from SEAI can be found on their website. Since 2000, over 400,000 homeowners have received direct support under these schemes to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. This year &euro;100m has been allocated to these schemes.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan commits to reviewing and redesigning the existing grant schemes to ensure alignment with Government climate objectives and value for money. The Plan also sets an ambitious target of 500,000 energy efficiency retrofits by 2030. Achievement of this target will be supported by the Project Ireland 2040 allocation of &euro;3.7 billion as well as the range of measures identified in the Plan.</p>  <p>  I recently announced the establishment of a Taskforce that will drive the achievement of this target. The Taskforce will oversee the development of a new national delivery model, which will group homes together, create easy pay back mechanisms and find smart financing. Development of the new model will be informed by the experience from existing schemes in Ireland as well as best practice in other jurisdictions. The first meeting of the Taskforce took place on 30 September.</p></reply>

For example, SEAI estimate the cost of charging an electric vehicle to travel 400km is circa &euro;7.30, compared to &euro;40.80 to fill an equivalent petrol car to cover the same distance. The roll-out of the National Smart Energy Metering programme will also allow domestic electricity consumers to make further savings by choosing a tariff and charging their electric vehicles when electricity prices are at their lowest. The price of electricity, whether via existing meters or smart meters, is a matter for electricity suppliers. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan, which sets a target of 936,000 electric vehicles on the road in Ireland by 2030, sets out a range of actions to support the uptake of electric vehicles which includes: </p><p>- introducing a capital support that will be provided to Local Authorities for the development of on-street public chargers; </p><p>- commencing the ESB Electric Vehicle High Power Charging Infrastructure Development Project, supported by the Climate Action Fund; </p><p>- expanding the Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant to include shared parking (e.g. in apartment blocks); and </p><p>- introducing legislation to ban the sale of new fossil fuel cars from 2030.</p><p>There is a wide range of supports already available to support the uptake of electric vehicles including purchase grants, tax relief and discounted tolls.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-01a.1205.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100100079#WRV04700"><p>Climate considerations have been placed at the heart of Government&rsquo;s policy-making and decision-making processes.  The Climate Action Plan clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption. The transport sector, which accounts for a fifth of Ireland's greenhouse emissions annually and which has a heavy reliance on fossil fuel usage, has an important role to play in this national decarbonisation effort. </p>  <p>  The movement of goods by road is the second biggest source of transport emissions after private car use. According to the most recent emissions inventory, heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) alone contributed over 18% of Ireland's total land transport emissions in 2017. Clearly, emissions from the freight sector are difficult to address &ndash; HDVs account for only around 5% of vehicles on EU roads but they are responsible for some 25% of all EU road transport emissions. Without significant policy action, their emissions trajectory is projected to continue to rise by almost a fifth between 2010 and 2050.  This trajectory may be even steeper in Ireland where there has been a steady annual increase in road freight activity levels and the number of additional new goods vehicles being licensed in recent years.  Accordingly, developing measures to help address emissions from this sector is critical. </p>  <p>  The quickest way to avoid freight emissions is to streamline operations and ensure that vehicle loads and journey routes are optimised.  Freight companies are adept at optimising logistical operations and these practices should be encouraged to continue. In tandem, using the most efficient and lowest emitting vehicles is also essential in limiting freight emissions. For this reason, Ireland was very supportive of the introduction of new EU Regulations that set maximum fleet emission averages for new HDVs. New vehicles must emit 15% and 30% less CO2  by 2025 and 2030 respectively relative to average emissions over the period July 2019 to June 2020.  Similar legislation has proved to be a very effective approach in other jurisdictions (e.g. Japan, the USA and Canada) and has already been demonstrated to deliver marked emission reductions with cars/vans in Europe.  </p>  <p>  As well as making the vehicles more efficient, lower emitting fuels must be employed. Although the Euro VI standard for HDVs represents a considerable improvement over older and more polluting Euro standards, for climate and air quality reasons Ireland must begin to move beyond the use of fossil fuels.  A range of new alternative fuel solutions are emerging across the fleet spectrum. The Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce recently concluded its deliberations on the potential role of alternative fuels, including compressed natural gas (CNG) as a pathway to biomethane, biofuels, and hydrogen in the freight sector. The Taskforce has made recommendations to help accelerate the uptake of alternative fuels and technologies, which are being presented to the Government in advance of Budget 2020.  This is especially important as new vehicles entering the fleet over the coming years will likely remain in the fleet for most or all of the coming decade.   </p>  <p>  At present there are a number of incentives in place to encourage the uptake of lower emitting alternatives, namely:</p>  <p>  - a low excise rate for natural gas and biogas for a period of eight years,</p>  <p>  - an accelerated capital allowance scheme for gas-propelled vehicles and related equipment,  and</p>  <p>  - support for the roll-out of refuelling infrastructure for alternative fuels and technologies.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is supporting a range of research into decarbonising the freight sector.  Two freight projects are also approved for funding under the Climate Action Fund.</p>  <p>  We are focusing our finite resources on supporting the uptake of new lower emitting alternatives.  Furthermore, more energy, fuel and emissions efficient fossil fueled vehicles should have no purchase price premium and lower running costs for operators and, accordingly, should need no incentive from Government to support uptake.  Accordingly, I have no immediate plans to introduce a grant or capital allowance scheme to assist road haulage companies to buy new diesel vehicles.</p></reply>

My officials have also worked closely with the Road Safety Authority (RSA) in seeking to encourage holders of UK driver licences  who are resident in Ireland to exchange their UK licence for an Irish licence in advance of 31 October 2019.   Following a no deal Brexit, a UK driving licence will no longer be valid for persons living in Ireland. The RSA has run a number of media campaigns including a further radio campaign which commenced on 23 September 2019 to encourage those living in Ireland and holding UK (including NI) driving licences to exchange these in good time before 31 October. </p>  <p>  At the start of this process, it was estimated that some 70,000 UK licences were held by people resident in Ireland. Some 32,000 of these have been exchanged to date.  The RSA is adding extra hours to its opening hours in the NDLS Centres commencing on 7 October. The extra hours will be advertised on www.ndls.ie. Extra resources are also in place in the application processing centre to cater for the extra expected demand. At present, the average waiting time for the exchange of a UK driving licence for an Irish driving licence is 4 days. </p></reply>

This was achieved through bye-laws enacted under Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides a general power to a local authority to make bye-laws in relation to its own property or services or to regulate matters of local concern.  It is under this Act that local authorities can choose, using bye-laws, to regulate horse-drawn carriages that operate for hire or reward.  These bye-laws allow relevant local authorities to set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations.</p>  <p>  In 2018 DCC became aware that - specifically in relation to Dublin - this legal basis for making such bye-laws could be uncertain, as the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 had vested the power to regulate horse-drawn carriages in Dublin with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the successor. </p>  <p>  My Department examined this issue and, following legal advice, is now of the view that the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 remain in force and preclude DCC from enacting the relevant bye-laws.  Also, it seems that a simple repeal of the Victorian legislation alone may not be sufficient to enable DCC to enact bye-laws for horse-drawn carriages.  Therefore, my Department is now working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to identify how best to empower DCC to regulate this area.</p>  <p>  Animal Welfare issues are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. However, I note that the Control of Horses Act 1996 allows local authorities to introduce bye-laws designating certain areas as control areas for horses. Dublin City Council has designated its administrative boundaries as such a control area under its Control of Horses Bye-Laws 2014. These bye-laws require horses to be licensed and set minimum standards for the keeping of horses within the control area.  </p>  <p>  Regulations for horse-drawn carriages for hire or reward should be aligned with any horse welfare obligations imposed by local authorities. Accordingly, I am of the view that horse-drawn carriages for hire and reward should be regulated by local authorities and not the National Transport Authority, which has neither competency for nor experience of animal welfare issues.  My Department&rsquo;s efforts are therefore centred on enabling Dublin City Council to regulate this area in Dublin just as other local authorities regulate this area elsewhere in the country. </p></reply>

In Budget 2019, I provided almost &euro;4 million in additional funding to Tourism Ireland for this purpose. China, as the largest source of outbound tourism in the world, is one of the main emerging markets we are targeting. </p>  <p>  While the resources allocated to any particular market is an operational matter for Tourism Ireland, I am aware that the additional funding I provided has allowed the agency to substantially increase its activity in the Chinese market this year. It has doubled its investment to &euro;1 million and increased its on the ground marketing team to 12, including a presence in Hong Kong. It has also increased its publicity, digital and social media activity in the market and continues to interact with the travel trade in the market.</p>  <p>  In order to make the most of the potential from a market such as China, it is important that the industry here is sufficiently prepared in order to be able to offer visitors a quality experience which meets their requirements. To this end, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working with Irish tourism businesses across the country to help them capitalise on this potential by training them in how to meet the specific needs of the Chinese visitor. Its Get China Ready programme was developed in partnership with Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland and is jointly delivered with the support of the Centre for Competitiveness, which is the licensed provider of China Outbound Tourism Research Institute programmes in Ireland. </p>  <p>  With the support of Government, the work being done by the tourism agencies both in China and here in Ireland, together with the industry, leaves us well placed to attract increased tourism from China in the coming years.</p></reply>

This is a significant development as the bus is by far the most important part of our public transport network. </p>  <p>  On the Luas network, the first of the extensions to the Luas Green Line fleet has entered service with the remaining 25 extensions set to enter service on a rolling basis from now on. Next year will also see delivery of the 8 additional trams that have been ordered as part of the Luas Green Line Capacity Enhancement Project. </p>  <p>  On rail while there have been improvements introduced last year in peak-time services, and this year in off-peak services, there are two fundamental constraints, namely the need to physically expand the fleet through the purchase of additional carriages and also the need to improve the overall management of the network. </p>  <p>  And I am pleased to say there is progress underway in relation to both.  In relation to the fleet, a business case for the purchase of 41 additional InterCity Railcars is currently under consideration by my Department in line with the Public Spending Code.  That business case will be submitted to Government for its approval and it is expected that the new fleet will be delivered by 2021. </p>  <p>  Separately, in May this year the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commenced pre-qualifying in relation to a 10-year procurement framework for electric and battery-electric units which will massively expand the fleet. </p>  <p>  In the summer, the Government approved the development of a new National Train Control Centre and contracts on this are expected to be awarded before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In the medium and longer term, the Deputy will acknowledge the on-going development of BusConnects, DART Expansion and MetroLink each of which will transform the capacity of the relevant public transport modes and create better linkages between them too. </p>  <p>  I would hope that the Deputy can see that there are a range of measures underway to improve our public transport network and services.  </p></reply>

It is not a State operated service. It is governed by its own Board. The service is currently experiencing significant financial difficulties. </p>  <p>  Leitrim County Childcare Committee, funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, has been working intensively to support the service to resolve legacy issues since March of this year. My Department, through Pobal's Case Management service, has also provided a range of supports and advice to the service.</p>  <p>  MCS's Board decided to close the service on Friday 20th September, despite the significant level of support that it had received. The Board indicated in their notification to parents that the closure was temporary, and that they would continue to seek a solution to the current situation. </p>  <p>  A funding request to Pobal and the DCYA for the service was in process at the time of their closure. It is important to note however that the stream of funding under discussion at that time was not a direct financial support for the service, and would therefore not have addressed the primary issue currently impacting the setting; a critical cash-flow challenge. </p>  <p>  Due to the importance of this service in ensuring sufficient childcare capacity in the area, officials in my Department are currently working closely with Pobal to fully explore all available options. The next step will be for Pobal to discuss a range of options with the service&rsquo;s Board of Management, at a meeting which I understand is scheduled to take place today (1 October 2019). It is hoped that the Board can agree a range of reforms necessary to bring the service to a sustainable footing that will best serve the children and families of the area, and, in so doing, to enable appropriate access to further supports from Pobal/DCYA.</p></reply>

The online system will offer a user friendly and effective system for parents, whilst offering greater efficiency in the administration and costs associated with the operation of a Government scheme. A secure identity verification system is required for any such IT system and the Public Services Card and MyGovID offers such security in the safeguarding of applicants' information and the administration of public funding.</p>  <p>  Following expert advice regarding the launch of the new Scheme, the online application process will be introduced first, followed shortly thereafter by the paper based application process. </p>  <p>  With regard to the report by the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) into the PSC, the Government and the Attorney General have carefully considered the findings of the report, including the legal basis for the use of the PSC by specified bodies or persons (such as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs).

Over 3.2 million of the population already have the card, many of whom it is believed are the parents of young children who may be interested in the subsidies available under the National Childcare Scheme. Those families already availing of current childcare schemes can remain on these until end of August 2020 and, as such, will not require the card.</p></reply>

For example, Child A and B qualify under Band A of the Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP) programme, if Child A attends childcare full time, their payment is &euro;145. If child B attends childcare on a half-sessional basis, their payment is &euro;22.50. Both children have the  same eligibility, but due to different levels of attendance, their payments vary substantially and the levels of service/attendance can change throughout the programme year dependant on circumstances. </p><p>The capitation for ECCE varies between &euro;69 and &euro;80 per week per child approximately.

Budget 2019 announced an increase to the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,500 per year. </p><p>There have also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016.

My Department has also provided capital funding every year to increase capacity in the sector.</p>  <p>  The figures presented in the question were provided in response to Parliamentary Question No. 227 and 228 of 19 September 2019. Currently, data on the impact of compliance visits are not recorded at the level of individual children; instead, this information is recorded on a service level and contract level. It is therefore not possible to provide an answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question relating to the overclaims identified to children registered . However, two important factors are important to note.</p>  <p>  Firstly, compliance visits should not result in children attending services and accessing subsidies being refused subsidies or services. The DCYA continues to pay services for children who are in attendance. In fact, the increased compliance may see the attendance of children increase. As stated earlier, twice as many children are being subsidised now as were subsidised 4-5 years ago. Twice as many childcare places exist, and the average childcare service has grown from 33 places in 2014 to 47 in 2019. I would also note that the new IT system built to support the National Childcare Scheme will facilitate a greater level of insight into changes in the sector and compliance outcomes. </p>  <p>  The rules of the Department&rsquo;s early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are very clear: subsidies are paid based on patterns of child attendance. That said, it should be emphasised that Pobal, when determining a pattern of attendance during a compliance visit, aim to apply the rules in a manner which maximises the subsidy available to the child.  </p>  <p>  The attendance rules of the new National Childcare Scheme will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a further degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work to support providers who deliver the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes. The increased investment in recent years should have assisted sustainability significantly. The &euro;19.4m annual Programme Support Payment recognises the additional time required of providers to complete the administrative work associated with childcare programmes funded by the Department. Compliance visits are critical to protect the Exchequer and ensure that finite resources for children and families are used to support as many children as possible. Any service which experiences financial difficulty following a compliance visit is encouraged to access available supports through Pobal's Case Management service and through their local City/County Childcare Committee to address.</p></reply>

This is a complex exercise given the scope and ambitious nature of many of the recommendations. Once this initial analysis and assessment is complete, my Department will further co-ordinate the responses received. It is my intention to review progress in this regard, and to convene an interdepartmental meeting with relevant Departments in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Regarding recommendations that fall within the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA), work has already commenced on the detailed scoping necessary to implement a number of the Forum's recommendations including the proposed commemoration, memorialisation, research on language and terminology measures and considerations relevant to the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, 2016.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Collaborative Forum's recommendations, my colleague the Minister for Health convened a working group to develop specific proposals for a package of health and well-being supports. My officials are participating in this work and I understand that there have been six meetings to date, with a final meeting being held this week. This process is intended to facilitate considerations within the estimates process for Budget 2020.</p></reply>

Services were initially registered via the statutory declaration process introduced in 2016. Registration cycles are prescribed by legislation for a period of three years. Three months prior to expiration, providers are required to renew their registration via application. Conditions apply to a cycle of registration and cannot automatically be carried over into a new registration cycle. It is incumbent upon the provider to comply with their conditions when applied so that they can be removed. Services will be assessed to determine compliance with conditions and it is policy to refer contravention of conditions to enforcement. </p><p>Conditions are attached to a services registration for various reasons. Such conditions are reviewed on an on-going basis and many have specific time frames attached as set out below:</p><p>- Where a provider has not addressed a noncompliance which impacts the safety of children</p><p>- Where there is a high level of noncompliance found on inspection</p><p>- To limit the number of children attending due to over crowding identified on inspection</p><p>- To limit the age profile as the facilities are not suitable</p><p>- To limit the type of service provided eg from full day care to sessional provision.</p><p>Tusla inspection reports and the register of early years services outline any conditions in place and this information is available on the Tusla website.</p><p>There are approximately 4,500 early years services registered with Tusla, all of which are inspected on a regular basis and in response to risks, including conditions attached.

Whilst primarily an early education initiative, the ECCE scheme is estimated to save parents using early learning and care services approximately &euro;5000 per child, over the course of the two years. </p><p>A range of measures I have taken have increased capacity in the sector. These include annual capital grants to increase the number of early learning and care and school age childcare places. The numbers of places has doubled since 2014.  A number of other initiatives have seen investment in services to assist them in covering their overhead costs and not having to pass these on to parents. For example, a 7% increase in the ECCE capitation in September 2017, and &euro;19.4m in Programme Support Payments annually to service owners to acknowledge the administrative workload associated with Government schemes.</p><p>Through the National Childcare Scheme and a range of other measures, I am committed to changing Ireland&rsquo;s childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world to one of the very best. In designing the National Childcare Scheme, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the Scheme can help as many families as possible.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. In this way, it aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes, and to make work pay for parents. </p><p>By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.</p><p>The Scheme has already been enhanced to expand the benefits for working families. As part of Budget 2019, the qualifying income thresholds were substantially raised.</p><p>The significant increase in the Scheme's maximum <b>net income</b>threshold from &euro;47,000 to &euro;60,000 per annum enables some families with a gross income of &euro;100,000 to qualify for income-related subsidies.  It means that an estimated 7,500 more children will benefit from the scheme relative to the original proposals.  Over 40,000 other children, already eligible, will see increases to their subsidies.</p><p>I am also very pleased that I have managed to adjust the lower income threshold, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a <b>net</b>annual income of up to &euro;26,000 (up from &euro;22,700).  This &lsquo;poverty proofs&rsquo; the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the very highest subsidy rates under the scheme. </p><p>Over the last four budgets, investment in childcare has risen by nearly 117%.  I acknowledge that more investment will be needed.  Historic under-investment in early learning and care has created a situation that has no quick solution.  The new National Childcare Scheme will establish a sustainable platform to enable us to continue investing for years to come.  The Scheme is designed to be flexible, allowing income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates to be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, the Scheme is fundamental to delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland. The National Childcare Scheme, alongside ECCE, and a host of other initiatives underway will make high quality services more accessible and more affordable for parents in Ireland.</p></reply>

Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care due to high staff turnover levels impacts directly on quality, and low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill the workforce. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care practitioners has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better child outcomes.</p>  <p>  Over the past 4 budgets the level of public investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare services has increased by 117%. The level of investment needs to continue to rise if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure staff wages and conditions will improve.</p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.</p>  <p>  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. Under the terms of industrial relations legislation, for the process of establishing a Sectoral Employment Order to begin, the bodies starting the process must satisfy the Labour Court that they are "substantially representative" of either the workers or the employers in the sector. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will readily co-operate with a Sectoral Employment Order process when it is under way. </p>  <p>  In the interim, I have introduced a range of measures to support employers to improve pay and conditions. These include a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; annual Programme Support Payments to recognise administrative demands; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.</p>  <p>  I have set out my vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, which contains a commitment to develop a Workforce Development Plan. This Plan, work on which began recently, will identify measures to ensure appropriate numbers of early learning and care and school-age childcare staff at all levels in the sector, to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028, and to raise the profile of careers in the sector. As part of this work, a series of public consultations will be carried out involving those working in the sector and other stakeholders. Plans for the consultation process will be finalised in the coming weeks. First 5 also commits to develop a new funding model for the sector, which may open up new mechanisms to influence pay and conditions in the sector.</p></reply>

The development of the Scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced changes to the income thresholds that will operate as part of the National Childcare Scheme when it is introduced later this year.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme&rsquo;s original policy proposals, income-based subsidies would have been available to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;47,500.  This threshold was increased by 26% to cover all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;60,000.  The scheme&rsquo;s lower income threshold was also adjusted upwards, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;26,000 (the previous proposed threshold stood at &euro;22,700).  These increased thresholds will mean that many more families will benefit from the new National Childcare Scheme once launched, and will see their childcare costs tangibly reduce.</p>  <p>  The &euro;50 million referenced by the Deputy refers to the increase in full-year costs of the Scheme in 2020 generated by the Budget 2019 changes. The Government was aware of and had factored in the 2020 full-year cost when it approved the enhancements to the National Childcare Scheme in Budget 2019. The Estimates process for 2020 is the appropriate mechanism to address 2020 costs.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as investment becomes available.  As such, it establishes a sustainable platform for investment in early learning and care and school age childcare for years to come. </p>  <p>  The investment referred to in the question addresses affordability for parents. Capacity in the system has doubled in recent years with twice as many early learning and care and school age childcare places available in centred based services. This has been supported by the 117% increase in investment over the last 4 budgets, including annual capital schemes to incentivise the creation of new places. The draft Childminding Action Plan currently being consulted on nationally also aims to increase capacity in the home based sector.</p></reply>

Primary amongst these is the CE Programme with an allocation of 1,000 dedicated ring-fenced drug rehabilitation places.  </p>  <p>  The CE Drug Rehabilitation Programme Framework was implemented in January 2016 and involves a multi-agency approach to rehabilitation and is designed to meet the challenging needs of individuals in recovery and to ensure effective and sustainable outcomes.  This integrated service response is based on interventions from a wide range of voluntary and community based addiction services and includes statutory engagement through the HSE and Local Education and Training Boards (LETB&rsquo;s).  The engagement of Local and Regional Alcohol and Drug Task Forces is also a feature of the scheme activities.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are 47 dedicated drug rehabilitation CE schemes nationally.  A total of 1008 participants are placed in drug rehabilitation places on CE (910 in the dedicated ring-fenced drug rehabilitation schemes and 98 in the drug rehabilitation placements in CE mainstream schemes).  The estimated cost of the dedicated schemes is in the region of &euro;20m.</p>  <p>  Bagenalstown FRC sponsors the L&aacute; Nua drug rehabilitation scheme. The scheme has been in operation since January 2015 and has approval for 15 participants and 2 Supervisors. Participant and Supervisor costs in the 12 months to 2 August 2019 amounted to &euro;196,429. Additional amounts of &euro;8847 and &euro;4455 were paid in respect of material and training costs. </p>  <p>  The weekly materials grant payable in respect of each participant on the L&aacute; Nua scheme was &euro;14.90 in the year to 2 August 2019. However, this was subsequently increased to &euro;20 per participant per week from August 2019 as a result of an additional &euro;2 million in CE materials which was provided for in the 2019 Budget. The full year cost of this increase for the L&aacute; Nua CE scheme is &euro;3,978. An additional training grant of &euro;500 per participant is available to the scheme, both for accredited and non-accredited training.</p>  <p>  The materials funding available to L&aacute; Nua CE scheme represents the maximum funding possible and I am advised that this is at the upper range of materials grant paid to schemes, even among dedicated drugs schemes which generally receive funding above the levels paid to other schemes. </p></reply>

Approximately 3,000 cases have been referred to DEASP under this Protocol since its inception.  People at risk of becoming homeless should make immediate contact with their local CWS Team or with the Threshold Tenancy Sustainment Service. </p>  <p>  Homeless people can also continue to avail of Employment Support Services from my Department and can continue to have access to a Case Officer during any period of homelessness as required. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Between July 2015 and September 2019, some 241,346 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service, see table 1.  Of this number, 52% were unemployed for over three years.  This group, in particular, faces significant barriers when seeking to enter or return to employment in the labour market. </p><p>To date, some 55,490 jobseekers have commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath.  Of this number, 49,660 had commenced full-time employment and 5,830 had commenced part-time employment.  It should be noted that many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service. They have not had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment nor sustain that employment for up to 52 weeks.  The measure of performance will improve as more clients complete their engagement with the service and have a chance to reach 52 weeks in employment. </p><p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the contractors.  The contractors are paid on the basis of performance and, with the exception of the initial registration fee, payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment.  </p><p>The total of fees claimed by the JobPath providers from 2015 to date is &euro;202.2m. </p><p>The recent econometric review of JobPath undertaken by my Department in partnership with the OECD noted that the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment with the JobPath service are 17% higher than the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment without the support of JobPath in 2018. Taken with the 26% improvement in employment outcomes in the same period, it means the overall positive employment/earnings impact is 37% in 2018 for those supported by the JobPath service.  These findings indicate that jobseekers who engage with JobPath are significantly more likely to get a positive employment outcome than those not supported by the service.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p><p><b>Table 1: Jobseekers referred to JobPath by year</b><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Jobseekers</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>6,591</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>65,453</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>74,867</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>60,768</td></tr><tr><td>2019 to date</td><td>33,667</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>241,346</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Contingency Action Plan Update outlines the regulatory impact of Brexit, the consequences for manufacturers, importers, distributors and authorised representatives and the mitigating actions to be taken.  As part of its outreach to the construction sector, the Department has facilitated a construction stakeholder forum for information sharing and preparedness purposes.  This forum includes members of construction sector interest groups together with representatives from Revenue, Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Building Control Office.  It met in July and September and will meet again on 24 October.  Sector preparedness actions have accelerated since the establishment of this group, with increased uptake of Revenue EORI registrations and customs preparation.  In addition, sector representatives report increased activity in terms of supply chain review and transfer of certificates to EU-27 Notified Bodies, where necessary, in advance of Brexit.</p><p>As indicated in the Brexit Contingency Action Plan update, the Irish and British Governments entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on 8 May 2019, reaffirming our joint commitment to the Common Travel Area.  This underpins the longstanding arrangements for Irish and UK nationals to move freely to live, work and study and access healthcare, social security and public services in each other&rsquo;s countries as well as to vote in certain elections. The Memorandum affords Irish citizens residing in the UK and UK nationals residing in Ireland, the right to access social housing, including supported housing and homeless assistance, in each other&rsquo;s State, on the same basis as citizens of that State. </p><p>My Department, in common with all others, continues to afford the highest priority to addressing Brexit related issues in its area, including in relation to housing/construction matters.</p></reply>

When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities. </p><p>To support the delivery of more affordable homes to buy or rent the Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), from 2019 to 2021 to provide infrastructure support for the delivery of over 6,000 dwellings.  The first call for proposals under the SSF in June 2018 was specifically targeted at 11 local authorities, where the greatest affordability pressures exists.  In December 2018, Approval in Principle was announced for funding for 10 infrastructure projects, in Dublin and Cork, with an allocated budget of &euro;43 million. This will support the delivery of approximately 1,400 affordable homes. </p><p>A second call for proposals under the SSF issued in April 2019 to 19 local authorities. I announced Approval in Principle for 25 infrastructure projects across 13 local authority areas on the 6th August 2019.  This significant funding commitment of &euro;84 million will support the delivery of 1,770 affordable homes for purchase.  Of these 25 projects approved, one was in Galway City and one in Galway County.  The projects, details of which can be found on the rebuildingireland.ie website at the following link were allocated a combined &euro;6.5 million in funding for infrastructure to support the delivery thereafter of 125 affordable homes.</p><p>.</p><p>I would anticipate that a further Call for Proposals will issue to local authorities in 2020.  SSF announcements to date mean that funding support has been allocated to enable delivery of almost 3,200 more affordable homes. The overall cost and the timing of delivery for SSF projects is contingent upon the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible. </p><p>This schemes will complement other key Government affordability initiatives, such as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have supported some 15,000 households nationally.</p></reply>

In reviewing rent limits, the Department worked closely with the DEASP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre. The HAP rent limits were increased significantly in July 2016, in the order of 60% in some areas. </p>  <p>  Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households face in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.</p>  <p>  HAP rent limits are kept under constant review, as is the use of discretion by local authorities, and data indicate that there is no need to increase the rent limits at this time. I am conscious that any such increase could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.

This allows qualified applicants to 'register an interest' in available homes. </p>  <p>  Applicants can act on their own initiative to respond to adverts and express an interest in dwellings that they would like to live in, rather than waiting for an authority to offer them a dwelling. This approach offers more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home, thereby reducing the likelihood of a refusal, and helping to build sustainable tenancies and stable communities. </p>  <p>  On 30 September 2016, the Social Housing Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2016 were made, which required that all local authorities must, if they had not already done so, provide for Choice Based Letting (CBL) as a potential method of allocation in their allocation schemes by 31 December 2016. </p>  <p>  Where a local authority, having included a provision on CBL in its allocation scheme, decides to operate a CBL scheme, it must implement it in accordance with Regulations 6 &ndash; 11 of the 2011 Regulations.  The way in which CBL is implemented, including decisions on which properties are to be offered through it, is a matter for the individual authority concerned. However, it must be done in accordance with the relevant regulations and their own scheme of priority. </p>  <p>  30 of the 31 local authorities have updated their allocation schemes to provide for CBL as a method of allocation. The remaining local authority has confirmed to my Department that it intends to bring forward an amended scheme, including a provision for CBL before the end of this year.</p>  <p>  My Department monitors the roll-out of CBL across all local authorities, and has undertaken a number of surveys to determine its uptake and impact. The most recent of these was conducted in the last quarter of 2018, at which stage 16 of the 31 local authorities indicated that they were operating a CBL model as part of their allocation scheme. A further 6 local authorities have indicated they were examining the feasibility of CBL with a view to rolling out a solution in the near future. The majority of those local authorities who had implemented it said that CBL has had a positive impact on how they allocate dwellings.</p>  <p>  Given the clear benefits offered by CBL, my Department will continue to liaise with the local authorities to ensure that it is implemented as widely as possible across the country. In fact, my Department will be meeting with local authority Directors of Housing later  in Quarter 4 this year to look at the operation of CBL.</p></reply>

The pyrite remediation scheme was first adopted in February 2014.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance, e.g. such as pyrite in concrete blocks.  </p>  <p>  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress and is limited in its application and scope. The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. </p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;2.2 million was provided to the Housing Agency in 2014 to meet expenditure incurred under the scheme in respect of design work, contractors, expenses to homeowners, operational costs, and the administrative costs to the Housing Agency. The remediation of 5 dwellings was completed in the final quarter of that year.</p>  <p>  An additional sum of &euro;10 million was made available in Budget 2015 to fund the operation of the scheme in 2015, when a further 148 dwellings had remedial works completed under the scheme.</p>  <p>  &euro;26.6 million was provided for the scheme in 2016. Some 400 dwellings were remediated under the scheme in 2016 giving an aggregate total of 553 dwellings completed since the scheme was first introduced.</p>  <p>   In 2017, some &euro;25 million was provided, facilitating the remediation of some 400 additional dwellings, giving an aggregate total of 945 dwellings completed from when the scheme was first introduced up to the end of 2017. </p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2018. This allocation facilitated the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings in 2018 giving an aggregate total of 1,378 dwellings completed since the scheme was first introduced in February 2014. The total allocation was expended in each of the years 2014 to 2018.</p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that 2,473 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme. Of these, 2,003 dwellings have been included in the scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.  A further 87 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 219 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process. 164 applications under the scheme were not successful.</p>  <p>   Of the 2,003 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme: 55 are at remedial works planning stage, 7 are at tender / tender analysis, 247 are under remediation, and 1,694 are complete.</p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;32 million is available to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year, of which &euro;22 million has been drawn down by the Housing Agency to date. I understand that the Housing Agency estimate that a minimum of &euro;30 million will be drawn down by the end of 2019. This will facilitate the remediation of some 460 additional dwellings. This will bring to approximately &euro;126m the total funding provided under the scheme since 2014. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, the Pyrite Resolution Board, together with the Housing Agency, will arrange for all eligible dwellings to be remediated to a high standard and at no additional cost to the affected homeowners. Remediation works will continue to be carried out at the earliest possible opportunity having regard to the existing demands of the scheme and the optimum use of available resources.</p></reply>

Delivery is also happening through long-term leasing and acquisitions. </p>  <p>  As housing authorities, the local authorities are responsible for the identification of the social housing need in their areas and for the development of appropriate responses to meet this need. While there is no prescribed maximum scale or size for new social housing development, the approach to developments by the local authorities is dependent on the precise circumstances and location and they are best positioned to assess this, in line with guidance provided by my Department through the publication 'Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities', which is available on my Department's website at the following link:  www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad%2C1979%2Cen.pdf.</p>  <p>  In seeking funding approval from my Department for new social housing homes, whether through build, acquisition or leasing activity, local authorities must confirm that they are satisfied that the proposal is appropriate to the local area, supports the development of sustainable communities and represents value for money. For the latter, an independent valuation is usually provided by the local authorities who also work within guide costs from my Department, which vary depending on location and sizes of properties.</p></reply>

In addition to this, I decided, at the beginning of this year to carry forward a sum of &euro;0.7m, unspent by the Department in 2018 and to add it to An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s&rsquo; capital budget. This has resulted in my Department  providing An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s with a total capital budget of &euro;9.7m in 2019. </p>  <p>  When the &euro;3.86m in total funding allocated recently to An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, as well as the &euro;2m in funding for P&aacute;irc na Mara in Cill Chiar&aacute;in allocated to An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, is included, it results in an overall capital funding allocation of &euro;15.56m being available to An t&Uacute;daras in 2019.</p>  <p>   As the Deputy will be aware, it is through the annual budgetary and estimates process that Exchequer funding is allocated to my department and indeed to all Government Departments. In this context the Deputy will understand  that the  2020 allocation for Irish Language and Gaeltacht organisations, including &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta,  is currently being considered as part of this process.</p>  <p>  Needless to say, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to advocate for  additional capital funding for An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s in order to further support the organisation in discharging its functions.</p></reply>

It was first confirmed in the wild in Ireland in July 2019. The first two records came from rabbits &ndash; one in Wicklow, the other in Clare. The first report from an Irish hare came on the 9th August &ndash; an animal found dying in the Wexford Slobs Nature Reserve. </p>  <p>  Since these initial incidents, a request for public involvement has led to more than 50 reports of dead rabbits and hares around the country. Each report has been followed up by the local NPWS ranger. From these incidents the disease has now been confirmed from six different counties &ndash; Cork, Clare, Leitrim, Offaly, Wicklow and Wexford. </p>  <p>  A post mortem of each dead animal has been carried out by qualified personnel in the regional laboratories of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine. Tissue samples have then been sent to DAFM&rsquo;s specialist virology lab in Backweston where the RHD tests take place. I am fully satisfied with the objectivity and expertise of the DAFM laboratories. </p>  <p>  To date, of the hares tested, two have tested positive and one negative for the disease. NPWS staff around the country are continuing to monitor reports of wild rabbit and hare deaths to gain a fuller understanding of the extent and impact of this disease in Ireland. At least 4 more hares from three different counties are currently with DAFM for testing.</p>  <p>  The ongoing monitoring of hare populations and health by the Irish Coursing Club is acknowledged and welcomed. Officials from my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service will continue to engage with Irish Coursing Club representatives and DAFM with a view to developing an appropriate, effective and workable strategy to deal with the RHD2 virus and counter the threat it poses to the hare in Ireland in the longer term.  </p></reply>
