    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-01a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100100059#WRA00800"><p>Everyone is aware that the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU will pose significant challenges for Ireland.  The challenges posed by a no-deal departure will be particularly acute.</p>  <p>  The Government has been putting in place the utmost Brexit preparations since even before the outcome of the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership became known.  Since then, Budget 2017, Budget 2018 and Budget 2019 have all contained measures to ensure that Ireland is in the best possible position to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring. </p>  <p>  These measures continue the process of assuring that Ireland&rsquo;s economy remains competitive and resilient against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty, and include balancing our books; reducing our debt burden; putting in place a major programme of capital investment; establishing the Rainy Day Fund; and broadening the tax base.</p>  <p>  Specific initiatives have been introduced aimed at supporting those sectors most affected by Brexit, most notably the Brexit Loan Scheme in Budget 2018 and the Future Growth Loan Scheme in Budget 2019.  The Future Growth Loan Scheme is open to eligible Irish enterprises, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. The Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital loans, at least 40% of which is available for food businesses.</p>  <p>  The Government and its agencies have also put in place extensive supports and advisory resources to ensure that the sectors likely to be most impacted are prepared for Brexit.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the Summer Economic Statement set out two budgetary scenarios for Budget 2020, the first involving an orderly departure by the UK from the EU and the second involving a disorderly exit.  Last month the Government decided that the budgetary strategy to be adopted should be based on the latter assumption. </p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government has already said that it will provide counter-cyclical support to the economy through social protection payments occasioned by higher unemployment and, on the revenue side, lower tax collections which help cushion aggregate demand. </p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government will also introduce timely, targeted, temporary measures. Brexit contingency support may also be needed to address specific issues in the event of a &lsquo;worst case scenario&rsquo; disorderly Brexit.  I am working with the relevant Ministers on such measures in the context of Budget 2020.</p>  <p>  All of these measures form part of a comprehensive response to Brexit across all sectors which has been set out in the Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, which was updated in July. This is the second update of the Plan that was originally published in December 2018 and reflects the extensive work that  has taken place to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s management of the economy, however, means that Ireland is facing the challenge of Brexit from a position of economic strength.  The Irish economy continues to grow at a robust pace and we are close to full employment.  But we do not underestimate the challenges ahead and will be prepared.</p></reply>

These include reducing velocities to ensure no damage to the bed of the river and associated ecosystems, and minimising impacts on the pearl mussel and crayfish populations, and adhering to EU legislation in relation to alluvial woodlands. </p><p><b></b>The project team is ensuring that any tasks that can be progressed in parallel with the above environmental assessment will be prioritised, in order to minimise any programme delays. </p><p>It is anticipated that the detailed design and preparation of the relevant documentation should be completed to allow the proposed scheme to be submitted to Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for formal Confirmation under the Arterial Drainage Act by the end of the year.  </p><p>Following Confirmation and tendering it is anticipated that the scheme should progress to construction in the second half of 2020.</p><p>Once the proposed scheme is confirmed, the OPW will contact landowners directly in order to provide information and advice prior to construction commencing. </p><p>As previously highlighted, in the interim, the following measures are in place to help alleviate the flooding problems in the town pending the delivery of the flood relief scheme:</p><p><i>- Individual Property Protection (IPP)</i>: The OPW and Mayo County Council in conjunction with the local Flood Action Group, have substantially progressed the pilot IPP project for Crossmolina, which has already installed floodgates in approximately 100 properties. </p><p><i>- Maintenance</i>: The OPW has carried out maintenance works including lowering of the berm downstream of Jack Garrett Bridge.</p><p><i>- Minor Works</i>: The OPW has also approved Mayo County Council's application for funding for a number of minor works projects in the town, and these have been put in place by the Council. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the OPW will continue to work constructively with Mayo County Council and the local Flood Action Group to take all feasible interim measures to alleviate the risk of flooding in the town.  </p><p>Crossmolina is a priority project within the OPW&rsquo;s flood investment programme and the project team are working hard to minimise further delays and to bring this much needed project to construction and completion.</p></reply>

Of this, &euro;59.3 billion is gross voted current expenditure, while &euro;7.3 billion is gross voted capital expenditure.  </p>  <p>  The effective and efficient delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and Department. In relation to spending, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on each month against expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-August 2019 was &euro;42,015 million. This is &euro;262 million, or 0.6%, below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;38,653 million, is &euro;132 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-August. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;3,362 million, is &euro;130 million, or 3.7% below profile and up &euro;683 million, or 25.5% on the same period last year. The end-September Fiscal monitor will be published later this week. </p>  <p>  At this stage in the year, it is too early to definitively state what the requirement for Supplementary Estimates will be at year-end. Expenditure Report 2020, which will be published on Budget Day, will set out an initial assessment of any necessary additional expenditure for 2019. This would take into account any policy decisions, such as relating to a Social Welfare Christmas Bonus, and any emerging expenditure pressures. While the end-August position is encouraging, there is a particular challenge in the Health sector, where the year-on-year increase to the end of August illustrates the challenge and the need for staffing and savings measures to be proactively managed by the Department of Health. There are also potential pressures in the areas of Justice and Education.</p></reply>

The main purpose of capital projects and associated investment undertaken by my Department is to support greater effectiveness and efficiency across the Civil and Public Service.  While all counties ultimately benefit from this, any capital expenditure is primarily invested in the Department's ICT systems to support and develop the ICT function across Government.</p>  <p>  More generally, my role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is to oversee the effective implementation of the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and to maintain the national frameworks such as the Public Spending Code within which Departments operate to ensure appropriate accounting for, and value for money in, public expenditure. </p>  <p>  My Department does not have a direct role in overseeing projects being progressed by other Departments.  That responsibility rests with the appropriate Minister responsible for the Sanctioning Authority who approved the project, under the policy of delegated sanction that operates in relation to capital expenditure within the capital budgets allocated to line Ministers/Departments.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Public Spending Code sets out the oversight and approval process for public expenditure proposals including capital projects. The responsibilities which lie with different roles are clearly set out in the Code. The Department or agency proposing and implementing a project is responsible for appraisal, planning, implementation, management and post project review of the project. It is known as the Sponsoring Agency. The Department or body funding the project is responsible for approval in principle following appraisal, pre-tender approval, and post tender approval if the project has significantly changed. It is known as the Sanctioning Authority.</p></reply>

These are primary areas of current expenditure that are particularly impacted by demographic pressures. These demographic projections are informed by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) paper &lsquo;<i>Budgetary Impacts of Changing Demographics 2017 &ndash; 2027</i>.&rsquo; The paper can be found on the IGEES website here: .</p><p>This paper covers a number of areas of expenditure, including pensions, child benefit, education provision and in health areas such as the acute hospitals, PCRS, community and  Nursing Home Support Scheme.

However, as part of the 2019 Spending Review process, an update of this paper is due to be published. This forthcoming paper will again look at the key areas of Health, Social Protection and Education and will examine demographic pressures in these areas over a ten year period.</p><p>More generally, introducing multi-annual funding for the totality of the Health budget would involve considerable challenges, not least in terms of establishing confidence in the soundness of the underlying financial management systems and in the ability of the Health system as a whole to plan and manage its resources on both an annual and multi-annual basis. I am hopeful that the improved leadership and governance arrangements that have recently been put in place in the Health sector, including the establishment of the HSE Board, may help to underpin confidence in such areas into the future.</p></reply>

This forthcoming paper will again look at the key areas of Health, Social Protection and Education and will examine demographic pressures in these areas over a ten year period. </p><p>More generally, introducing multi-annual funding for the totality of the Health budget would involve considerable challenges, not least in terms of establishing confidence in the soundness of the underlying financial management systems and in the ability of the Health system as a whole to plan and manage its resources on both an annual and multi-annual basis. I am hopeful that the improved leadership and governance arrangements that have recently been put in place in the Health sector, including the establishment of the HSE Board, may help to underpin confidence in such areas into the future.</p></reply>

The Departments responsible for the achievement of these targets will, over the coming months, be developing the policies and measures required to reach these targets. These policies and measures will incorporate a blend of expenditure, taxation, regulation and behavioural change initiatives that will encourage the investment decisions required across the public and private sectors, as well as by individual citizens, to achieve these targets.</p>  <p>  Much of the Exchequer investment required to support these policies and measures was already anticipated and provided for through the commitments included in the National Development Plan (NDP), which includes over &euro;30bn in investment to fund the transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society and initiatives in sustainable mobility. </p>  <p>  The Government has agreed that the cumulative Exchequer costs of the commitments included in the Climate Action Plan will be delivered within the existing multi-annual ceilings and the funding commitments made in the NDP. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, any new revenue raised from any increase in the carbon tax in 2020 will be ring-fenced and used to fund new climate action measures, including just transition.</p></reply>

The Further Revised Estimates were necessary as the Government recognised that the allocations set out in the Revised Estimates, published in December 2018, needed to be updated to reflect the materialising construction cost of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  To that end, the Government decided that in relation to the 2019 allocations an additional &euro;75 million capital expenditure allocation would be provided to the Department of Health to be met by reallocations from savings made in other sectors within the overall &euro;7.3 billion capital allocation for 2019.   </p>  <p>  As set out in the Summer Economic Statement an expenditure reserve of up to &euro;0.2 billion is to be established in 2020 to accommodate funding requirements liable to arise in connection with the National Broadband Plan and National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  No decision has been made at this time regarding the specific allocation of this reserve as the funding of additional costs in relation to these projects will be considered as part of the Budget 2020 estimates process, reflecting the most up-to-date position relating to capital spending at the time.  Beyond 2020, the Summer Economic Statement reflects the impact on the General Government Balance of additional expenditure in respect of the National Broadband Plan. </p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, I intend to provide the additional capital required to fund the National Broadband project from future revenues - this will be done in the context of updating the overall multi-annual capital ceilings set out in Project Ireland 2040.  No other projects will be delayed or rescheduled, and no other changes will be made to the capital allocations for other projects as set out in the National Development Plan as a consequence of the Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with the National Broadband Plan. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for individual projects rests with the relevant Departments.  My Department, on the other hand, is responsible for monitoring expenditure allocations at Departmental level, so I can tell him that, up to the end of August, expenditure in 2019 is being managed for both the National Broadband Plan and the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in line with the allocations set out in the Further Revised Estimates.</p></reply>

It will protect 236 properties and bring much needed relief from the worry and stress which flooding has caused to householders and businesses in the town.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the scheme is at an advanced stage of planning and design. A formal Exhibition was held in May 2019 where the public were able to review the scheme design and measures and provide feedback on what is being proposed. The scheme proposals were generally well received and the lead consultants are currently reviewing the feedback received and finalising the design and all the documentation required for submission of the scheme for formal Confirmation of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

Following Confirmation it is expected to commence construction in 2020 after tendering, with an estimated construction period of 3 years. </p>  <p>  The proposed scheme will be funded by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and I can confirm that provision for the cost of the scheme is included in the OPW's multi-annual capital framework.</p></reply>

This level of increase in voted current expenditure is significantly below that seen in the period leading up to the fiscal and economic crisis.  Over the period between the end of 2004 and 2009 gross voted current expenditure grew by 57%. </p>  <p>  A targeted approach has seen additional funding directed towards priority areas.  Gross voted current expenditure on Health, after adjusting for the disestablishment of the HSE Vote, has risen by over &euro;4 billion or over 30%.  Housing programme current expenditure has increased by almost &euro;1 billion or over 200%.   </p>  <p>  Over the last five years, in order to enhance the resilience and growth capacity of the economy, significant additional resources have been made available for capital expenditure.  Indeed, Exchequer capital investment, which represented under 7 per cent of total voted expenditure in 2014, accounts for a quarter of the overall expenditure increase in this five year period, with gross voted capital expenditure having increased by 90%.  Total capital investment of &euro;25 billion in this period has supported the delivery of economic and social infrastructure and the creation of jobs. </p>  <p>  In recent Budgets, in order to increase the resources available for spending increases tax raising measures have been introduced. Indeed, as outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, over the period 2017 to 2019, as a result of tax raising measures and the non-utilisation of the full available fiscal space for tax measures an additional &euro;1.9 billion was made available for expenditure increases over and above that originally planned in the 2016 Summer Economic Statement.</p>  <p>  In light of the current position in relation to the UK's exit from the EU, Budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit. Underlying this decision is the need to ensure the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of the Brexit challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. This strategy involves a &lsquo;twin-track&rsquo; approach of providing funding for key public services and also supporting the sectors and regions most exposed to Brexit related disruption. </p></reply>

A number of measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure and budgetary targets are being achieved on an ongoing basis. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Fiscal Monitor.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-August 2019 was &euro;42,015 million. This is &euro;262 million, or 0.6% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;38,653 million, is &euro;132 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-August. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;3,362 million, is &euro;130 million, or 3.7% below profile and up &euro;683 million, or 25.5% on the same period last year. The end-September Fiscal monitor will be published later this week.</p>  <p>  Due to the scale of Government expenditure, over &euro;66 billion in aggregate for 2019, and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons. This includes in-year policy decisions, timing issues and overspends in particular areas.</p>  <p>  Expenditure Report 2020, which will be published on Budget Day, will set out an initial assessment of any necessary additional expenditure for 2019. In relation to policy decisions this would include the decision in relation to this year&rsquo;s Social Welfare Christmas Bonus.  Looking at areas where expenditure pressures may arise, while the end-August position is encouraging, there is a particular challenge in the Health sector, where the year-on-year increase to the end of August illustrates the challenge and the need for staffing and savings measures to be proactively managed by the Department of Health. There are also potential pressures in the areas of Justice arising from pressures in relation to Asylum Seekers Accommodation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the continued uncertainty in relation to the timing of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union has required that the impacted Departments and Offices incur expenditure to ensure that we are in a position to respond to the emerging position. To the extent that offsetting underspends are not available this would necessitate certain Supplementary Estimates.</p>  <p>  The White Paper to be published this Friday will set out the aggregate forecast expenditure outturn for the year taking into account an assessment of potential Supplementary Estimate requirements.   </p></reply>

These arrangements enable them to maintain control over vulnerable sites while at the same time ensuring that a level of supervised public access is maintained for visitors.</p>  <p>  The stipend paid to keyholders and caretakers varies with the level of duties undertaken but it is fair to reflect that the amounts paid are not large and represent a token payment to these individuals who generally provide these services more out of respect and love for the Monument in their care rather than as a wage reflecting a full-time commitment.  Notwithstanding this, the OPW has been conscious that the level of payment provided for these services is low and might be reviewed.</p>  <p>  Understanding that the arrangements currently in place at sites around the country have been in force for many years and have been instituted at different times, the first step in the process, which has already been undertaken, has been to standardise payments across the portfolio and address local anomalies that have arisen in certain cases.  The next stage in the process will be to perform a review of the size of the payments with a view to adopting a broad modest increase.   I must stress that what is envisaged is not likely to result in a large increase in the stipend and certainly will not equate to a full-time wage for any individual involved who generally provide the services on an occasional / part-time basis.  OPW intends to implement any changes to rates early in 2020 once the Estimates process has concluded and available resources for various commitments have been set out in its annual Business Plan. </p></reply>

The practical effect of this is that for new entrants the relevant points on the scale will be bypassed, thereby reducing the time spent on the scale for progression to the maximum point.</font></p><p><font color="#333333">- this measure will apply from 1 March 2019 and will be applied to each new entrant as they reach the relevant scale points (point 4 and point 8) on their current increment date.</font></p><p>The cost of this measure during the remaining term of the PSSA is &euro;75 million, with the full cost of the measure based on current data and public service numbers (2017) accruing over the period out to 2026. It is estimated that some 58% (35,750) of new entrants will benefit from this measure in year 1, rising to 78% (47,750) by year 2.</p></reply>

Benchmarked against best international practice, the proposed Scheme&rsquo;s multifaceted approach takes account of the complexity of flooding in Cork which is both tidal and fluvial (river).  </p>  <p>  Flooding in 2009 and 2014 resulted in a reported &euro;140 million of damage in Cork and caused severe stress to the residents and business owners in the city.</p>  <p>  The proposed scheme will provide protection to over 900 homes and 1200 business properties in the City.  It will also facilitate significant public realm improvements in the city centre area, making it more attractive to live and work in and to visit. These improvements which include walkways and cycle ways will encourage a switch from cars to other more environmentally friendly transport modalities and should act as a catalyst for investment and development in the city.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has recently published further details and images of the proposals and it is hoped that these will assuage some misunderstanding about the Scheme and also challenge significant misrepresentation of it as well. The various public consultation phases of the project have been very helpful in informing the design of the Scheme. While the Scheme cannot deviate from the comprehensive scientific and empirical analysis on which it is based, it has taken into account many of the suggestions made during the public consultation stages. As further details and images are completed they will be put into the public domain, which will allow the public to see the overall picture of the scheme.</p></reply>

This work will continue in Budget 2020.  </p>  <p>  Given heightened uncertainty around Brexit, two budgetary scenarios were set out in the Summer Economic Statement.  The first involved an orderly exit by the UK, while the second involved a disorderly Brexit.  The Government has now decided that Budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In particular, it is envisaged that there will be a number of temporary, targeted supports for sectors of the economy hardest hit, while capital supports will be required, primarily in relation to infrastructure required at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport.</p>  <p>  Any extra borrowing that might arise would cause an increase in national debt.  The NTMA is continuing with its strategy of pre-funding to meet future redemptions.

These cover elements of an all-island SPS zone, as well as customs, and manufactured goods.  These non-papers do not constitute formal proposals from the UK, and do not amount to legally operational solutions.  </p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach stated after his recent meeting with Prime Minister Johnson in New York, there remains a significant gap between what the UK is putting forward, and what Ireland and the EU can accept. Neither Ireland nor the EU can move away from an agreed negotiated position to an unknown and untested solution. It is the UK&rsquo;s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement.</p></reply>

These should be raised with the European Commission. Negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU are a matter for the European Commission Task Force, led by chief negotiator Michel Barnier, and the UK Government. </p>  <p>   As both Michel Barnier and I have stated on numerous occasions it is up to the UK to provide proposals, which should be credible, concrete and legally operable and capable of achieving the same outcome as the backstop. This means that any solutions must avoid a hard border, fully protect the Good Friday Agreement and North-South cooperation, and preserve the all-island economy, as well the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. </p>  <p>   I met with Michel Barnier on 27 September and we had a chance to exchange views on our recent engagements with our British counterparts and to take stock together of where we are.  While contacts between the UK and Commission Taskforce are continuing, the Commission have made clear that the ideas and concepts presented by the UK are technical non-papers rather than detailed, credible proposals and would not be legally operable, nor deliver the same outcomes as the backstop.  The issue of a special economic zone was not discussed during the meeting and has not been raised by the UK during its ongoing discussions with the Task Force.</p>  <p>   It is important to acknowledge that Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement does put in place a specific arrangement for Northern Ireland which responds to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. The backstop provides alignment with those rules of the Single Market and Customs Union necessary to avoid a hard border, thus protecting the Good Friday Agreement, and to protect the Single Market. These arrangements enable Northern Ireland businesses to trade freely with both the rest of the UK and with the EU. </p>  <p>   A no deal outcome will never be the choice of Ireland, or the EU, but we cannot move away from an agreed negotiated position to an unknown and untested solution. Responsibility for avoiding a no deal outcome lies with the UK. </p></reply>

Ireland is now one of only 22 countries worldwide that have adopted national action plans on Business and Human Rights.</p>  <p>  A key action identified was the establishment of the Business and Human Rights Implementation Group to monitor delivery of the National Plan.   The Implementation Group, established in December 2018, is mandated to meet at least twice per year. I was pleased to be able to participate in the inaugural meeting of the Group on 16 January 2019.  The Group is chaired by Ms Breege O'Donoghue and brings together representatives of 23 organisations, from Government Departments and State Agencies, the business sector and civil society.  The Implementation Group went on to hold its first working meeting on 3 April 2019 and is scheduled to meet again in October. </p>  <p>  A second commitment of the National Plan was a comprehensive baseline assessment of the legislative and regulatory framework for business and human rights in Ireland. My Department commissioned independent consultants to carry out this research in 2018, the final report of which is available on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s website. At its meeting in April the Implementation Group considered the findings of the baseline assessment and the establishment of three sub-groups, each tasked with prioritising and delivering key actions under the three pillars of the UN Guiding Principles, namely, the state duty to protect, corporate responsibility to respect and access to remedy. </p></reply>

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of the proposals.  </p><p>Regarding question 39806/19, I am advised by Revenue that capital gains tax (CGT) entrepreneur relief applies to an individual who disposes of qualifying assets which have been owned by that individual for a continuous period of at least 3 years in the 5-year period immediately prior to the disposal of the assets. The rate of CGT on such disposals is 10%. </p><p>To qualify for CGT entrepreneur relief, the qualifying assets must have been used for the purposes of a qualifying business carried on by the individual disposing of the assets. Land which has been leased by an individual to a long-term tenant would not, therefore, qualify for the relief as it will not have been used for the purposes of a business carried on by the individual concerned.</p><p>Regarding Question No. 152, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the higher lifetime CGT limit in the UK which applies to their Entrepreneur Relief scheme. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that latest estimates suggest that the cost of increasing the lifetime limit to &euro;10 million, in the absence of any behavioural changes would have a full year cost of &euro;81 million.</p><p>The Department of Finance produces a TSG paper annually on Capital Taxes.

At the same time, the strong economic performance in recent years has also seen the debt-to-income ratio fall significantly. Balancing the books is a meaningful signal of an economy moving into a more mature, sustainable phase.</p>  <p>  That said, despite the very significant progress that has been made by this Government, at 104 per cent of GNI*, debt levels remain high by both historical and international standards. Indeed, on a per capita basis, public indebtedness stood at &euro;42,500 per person last year, amongst the highest in the OECD. Similarly, servicing of debt represents a significant operating cost for the State, with last year&rsquo;s annual payment close to the entire capital budget for 2018. These figures illustrate why fiscal sustainability remains a key priority for this Government, especially in view of the highly uncertain international environment, including the impact of Brexit, and less favourable demographics in the coming decades as the population ages.  </p>  <p>  In light of these risks, a responsible approach to managing the public finances is required. To that end, my Department recently published the Annual Report on Public Debt in Ireland 2019. This report provided in-depth analysis of current and future debt dynamics. The evidence provided in this report clearly illustrates the importance of continuing to reduce the public debt burden, while at the same time undertaking investment and structural reforms that boost domestic employment and income levels, as these can impact favourably on the burden of debt.</p></reply>

There are a further 297 personal injury claimants who have yet to settle their claims. I have been informed by the State Claims Agency that a further 92 personal injury claims settlements have now been agreed and are included in the current submission to the Fund. This brings the total number of personal injury claimants who have agreed settlements to 888.  In addition to the settled cases submitted to the Fund there have also been 21 cases where the claims were either dismissed or withdrawn and consequently there will be no draw on the Fund in respect of these claimants. The latest information from the liquidator indicates that the total value of all payments (settlements, legal costs, etc.) in the next tranche will be approximately &euro;6.9 million.</p>  <p>  Regarding when the next payments will be made, the Deputy will note that in accordance with the relevant legislation, there are certain steps to be completed in preparing any application to the High Court for payment from the ICF. These steps include the assessment and verification of each individual claim within the application by the State Claims Agency.  The Agency has advised my officials that the next application for a call on the fund for Setanta claims will likely be in the 2nd half of October 2019.</p>  <p>  In relation Deputy Chamber&rsquo;s request for an update on a particular case, my officials have checked this matter with the State Claims Agency and they have indicated that there is no claim outstanding, but that there is a refund of premiums due. They indicated that while  the refund of premiums for commercial and personal insurance policies is not covered by the Insurance Compensation fund, there is a possibility that a portion of any such refund due, may be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta's Insurance assets on completion of the liquidation process.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Liquidator continues to make every effort to settle these claims on the best possible terms, however, each and every one of these claimants are in the litigation process and consequently it is difficult to predict exactly when all of these claimants will settle. This in turn means it is not possible to say at this stage when it will be known whether there will be any money available to make any refund of premiums.  Consequently, any individual (or their solicitor) who has queries about either an outstanding claim or a refund of premiums  should contact the liquidator via phone at +353 (0)818 255 255 or via email at iesetanta@deloitte.ie.</p></reply>

SFCT is an excise duty that applies to coal and peat when first supplied in the State for use as a fuel. Neither the movement of solid fuel into the State nor the physical presence of solid fuel in the State generate a liability to SFCT. Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to coal coming into the State from Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border controls in relation to the movement of solid fuel into the State from other Member States. Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel entering the State from Northern Ireland. Similarly, the transportation or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.  </p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK will be come a third country and will be outside of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union.  Any imports of products from a third country, including the UK, will be subject to EU customs requirements.  The exact implications of this for trade and customs compliance between Ireland and Northern Ireland are currently the subject of discussions with the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  Currently in Northern Ireland, there is no carbon tax on coal and solid fuel environmental standards are lower than in the State. These factors combined with currency fluctuations and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s lower VAT rate on solid fuel can give rise to significant price differentials between the two jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  As I and my predecessor have pointed out before, the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities who have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel, collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards and to prosecute traders involved in selling coal that does not meet these standards. The Regulations also provide for the establishment of a register of coal suppliers by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is in contact with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that solid fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here. I understand that contacts are ongoing with a view to undertaking a number of joint operations and to explore the scope for follow up action by Revenue in relation to persons found to be in breach of environmental regulations.</p></reply>

Under this Directive, Member States are obliged to exempt certain fuels used for commercial aviation purposes from excise duty. The scope of this exemption must include jet fuel (which is the most commonly used heavy oil in air navigation) and must encompass such fuel used for intra-Community and international air transport purposes. A Member State may waive this exemption where it has entered into a bilateral agreement with another Member State to tax fuel for intra-community flights. With regard to fuel for international transport, the scope for a Member State to take a unilateral approach to taxation is limited by international law and a range of bilateral and multilateral agreements that operate under 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation (known as the Chicago Convention).  </p><p>VAT is charged on domestic and private usage of jet fuel at the reduced rate of 13.5%, while VAT is charged at the standard rate of 23% on aviation gasoline used for the same purpose.  The supply of aviation fuel for international air travel is zero rated and airline tickets are exempt from VAT throughout the EU.</p><p>I am advised that consumption data required to estimate the revenue that could be accrued, if the Excise Duty applied fully to aviation fuel with no exemptions, is not readily available. According to the CSO, the revenue foregone due to the excise exemption on aviation fuel was &euro;494 million in 2016. However, this is a theoretical amount that cannot be realised under the current EU and international legislative framework.</p><p>Finally, I am informed by Revenue that the breakdown of taxes levied on the different types of aviation fuel as provided for under the Finance Act 1999 and Energy Tax Directive are shown in the following table. <table><tr><th>Aviation Fuel/Use</th><th>Energy Tax Directive</th><th>Finance Act 1999</th></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for domestic commercial aviation </td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;355.44 per 1,000 litres (section 97B Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for intra-Community/international commercial   aviation</td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;355.44 per 1,000 litres (section 97B Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for private pleasure flying</td><td>Mandatory taxation</td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;587.71 per 1,000 litres (section 96 Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for domestic commercial aviation</td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Full exemption (section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for used for intra-Community/international commercial   aviation</td><td>Mandatory tax exemption, except where bilateral arrangement entered into with another Member State</td><td>Full exemption (section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for private pleasure flying</td><td>Mandatory taxation</td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;479.02 per 1,000 litres (section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This approach would align it with the current EU fiscal rules framework, whereby it could be accommodated as an &ldquo;unusual event&rdquo; under the existing Stability and Growth Pact provisions. Withdrawals from the Fund will be transferred directly to the Exchequer so as to support the tax shortfalls and/or voted expenditure to address the specific downturn.</p>  <p>  The Act deliberately does not describe specific events, such as Brexit or others, so as to give flexibility to Governments to withdraw from the Fund for all severe downturns, many of which are not possible to specify in advance. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the occurrence of a force majeure event could justify deployment of the Fund. Therefore, I expect a significant fiscal impact and/or an economic downturn arising from a no-deal Brexit would clearly allow for a drawdown from the Rainy Day Fund.  </p>  <p>  I should stress that a drawdown from the Rainy Day Fund should not be the first action taken in the face of a no-deal Brexit, as the Government has already taken significant steps to prepare for Brexit and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  These steps to prepare for the fallout of Brexit include dedicated measures, and economic and fiscal policies to get Ireland Brexit ready in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Such policies include, amongst others, moving to fiscal balance, the rolling out of support schemes, and the provision of advice to businesses.  </p>  <p>  I would, therefore, envisage the National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund only being used for an extreme outcome, i.e. &ldquo;tail-risks&rdquo; related to Brexit and in advance of seeking approval to withdraw from the Fund, the magnitude of the impact would have to be properly considered.</p>  <p>  My sensible approach to using the Rainy Day Fund is that I want to ensure its funds are available and used to support measures that are timely, targeted and temporary, which assist in converting our economy and its businesses to a post-Brexit world.</p></reply>

However it is possible that the cost could be lower due to the limits on the payable credit.  This cost does not take account of any possible behavioural change by companies to avail of the increased credit. </p>  <p>  Regarding Question No. 144, on the assumption that all SMEs avail of this proposal, and assuming no behavioural change, I am advised by Revenue that, while the measure would be cost-neutral over the longer term, the first year cost of the measure, based on the cashflow impact to the Exchequer, is likely to be of the order of c.&euro;57 million. This is due to the second and third installments of the repayable credit being paid along with the first installment.</p></reply>

The statement also includes detailed information on the levy process and its cost control and budgetary processes, including Commission approval of annual budgets, and oversight of quarterly outturns against those budgets. </p><p>Each phased increase required my or my predecessor's approval of the annual industry funding regulations.  In 2017, the then Minister for Finance approved a phased increase to 100% industry funding commencing with an increase from 50% to 65% in 2017<b></b>(S.I. No. 442/2017 - The Central Bank Act 1942 (Section 32D) Regulations 2017).  In 2018, I agreed to an increase in recovery rates from 65% to 80% (in certain categories) with corresponding increases in other categories (S.I. No. 445 of 2018 - The Central Bank Act 1942 (Section 32D) Regulations 2018).</p><p>At the time of this increase, the Central Bank issued a Funding Strategy and Guide to the 2018 Industry Funding Levy. This guide provides significant detail on the levy strategy and the plans to 2021.  The move towards full funding is part of a wider levy strategy, which includes moving to levying in arrears in the next levy cycle.  This will eliminate significant prior year shortfalls and surpluses which resulted in volatility in the past.  No levies will issue in 2019 as actual costs will be levied on an arrears basis in mid-2020.</p><p>Earlier this year, I agreed to the phased increase of all financial sectors to 100% funding by 2024.  However, I specifically provided for an exception for Credit Unions so they will only reach 50% funding by 2021.  This has been well flagged to the sector and I have also agreed to not increase credit union regulatory funding beyond 50%  until the impact of the move to 50% is reviewed and a further public consultation is undertaken.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-01a.239.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100100063#WRE01600"><p>The Deputy has raised several issues in his question concerning the answer I supplied to PQ No. 55 of 19 September 2019 about surcharges for those self-employed who fail to make a local property tax return or pay their LPT. As I set out in that response, as with other taxes and duties, penalties can be imposed for various offences such as failure to submit returns or other documentation or the provision of false information. </p>  <p>  Section 38 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for the imposition of such surcharges for the late payment of Local Property Tax. The challenge of compliance is particularly significant for LPT owing to the nature of the tax itself and the wide demographic liable for the tax, a significant proportion of which are not taxpayers to whom the standard collection and enforcement methods could be applied. Compliance is not just about ensuring the submission of returns and the payment of outstanding tax liabilities; there is also a timing aspect to compliance.  Returns must be submitted and payments must be made by a specified date(s).  The suggestion in the Deputy's question, of reducing a penalty to nil following the late submission of returns or payments, would only serve to incentivise such late submission. Likewise, as outlined in my previous response, a surcharge is designed to act as a deterrent and, when there is a late compliance, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability: this considered a fair and proportionate deterrent given the size of LPT liabilities.  </p>  <p>  In relation to comparisons between the treatment of PAYE workers and the self-employed, unlike self-employed taxpayers, PAYE taxpayers are not generally required to submit an annual income tax return. Therefore, it is not possible to impose a surcharge on PAYE taxpayers for failure to submit a return on time. Revenue&rsquo;s compliance actions are tailored according to the type of taxpayer involved and the most effective way to ensure compliance. This is illustrated by the use of the facility to collect LPT liabilities through mandatory deduction at source from a PAYE taxpayer&rsquo;s salary or pension, which is considered to be a fair approach in the context of the surcharge on income tax that can apply to self-employed taxpayers who fail to meet their LPT liabilities.  Moreover, all taxpayers who fail to submit an LPT return, or who submit an incorrect LPT return, are liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that would be payable with a correct return, subject to a maximum penalty of &euro;3,000.</p>  <p>  Adding  the LPT liability to a self-employed person&rsquo;s income tax liability, as the Deputy suggests, would not, of itself, ensure that the LPT was actually paid. This would not be a similar treatment to a PAYE taxpayer who has no choice about when, or how much of, his or her LPT liability is paid, where deduction at source by the employer or pension provider is made mandatory.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the vast majority of property owners pay their LPT on time. There is no reason for property owners to put themselves in a position where they become liable to a surcharge.  If an individual has particular financial circumstances which cause difficulties in meeting his or her LPT liability, he or she may be entitled to a deferral of the tax or may avail of one of a number of payment methods to discharge the liability evenly over the course of the year. </p></reply>

The implementation of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  </p>  <p>  The main findings of the Report, which have been accepted by Government, include:</p>  <p>  - An increase of 10% in the Military Service Allowance which is a unique payment to the Defence Forces and paid to the majority of ranks. The overall annual estimated cost of this measure is &euro;4.8m p.a. </p>  <p>  - Restoration of a 10% reduction in respect of duty allowances such as Security Duty Allowance and Patrol Duty Allowance that were introduced under the Haddington Road Agreement.  The 10% cuts to overseas allowances will also be restored.  The overall estimated cost of the restoration of these measures is &euro;3.3m p.a.</p>  <p>  - Restoration of premium weekend payment rates which were approximately halved under the Haddington Road Agreement. The annual estimated cost of this measure is &euro;1.4m p.a.</p>  <p>  - Restoration of the Pilots Service Commitment Scheme for Flying Officers which is aimed at attracting pilots to continue in service on being able to stand down from the Air Corps. This Scheme was withdrawn in 2010.  The cost of this measurE is estimated at &euro;600k pa depending on take up.</p>  <p>  A high level plan for the implementation of all of the recommendations in the Report has been approved and work will commence on the actions in the plan immediately.  The above measures are in addition to the current Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) which is currently delivering pay benefits of between 7.4% and 6.2% (or up to 10% for new entrants hired after 2012) for our public servants, including Defence Force personnel at a cost of over &euro;1.1bn, out to 2021.  The Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations on the Defence Forces taken together with the pay measures provided for under the PSSA, represent a tangible package of pay improvements at this time for the members of our Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Public pay has been, and continues to be, determined in a public service wide context in Ireland and in a collective bargaining context under the framework of successive public service agreements.  This is appropriate given the size of the Irish public service and in the interests of maintaining control of the public finances.   There are no plans to change these arrangements. </p></reply>

A number of measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure and budgetary targets are being achieved on an ongoing basis. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Fiscal Monitor.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-August 2019 was &euro;42,015 million. This is &euro;262 million, or 0.6% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;38,653 million, is &euro;132 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-August. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;3,362 million, is &euro;130 million, or 3.7% below profile and up &euro;683 million, or 25.5% on the same period last year. The end-September Fiscal monitor will be published later this week.</p>  <p>  Due to the scale of Government expenditure, over &euro;66 billion in aggregate for 2019, and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons. This includes in-year policy decisions, timing issues, overspends in particular areas and the need to respond to emerging events where Departments do not have scope to deliver offsetting savings.</p>  <p>  Looking at policy decisions that would require a Supplementary Estimate, this would include the decision in relation to this year&rsquo;s Social Welfare Christmas Bonus.  Turning to  areas where there are potential pressures that would give rise to overspends, as outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, there are particular challenges in the area of Health taking into account the year-on-year increase and the expenditure profile for the last quarter of the year, and also in Justice arising from pressures in relation to Asylum Seekers Accommodation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the continued uncertainty in relation to the timing of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union has required that the impacted Departments and Offices incur expenditure to ensure that we are in a position to respond to the emerging position. To the extent that offsetting underspends are not available this would necessitate certain Supplementary Estimates.</p>  <p>  At this stage in the year, it is too early to definitively state what the requirement for Supplementary Estimates will be at year-end. The White Paper to be published this Friday will set out the aggregate forecast expenditure outturn for the year taking into account an assessment of potential Supplementary Estimate requirements.   Expenditure Report 2020, which will be published on Budget Day, will set out an initial assessment on a Vote Group basis of any necessary additional expenditure for 2019. </p>  <p>  Turning to the question of particularly sensitive areas that may require additional resources in the coming year, in light of the current position in relation to the UK's exit from the EU, Budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit. Underlying this decision is the need to ensure the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of the Brexit challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. This strategy involves a &lsquo;twin-track&rsquo; approach of providing funding for key public services and also supporting the sectors and regions most exposed to Brexit related disruption. </p>  <p>  Maintaining sustainable expenditure policy is an important element of meeting our EU obligations in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal policy more generally. This includes ensuring that we are achieving the greatest possible impact with public expenditure and delivering high quality public services in an efficient and effective manner. A range of reforms have been put in place over the last number of years with the aim of focusing attention on achieving value for money. For example, the Performance Budgeting initiative seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure. </p>  <p>  My Department has also just come to the end of year three of this phase of the Spending Review process. The Spending Review aims to place evidence at the centre of policy development, through the examination of existing policies and programmes to assess their efficiency and effectiveness. This systematic examination of existing expenditure can support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities. A number of papers resulting from the review process were published over the summer, with the remainder due to be published alongside the Expenditure Report on Budget Day. </p>  <p>  Over the last number of years, maintaining sustainable expenditure policy has also been crucial in restoring our economy following the economic crisis. Following a period of consolidation, the last number of years have seen moderate, sustainable expenditure growth on an annual basis. The Government has prioritised spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity whilst making incremental and sustainable improvements in public services. The steady growth in expenditure in recent years reflects the significant effort made by this Government to moderate the level of expenditure increases and to secure a sustainable long-term path to growth.</p></reply>

Compared to the end 2014 outturn, gross voted expenditure in 2019 is profiled to be 25% higher as set out in section 2.2 of the Budget 2019 Expenditure Report. Indeed, in 2019, &euro;66.6 billion has been allocated to gross voted expenditure. In absolute terms this is higher than the outturn of just over &euro;63 billion in 2009. Recent increases in voted expenditure have been significantly more modest than what was seen in the pre-consolidation period, with gross voted expenditure growing by nearly 55% between 2004 and 2009, while ensuring that the standards of Ireland's public services continue to improve. </p>  <p>  This Government has delivered budgetary strategies based on steady increases in public expenditure underpinned by stable and predictable tax revenue.

The unwinding process is progressively weighted towards those at the lower levels of pay (who will see their salaries increase relative to 2008), and is implemented on a phased basis.</p><p>By end 2019, salary rates up to &euro;50,000 will be fully restored. By end 2020, salary rates up to &euro;70,000 (over 90% of the public service) will be fully restored.</p><p>For public servants who have not achieved full restoration of the FEMPI reductions by October 2020 (i.e the date of the last PSSA increase), restoration of the amount must be completed by way of Ministerial order. This order must be made on the following dates:</p><p>For those with a post - PSSA salary of under &euro;150,000:</p><p>- Covered public servants: a date after 1 October 2020 but before 1 July 2021. </p><p>For those with a post - PSSA salary in excess of &euro;150,000:</p><p>- Covered public servants: a date after 1 October 2020 but before 1 July 2022.  </p><p>Under the terms of the FEMPI Act 2013, I am obliged to carry out an annual review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the FEMPI Acts, having regard to the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness. In this annual review, I am also to consider whether or not any of the provision of the relevant Acts continue to be necessary having regard to the purposes of those Acts, the revenues of the State and State commitments in respect of public service pay and pensions.</p><p>In my 2019 annual review, a written report of which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 26th June, I recommended the continuation of the unwinding of the FEMPI measures in line with the terms agreed under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 &ndash; 2020 and provisions enacted in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. </p></reply>

Two notable examples are the establishment of a centralised Office of Government Procurement with responsibility (together with the key sectors of Health, Defence, Education and Local Government) for sourcing goods and services on behalf of the Public Service, and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, established to lead the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy in cooperation with departments and agencies across the Public Service. The Deputy can be assured that public service reform remains an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy to enable us to continue to improve outcomes for the public. </p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 &ndash; the current phase of public service reform, which became operational during 2018 &ndash; represents a whole-of-public-service initiative designed to build on previous reforms, while expanding the scope of reform to focus on collaboration, innovation and evaluation. Our Public Service 2020 seeks better outcomes for the public, to support innovation and collaboration and to build public service organisations that are resilient and agile. </p>  <p>  A Public Service Leadership Board (PSLB) has been established to lead the delivery of Our Public Service 2020. For the first time, both civil and public service leaders and managers will work jointly to drive the reform programme. This will ensure there is shared ownership for the actions on reform right across the public service.</p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 also contains an added focus on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture and in developing indicators to support an outcomes focus. With this goal in mind, within my Department we have established a Reform Evaluation Unit to focus on monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of reform as well as creating greater links between expenditure and reform.</p>  <p>  Further details on the progress that we have already made will be available in the first progress report on Our Public Service 2020, which I will publish very shortly in conjunction with my colleague Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, and information and up-dates on the full range of OPS2020 activities can also be accessed at the website OPS2020.gov.ie from mid-October. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is sustainable and that Public Sector policy continues to facilitate good economic performance in the future. There are a number of budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews. The actions in Our Public Service 2020 will also ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services over the coming years, without impacting negatively on economic performance.</p></reply>

The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.  </p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents/guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.</p><p>My Department has no role either in making or deciding on enrolment applications to schools or keeping waiting lists. In these matters, schools are required to adhere to the requirements of relevant legislation and the policies of my department. </p><p>Where there is no school placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, funding for the provision of home tuition is available to Parents as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. The availability of a school placement is assessed by the local SENO having regard the relevant diagnosis and relevant professional report. </p><p>As this question relates to a particular child, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply.</p></reply>

Increased levels of lifelong learning will ensure that those in the workforce, and outside the workforce, are supported to take advantage of these developments.</p>  <p>  The National Strategy for Higher Education (2010) and the National Skills Strategy (2016) were published to ensure that the education system is appropriately structured to meet the challenges of this rapid rate of change and facilitate ongoing upskilling and reskilling of the workforce.  </p>  <p>  The higher education system is delivering programmes in a more flexible manner than before. There were 7,967 remote enrolments and 40,101 part-time enrolments in the higher education system in the 2017/2018 academic year.  An increase of 70% in remote enrolments and 12% in part time enrolments over four years.  </p>  <p>  The private higher education ranking systems, of which there are many, each monitor different aspects of international higher education institutions.  The systems award different weightings to various components of the area under review.  </p>  <p>  The outcome of the rankings in any particular year therefore not only depend on how an individual institution has performed, but also on how it has performed in relation to all other institutions under review.  </p>  <p>  In the context of overall system performance progression and excellence, the fulfilment of specific broader Government policies may also impact on rankings.  For example, national policy on Initial Teacher Education (ITE) saw the incorporation of a number of smaller teacher training colleges in Mater Dei, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Drumcondra and CICE into Dublin City University in accordance with recommendations by the Report of the International Review Panel on the Structure of ITE Provision in Ireland (2012 Sahlberg Report). </p>  <p>  This beneficial policy objective increased the proportions of undergraduate students in the university, which, in turn, impacted negatively on the Universty&rsquo;s ranking in some systems. This reflects the narrow and distorting views which can be encapsulated in university ranking methodologies.</p>  <p>  The European Commission fund a ranking system (U-multirank) which focuses on the needs of students and end users, producing summaries of specific areas of interest (where measures are rated from &lsquo;very good&rsquo; to &lsquo;weak&rsquo;) rather than a blunt ranking number, this provides a more accurate view of how institutions are improving/changing year on year.</p></reply>

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.</p><p>No school has lost a full special education teaching post as a result of the re profiling process.</p><p>There  has also been be no reduction to the overall number of special education teaching posts within the school system. There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. </p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy has 20 special education teaching hours, or 0.8 of a special education teacher post, for an enrolment of 83 pupils at the time the profile was developed.</p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools on their website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>Schools were advised that the appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019. An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>The NCSE wrote to schools on 31st May, 2019 to advise them of the outcome of the appeals. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts, in accordance with these criteria, will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>This process will recommence in the coming weeks.</p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

Where the number of applications from non-eligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, tickets are allocated using a random selection process.   </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the scheme, the number of spare seats varies from year to year, based on the capacity of the buses running on all of the various routes and the number of eligible children accommodated on each route. Hence there is no guarantee that a non-eligible child who received a place in a previous year will receive a seat the following year.  It is included in the terms and conditions on the Bus &Eacute;ireann online application that availability of seats may vary from year to year and that concessionary transport cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is not attending their nearest post-primary centre and is therefore not eligible for transport.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that the service in question is operating to capacity.</p></reply>

Schools should consider how best to support any additional needs in the context of the Continuum of Support if appropriate.

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,953 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen either in the context of any pay review mechanism agreed by the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement, or in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring.</p></reply>

The precise nature of the arrangements have to be considered by each school having regards to the particular circumstances  in question including factors such as the numbers of children involved, the ages of those children and the availability of staff and physical space in the school concerned.  </p>  <p>  The Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector (2012) acknowledged that denominational religious education, including faith formation and sacramental preparation are long-established features of the primary system. With regard to denominational religious education in primary schools, the Forum&rsquo;s Report did not recommend that it be removed from the school day.  </p>  <p>  However, the Advisory Group had concerns about the amount of time which can be devoted to sacramental preparation in some schools and they recommended that it should not be allowed to encroach on time allocated for the general curriculum.  They also recommended on-going discussion with parents and clergy in this regard. </p>  <p>  Multi-denominational schools, such as Community National Schools, teach a multi-belief and values curriculum, which is inclusive of all children. In such schools, faith formation and preparation for religious sacraments takes place outside of school hours.</p></reply>

These necessitate a collaborative approach to policing with law enforcement agencies north and south of the border. </p><p>In November 2015, the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the agreement <i>A Fresh Start, The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan</i>, as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.  These measures included the creation of the Joint Agency Task Force. </p><p>Both Governments are determined that, regardless of the political outcome of Brexit, the excellent ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland must and will continue to combat the threat posed by dissidents and criminals that seek to exploit the policing challenges posed by the border.</p><p>Last week, I attended the 17th Annual Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime in Co. Cavan, aimed at enhancing cooperation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, particularly in relation to cross border organised criminality and related issues. I met with the Permanent Secretary of the Northern Ireland Department of Justice, the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI in the margins of this conference, where we discussed matters relating to security in the border region, both now and in the context of Brexit. </p><p>I recently spoke to the Home Secretary and have also met the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I can assure the Deputy that I took these opportunities to reaffirm our deep commitment to continuing the close working relationship that we have with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and we discussed matters including security and risks in the Border region.  </p><p>It is also important to note that the Garda Commissioner recently made an operational decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit (ASU) in Cavan which became operational this week.  It will complement the work of the Units nationwide, including those in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth in the Northern Region.  </p><p>The Northern region also continues to benefit from the accelerated recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, supported by the unprecedented level of Government funding to the organisation.  Garda strength in the Northern Region has increased to approximately 1,500, an increase of 150 Garda&iacute; since the end of 2017.  These Garda&iacute; are supported by approximately 150 Garda staff in the region, which represents an increase of almost 30% over the past 3 years, which means that additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect.</p><p>Requirements in the region will in the usual way be kept under ongoing review by Garda management. In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, I understand from the Commissioner that further resources can and will be provided as needed.</p></reply>

Indeed the first message developed through the work of the forum has also been produced. This message relates to marking personal property for ease of recovery and return in the event of theft or burglary and it is due to be circulated imminently, via email to the combined reach of the Forum, consisting of over 1 million households nationwide. </p>  <p>  There will also be a nationwide engagement day in hundreds of locations on Friday 22   November 2019. The full details of this day are still being finalised, but it is certain tobe a great opportunity for members of the public to meet with their local community Garda, who will be able to discuss issues of local concern and offer practical crime prevention advice.</p>  <p>  It is not currently envisaged that the Forum will incur significant costs going forward; however, should this change, my Department will re-examine funding of the Forum as the situation calls for it. </p>  <p>  The National Rural Safety Forum is an initiative which I am delighted to support, as Minister for Justice and Equality.

The offer of accommodation and related services to applicants is just that - an offer. There is no obligation on any applicant to accept that offer and there is no restriction on their freedom of movement throughout the State. Some applicants choose to stay with friends or family who are already living in the State or to source and provide for their own private accommodation if they have independent means. </p>  <p>  Applicants who have been granted a labour market access permission and are employed or in self-employment now have the economic independence to allow them to make further choices regarding their accommodation situation. To date, the Minister for Justice and Equality has granted over 3,100 labour market access permissions. </p>  <p>  International protection applicants have a temporary permission to remain in the State while their application is being examined and are therefore ineligible for social housing supports like HAP.  </p>  <p>  There are, however, approximately 850 people with an international protection status or a permission to remain who continue to reside in our accommodation centres. These people are no longer applicants and are no longer in the international protection process. They have the same right to housing assistance and supports as Irish nationals and EEA citizens. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department does not record how many of these people have applied for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). People with status or permission to remain seeking accommodation in the wider community can choose to apply for HAP, or they may wish to use other means to pay for their accommodation.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged DePaul Ireland, the Jesuit Refugee Service and the Peter McVerry Trust to provide assistance to them to find accommodation. Information supplied to us by these organisations indicates that most people who find accommodation are availing of the HAP.  In addition, my Department is working with other Government Departments, local authorities and the City and County Managers&rsquo; Association to help these people to transition to longer-term accommodation in the community.</p></reply>

The permission is renewable until there is a final decision on their protection application.  Eligible applicants have access to all sectors of employment, with the exception of the Civil and Public Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Irish Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) of my Department that as of 26 September 2019, there are a total of 7,355 persons residing in accommodation provided by IPAS.  This represents an overall increase of 1,827 persons from the date of the signing of the The European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018.  </p>  <p>  In this regard the Deputy may wish to note that direct provision services are offered to those who come to Ireland and apply for international protection (asylum). These services are demand led and generally it is difficult to predict demand far in advance. Therefore, it is not possible to link the introduction of the right to work for protection applicants with any change in the number of adults or families living in direct provision centres, as application numbers are impacted by a number of factors, including international developments.</p></reply>

This was the biggest reform to the system in twenty years and it introduced a single application procedure where all aspects of a person's application (refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain) are examined and determined in one process. Prior to this, the three strands were examined sequentially and this could lead to long delays in obtaining a final decision.</p>  <p>  Upon the commencement of the 2015 Act, approximately 3,500 legacy cases were carried over to be dealt with under the new single application procedure (1,500 of these cases were from the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and 2,000 from the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal).  A further 500 cases transitioned in the months following commencement.  These cases would have been the longest in the system at the commencement of the Act.  </p>  <p>  The International Protection Office (IPO) committed to scheduling these legacy cases for interview by the end of 2018 and for completion by the end of Q2 2019, where possible.</p>  <p>  The IPO achieved the first part of this commitment in 2018 by scheduling all transition cases for interview, where it was possible to do so. The vast majority of the legacy cases have now been processed to completion in the IPO, and the focus is now on post commencement single procedure cases.  </p>  <p>  Some legacy cases will continue to be dealt with including transition applicants who have not co-operated up to this point and are now re-engaging with the process, applicants who have come back into the process through Judicial Review, or for other reasons.  These cases are prioritised and scheduled for interview at the earliest possible opportunity and processed accordingly.</p>  <p>  New applicants arriving today at the International Protection Office (IPO), who complete their questionnaire, are being scheduled for interview as follows: </p>  <p>  - for prioritised applications, within 5 months of application; and</p>  <p>  - for non-prioritised applications, within 8 to 10 months. </p>  <p>  Prioritised cases include applicants from refugee generating countries like Syria or Eritrea or from especially vulnerable groups like unaccompanied minors.  </p>  <p>  The IPO target is to issue its recommendation within 8 weeks after the interview.  This is, however, dependent on the complexity of the case. The overall median processing time for applications processed under the International Protection Act 2015 to end August 2019 is 15.7 months with prioritised cases being processed in 8.7 months.</p>  <p>  Processing times are being monitored on an ongoing basis and the IPO continue to work on means to further improve them. The aim is to reduce processing times for first instance recommendations to 9 months.</p></reply>

This process has involved my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities. </p>  <p>  On foot of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it was agreed by all attendees at the last meeting of the group that, in the main, current legislative provisions appeared to be sufficient. Nonetheless it was also agreed that the group would remain open to considering workable legislative solutions to any specific legislative gaps specifically identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  My officials wrote to the Garda Commissioner to seek his formal views on the matter. A response was received on 28 June and has since been shared with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as a primary contributor to the work of the cross-agency group. The response from the Office of the Garda Commissioner does suggest potential legislative changes which the organisation believes could assist in improving policing in this area.</p>  <p>  These proposals are receiving detailed consideration in my Department and it is expected that the cross-agency group will reconvene shortly to further scrutinise these proposals and to ascertain whether they can be progressed alongside targeted enforcement measures, awareness raising and youth engagement, which will be key to success in combatting this behaviour.</p></reply>

Accordingly, fireworks can only be imported into the country under licence and stored and sold in accordance with explosives law.  </p><p>I am satisfied that the current law in Ireland governing the use of fireworks is particularly robust. </p><p>As Deputies may be aware, fireworks are classified into four separate categories, depending on their level of hazard and whether they require specialist knowledge for use.  Category F1 is the least hazardous category and covers party poppers and sparklers, while Category F4 represents the most hazardous.</p><p>In the interests of safety and security, it is Government policy to restrict the availability of the more hazardous fireworks to the general public - including categories F2, F3 and F4.  A licence is required to import fireworks in any of these categories. </p><p>I can further confirm that licences under the Explosives Act are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators. </p><p>Under Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, it is an offence:</p><p>-for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence,</p><p>-to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, and</p><p>-to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</p><p>Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 also gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks.  </p><p>The penalties provided for in connection with these offences are very severe.  Having unlicensed fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply can result in a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment. Igniting fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalty. </p><p>More generally, the Deputy may also be interested to know that each year, as Halloween approaches, special efforts are made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</p><p>To complement this added Garda attention, my Department also runs an annual advertising campaign in the run-up to Halloween, highlighting the illegality of fireworks as well public safety aspects of their use. This campaign will be launched in the coming weeks in print media as well as online, including on social media platforms.</p></reply>

This is a major landmark piece of reforming legislation which provides for the establishment, for the first time, of a Judicial Council comprising all members of the judiciary. The primary function of the Council will be to promote and maintain excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions and high standards of conduct among judges. The Board of the Council will be responsible for carrying out the functions of the Council on a day-to-day basis. </p>  <p>  I envisage that the Judicial Council will be established by the end of this year and a great deal of work is underway to facilitate establishment within that time frame.

These provisions concern the appointment of the interim Secretary to the Council, and the process of identifying and recommending to the Government, persons who are suitable for appointment to be lay members of the Sentencing Guidelines and Information Committee, the Judicial Conduct Committee and panels of inquiry. The membership of other Committees such as the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee does not include lay members.</p>  <p>  The commencement of these provisions will enable the Council to commence its work on establishment day and the Committees of the Council to undertake their functions within the time frames specified in the Act. </p>  <p>  Committees of the Council will be established by the Council having regard to the timelines set out in the Act. The Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee is to be established no later than 3 months after the first meeting of the Judicial Council itself, and that Committee is to meet no later than one month after its establishment.  </p></reply>

The Deputy should be aware that I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no responsibility or influence as regards such matters. The regulation of private health insurance is solely a matter for the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), which is the statutory regulator of the private health insurance market in the State. </p><p>I can advise the Deputy that it has always been the case that students seeking an immigration permission to reside in the State must prove that they have sufficient finances to support themselves without recourse to State funds. This includes the necessity to provide proof of individual private health insurance or medical insurance as part of a group insurance scheme operated by the college/school or travel insurance. This would provide the student with adequate medical insurance cover in Ireland.</p><p>I understand that the High Court judgment provides that private medical insurance for non-EEA nationals, who are considered  as being ordinarily resident in the State for the purpose of the Health Insurance Act 1994, are, as a result of the judgment, subject to the principle of community-rating. In this regard, while the judgment changes the requirements for the way private medical insurance is operated for non-EEA nationals, it does not, in itself, change immigration policy and the requirements for non-EEA students wishing to study in Ireland.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that there is an appeal pending on the judgment and as a result it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on matters that are before the Courts and therefore sub judice. </p><p>However, officials of my Department have had ongoing contact with the relevant officials in the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills to discuss issues relevant to the judgment.

Our business target for processing short-stay 'C' visas is within eight weeks  and current processing time in Dublin for most types of short-stay visas is around four weeks.  The processing time an individual visa at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times for individual applications inevitably vary as a result.  </p>  <p>  I am also advised by the Immigration Service  that the visa service is experiencing an increase in the number of visa applications across most categories, in line with increased economic activity generally.  Notwithstanding this, processing times are on a par with, and in many cases, better than the same period last year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to keep processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.  This has included the assignment of additional staff to deal with applications, and more generally the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  The position in this regard is being kept under review.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department, by e-mail, using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is a child&ndash;centred Act which addresses the rights of children to legal security, to the care of their parents and important adults in their lives, and to equality before the law.  The reforms in family law provided for in that Act recognise the crucial role of parents and the need for a child to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents.  </p>  <p>  Married parents of a child are automatically joint guardians and have joint custody of their children. Where married parents separate or divorce, they can decide between themselves on custody arrangements for their children or apply to the courts to decide on the matter. If the father is not married to the mother of the child, he will not automatically become a guardian of the child. The issue of automatic guardianship was considered during the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Bill through the Oireachtas. However, the automatic extension of guardianship to a father who is not involved and is not participating in his child&rsquo;s life would have consequences for the child and the child&rsquo;s mother, for example, if he does not consent to the issue of a passport or to the placement of a child for adoption. </p>  <p>  There are provisions in place to facilitate non-marital fathers who have an ongoing relationship with their children to become guardians of their children. Section 2(4A) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as inserted by section 43(c) of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) now provides for joint guardianship by a man who was not married to the mother of the child and was cohabiting with the mother for not less than 12 consecutive months. This 12 month period must include a period, occurring at any time after the birth of the child, of not less than 3 months during which both the mother and father have lived with the child. In addition, a father who is not married to the child's mother and does not satisfy the cohabitation requirements may become a guardian if the parents jointly make a statutory declaration appointing him as a guardian. It is also open to the father at any stage to make an application to court for guardianship of the child under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Article 42A.4 of the Constitution requires that provision be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings concerning the guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child in such proceedings.  These factors include the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with each of his or her parents.  The courts shall have regard to all of these factors or circumstances that it regards as being relevant to the child concerned and his or her family and make its decision accordingly.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that either parent of a child, whether or not he or she is also a guardian of the child, may apply to court for a direction regarding the custody of a child or the right of access to the child.  Section 11D of the 1964 Act obliges the court in proceedings under section 11 to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with each of his or her parents on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  Section 25 of the 1964 Act also requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in guardianship, custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  </p>  <p>  Section 12A of the 1964 Act (inserted by section 58 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that in making any order under the Act, the court may impose such conditions as it considers to be necessary in the best interests of the child.  It is a matter for the courts when making orders under the 1964 Act in relation to matters such as the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child to determine the best interests of the child and to consider whether or not any conditions should be attached to such orders.  </p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 made provision to assist parents who need to return to court because the other parent has breached a court order in relation to custody of, or access to, a child. Section 56 of the 2015 Act inserted a new section 18A into the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  This provides that where a parent or guardian of a child has been granted custody of or access to the child under the 1964 Act, but he or she has been unreasonably denied such custody or access by another guardian or parent, that person may apply to court for an enforcement order.  </p>  <p>  Court orders in relation to guardianship, custody and access are of course a matter for the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.</p></reply>

A number of other relevant bodies, including the National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also involved in operational activity where appropriate. The objective of the Task Force is to build on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational law enforcement actions.</p><p>The Strategic Oversight Group of the Task Force is jointly chaired at senior management level by the two police services, to provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.  This group also includes senior personnel from relevant agencies.  As a multi-agency coordination structure, the Task Force does not have a separate staffing complement or budget. Personnel from the participating agencies in both jurisdictions are assigned for specific operations and other capacities from the relevant agencies are deployed as required by operational demands.</p><p>The Task Force has made strong progress in tackling cross-border criminal activity across a range of crime areas.  These include not just traditional smuggling activities, but also rural and farm crimes, organised burglary and drug crime. </p><p>The multi-agency nature of the Task Force is critical to its success. It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, as well as specific joint investigations which take place when individual crime incidents with a cross border dimension occur, such as the one underway into a recent horrific case of abduction and assault. </p><p>Last week, together with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, senior officers from all the agencies and senior officials from Department of Justice Northern Ireland and my own Department, I attended the 17th Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime in Co. Cavan.  This is an annual event, aimed at enhancing cooperation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, particularly in relation to cross border organised criminality and related issues.  Operational members of the Task Force came together at the conference, which provided an opportunity to consider in detail the necessary improvements and innovations, including international co-operation. While the work of the Task Force is reviewed as part of the annual cross border conference on organised crime, there is ongoing multiagency engagement in relation to operations to tackle cross border crime.</p></reply>

However, the primary television companies in this regard are not based in this jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I have no statutory function in regard to the selling of replica shirts or the sponsors mentioned thereon.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-01a.618.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100100069#WRL04800"><p>Approximately 95% of all penalty point offences are endorsed by the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) on driver licences every year.  This is an exceptional rate of endorsement. </p>  <p>  Over 85% of penalty point offence records are received directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, when the offender opts to pay the fixed charge amount and accept the penalty points. The remainder - the minority - are received from the Courts Service, following convictions. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am acutely aware of the road traffic enforcement challenges that result from the non-surrender of driving licences.</p>  <p>  In the case of roadside intercept detections, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can record the driving licence details obtained at the point of interception. This can ultimately be used to apply penalty points, should there be a conviction. In such instances, the recording of a licence in court may not be necessary. </p>  <p>  However, an issue may still arise where the licence details are not obtained at the point of interception.  For example, in the case of non-intercept speed camera detections, the registration of the vehicle is captured on detection.  If a driver does not pay his/her Fixed Charge Notice and is subsequently convicted, his/her licence details should be recorded in Court in accordance with section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 2016.  Unfortunately, there are instances when the Court is unable to record licence details, for example when licences are reported to the Court as lost or forgotten, or where persons are convicted of speeding while also driving without a licence.  There are also some drivers who wilfully choose not to attend Court and are convicted in absentia. Again, there is no licence to record in these cases. </p>  <p>  In cases where a licence is not provided, I understand that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has the facility, in certain instances, to look up the National Vehicle and Driver File and successfully apply penalty points, based on exact matching against the offence's vehicle registration details.</p>  <p>  I can also confirm to the Deputy that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority, the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na met in August to discuss road traffic enforcement and that the non-production of driving licences was one of the matters discussed at this meeting. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS)) Working Group, chaired by officials from both my Department and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and attended by the Courts Service among other agencies, actively monitors progress and relevant developments in the area of road traffic enforcement. I have asked my officials to meet with Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Courts Service via this forum to discuss how the process of obtaining driver information upon conviction is currently operating under section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 2016. The Working Group will meet during October and I can confirm to the Deputy that this important enforcement issue will be discussed. I am happy to update the Deputy further after the appropriate meeting has taken place.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the Master Licence Record programme, established by Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is implementing further measures to assist in endorsement of penalty points by matching vehicle and driver records on the NVDF. This project will go some way to addressing the issue of 'unmatched offences' by matching vehicle and driver records on the NVDF, and, over time, by establishing owner identity for all vehicle records. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Shane Ross, T.D., who has responsibility for road traffic legislation that, due to legislative and operational issues, full population of the Master Licence Record Programme is likely to take several years.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to acknowledge that there will be always be complex scenarios when attempting to endorse driving licences in respect of road traffic offences; for example, instances where the vehicle owner is not driving at the time of an offence, or when an offending vehicle is owned by a company. It is equally important to note that disqualified drivers constitute a major component of those who do not surrender driving licences. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be aware that Minister Ross has proposed the amendment of section 40 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 to remove the existing Garda discretion to allow a driver 10 days in which to produce his/her licence/learner permit at a Garda station and, as a result, to provide for the mandatory carry of licence/permit. This proposal will be discussed further over the coming period. </p></reply>

Complexities may also arise at local level, for example a client living in County Limerick may choose to apply for legal aid to Ennis Law Centre.

This Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants. Article 21 of the Directive requires Member States, in implementing the Directive, to take into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons, and Article 22 provides for the assessment of the special reception needs of vulnerable persons.</p>  <p>  Ireland transposed the Directive by way of the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018. While there is no formal procedure in place for vulnerability assessments, Regulation 8 refers to vulnerable persons and provides for an assessment in relation to an applicant's special reception needs within 30 days of presentation or application.  </p>  <p>  Every applicant has an initial interview conducted when they first attend the International Protection Office in Dublin. If the applicant indicates that they require accommodation , he or she will then be assessed for any specific reception needs. The result of the assessment is taken into account when assigning accommodation to the individual. </p>  <p>  Applicants are also invited for an initial health assessment on a voluntary basis. A Health Screening Team, which is funded and managed by the HSE, is located onsite at the Balseskin Reception Centre for this purpose. The team comprises of GPs, a Medical Officer, a Clinical Nurse Specialist and two nurses, a primary care social worker, two primary care psychologists and clerical/administration support. The team offers a range of individual services and screening for medical and psychosocial needs and makes onward referrals for any further treatment required. These health professionals communicate with my officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS - formerly RIA), within the bounds of patient confidentiality, if a particular need is identified that will impact the person's accommodation requirements. In the coming weeks, a new primary care facility will be opening in Balseskin, which will enable the health care team to provide their services in a facility that is to the standard of all new HSE primary care facilities. </p>  <p>  In addition, arrangements are in place with Safetynet, who carry out health screening in various parts of the country on behalf of the HSE, to offer the screening service to those who do not, for whatever reason, avail of it in Dublin. Staff from Safetynet liaise with the IPAS if the person is deemed vulnerable on medical or related grounds. This can include a request that special arrangements should be taken regarding the assignment of the person's accommodation, for example if they need to be located near a particular hospital. </p>  <p>  My Department is continually reviewing how to improve services to applicants and my officials are currently examining the options available for putting in place a formal procedure for the identification and assessment of those applicants deemed to be vulnerable in accordance with Article 21 of the Reception Conditions Directive.</p>  <p>  To assist in determining how best we can meet the health and related needs of applicants, the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has recently commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving our existing processes. I look forward to the outcome of this research.</p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that all Departments and their agencies involved in the delivery of services and supports to applicants have a role to play in identifying and addressing the needs of applicants who present as vulnerable. This is particularly the case where vulnerabilities may only be disclosed or become evident after the initial stage of the protection process.  </p>  <p>  For the purposes of the Directive and Regulation 8 of the 2018 Regulations, vulnerable persons include minors, unaccompanied minors, disabled people, elderly people, pregnant women, single parents, victims of human trafficking, persons with serious illnesses, persons with mental disorders and persons who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence, such as victims of female genital mutilation.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>I would point out however that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p><p>The Deputy will be interested to note that a new &ldquo;Community Policing Framework&rdquo; is currently at an advanced stage. I understand that this new Framework will take into account the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI), under which it is envisaged that community policing may be a specialism in some urban areas. In rural areas, community policing may be more of a hybrid model whereby all Garda&iacute; in a District have a community responsibility but also attend to normal policing duties.</p><p>The number of Community Garda&iacute; serving in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31 August 2019, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is 724.</p><p>I think it is also important to note the welcome roll-out of the new operating model of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This meets a key commitment in <i>A Policing Service for the Future, </i>the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. </p><p>The Garda Operating Model re-organises resources around the delivery of front-line policing, placing an increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting victims of crime. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in each Division, there will be a dedicated Superintendent leading a community engagement team.  I am confident that this reorganisation will further strengthen community policing and engagement, and provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each Division nationwide.</p></reply>

The programme is an essential part of Government strategy to help tackle youth crime, administered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it is very important that it operates effectively. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, serious issues arose in relation to the handling of cases which had been deemed unsuitable for the Garda Youth Diversion Programme.  These issues did not involve any negative implications for the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme itself, which is a valuable mechanism to help young offenders turn away from crime. </p>  <p>  The operation of the programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly supported by a nationwide network of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects, which are funded by my Department and operated by community-based organisations.  The projects receive referrals from a number of sources, but primarily from the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that an expert Steering Group is currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy, including a review of the Children Act. The Steering Group commenced its work in February and has had a series of meetings during this year which will continue into next year. The Group is tasked with advising and guiding the development of the new Strategy, including consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, from early intervention and preventative work, including family support, diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  This lead in timeframe ensures that sufficient staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. There are many complex strands to this preparatory work, including the involvement of multiple organisations.  </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations.  </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016) commenced provisions of the Act to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018). </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on preparing for commencement of the remainder of the 2015 Act. In April 2018, the Mental Health Commission engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service. The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission has also received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff for the Decision Support Service and also a number of staff to provide shared services for the Mental Health Commission and Decision Support Service. These staff are being recruited on a phased basis by the Mental Health Commission.  </p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority is currently finalising its work on the suite of draft codes of practice in relation to non-healthcare matters which are required to be prepared under section 103 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  </p>  <p>  In June 2018, my Department recruited an external legal expert to assist in the preparation of draft regulations in relation to decision-making assistance agreements, co-decision-making agreements, certain matters relating to decision-making representatives, and enduring powers of attorney.  These regulation-making powers are provided for in sections 10(4), 31, 45(3), 45(4), 46(3) and 79 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. Work on the draft regulations is on-going.</p></reply>

Understanding the experience of such victims is important to me as Minister and greatly assists in the development of Government policy in this important area.  And my Department will study the report carefully in that context. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Government has already brought forward a range of new laws in recent years in order to help address domestic violence, as part of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021.</p>  <p>  Central to this is the landmark Domestic Violence Act 2018, which came into force on 1 January of this year.  Other developments in this area include the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which introduced a statutory definition of consent, and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which provides a wide range of measures to protect and inform victims during the progress of their case through the Criminal Justice system.</p>  <p>  In addition, on International Women&rsquo;s Day, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Istanbul Convention (the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence). </p>  <p>  Further, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuously improving its specialist services. Responding to the needs of victims has seen the rolling out by the Garda Commissioner of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs) with specially trained officers responsible for engagement with and interviewing of victims. These Units will support the delivery of a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of sexual and domestic crime.  </p>  <p>  I note that the report referred to also referred to sentencing in this field.  I would point out that the judiciary is independent in matters of sentencing. However the Judicial Council Act 2019 will provide for the development of sentencing guidelines by the judiciary themselves. </p></reply>

INAB was established in 1985. The functions of INAB include the provision of accreditation in accordance with the relevant International Organisation for Standardisation ISO 17000 series of standards and guides.</p>  <p>  INAB is the sole national accreditation body for Ireland as appointed under EU Regulation 765/2008. The provision of the accreditation service for Irish enterprises is managed by the INAB executive and over seen by the INAB Board with the support of externally contracted expertise. INAB acts independently in carrying out its accreditation roles.</p>  <p>  Following the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s in June 2014 INAB became a committee of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA). </p>  <p>  The primary nature of contact between Departmental officials and INAB officials is related to the appointment of Notified Bodies. My Department is the Notifying Authority for the conformity assessment of certain products being placed on the EU internal market. If a Conformity Assessment Body applies to my Department to be appointed as a Notified Body under certain EU Directives (see attached at Appendix 1) then the Department seeks confirmation from INAB officials that the Conformity Assessment Body has received accreditation from INAB. This arises only in relation to accreditation provided by INAB to a Conformity Assessment Body under a specific number of EU Directives and it is in this context that my Department would seek information from INAB on individual accreditations. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the Department has no role in relation to decisions made by INAB as to who should be accredited and/or how the accreditation process should be conducted by INAB as INAB carries out this role independently. </p>  <p>  In addition, officials from my Department have been in regular contact with INAB officials for the last few years in relation to matters concerning accreditation processes in the context of Brexit. INAB officials have participated in a number of publicity events organised by my Department, and other Departments, in order to highlight the potential impact of Brexit on Irish businesses who currently use UK based accreditation services.</p>  <p>  Other interactions between officials from my Departments concerning INAB include interaction with the HSA on the financing and staffing of INAB in the context of the overall operational management and staffing of the HSA. </p>  <p>  INAB is also a member of the Market Surveillance Forum, an inter-Departmental/Agency forum, chaired by my Department, involving all the Market Surveillance Authorities within the State in addition to other relevant stakeholders, this forum meets on a quarterly basis. </p>  <p>  Given the above the Deputy will appreciate it is not possible to account for each individual exchange of correspondence for the period requested by the Deputy in this reply.</p>  <p>  However, if the Deputy has a particular topic in mind, my Department will be pleased to assist him. </p></reply>

I am consistently engaging and listening to the needs of start-ups and established small businesses. </p><p>I am keenly aware of their importance as SMEs account for 99.8% of all enterprises in the State and are predominantly indigenous. My Department through its Agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), provides a range of tailored supports to small and medium enterprises. Supports include access to finance, management development, mentoring supports, business development programmes, market supports and trade promotion. </p><p>Ireland continues to be very supportive of entrepreneurial activity and once again ranks 1<sup>st</sup>in Europe in terms of our entrepreneurs being held in high esteem. The 2018 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor annual index of early stage entrepreneurs indicates that Ireland had increased rates of entrepreneurship in 2018 and holds a position of 5<sup>th</sup>in Europe compared to 6<sup>th</sup>in 2017. Importantly, also reported is that the gap between male and female entrepreneurs has continued to narrow from a previous 2 to 1 ratio to a ratio of 1.6 to 1 in 2018. </p><p>While Ireland has a healthy and positive perception of entrepreneurship, I am cognisant of the need to create and support an environment where our budding entrepreneurs can thrive and succeed. </p><p>That is why in the 2019 Budget I allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;5m to the Local Enterprise Offices.  This extra funding assists our Agencies to reach more of our entrepreneurs and SMEs to help grow and scale their businesses which are at the heart of our economic growth. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s High Potential Start-Up (HPSU) team provides support and advice to entrepreneurs and early stage companies that have an innovative product, service or technology, and the potential to export.</p><p>The 31 LEOs are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other non-financial supports for anyone intending to start or grow their own business. The LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p><p>My Department also runs the www.supportingsmes.gov.ie online portal that enables start-ups and small business to navigate the supports available from all the different government departments, agencies and initiatives. This online tool also advertises upcoming events that would be of interest to entrepreneurs and established SME&rsquo;s such as financial literacy classes or business management workshops. </p><p>To further my commitment to the future growth of our indigenous small and medium enterprises, I commissioned the OECD Review of SME Policies in Ireland in March 2018. </p><p>The aim of the review is to provide tailored analysis and recommendations to my Department and the Irish government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies based on international comparisons. </p><p>This is a collaborative body of work and involves considerable input from Government departments, agencies, representative groups and most importantly, indigenous businesses themselves. This review is currently nearing completion and will be launched with an accompanying SME Strategy Roadmap by myself and the OECD Deputy Secretary General Knudsen on the 23<sup>rd</sup>October 2019. This will assist my Department in developing a SME Strategy which will be part of the Future Jobs Framework. </p><p>I and my Department will continue to hold structured dialogue with key stakeholders and advocate across Government to ensure the needs of SMEs and entrepreneurs are considered in the execution of national policy. </p></reply>

Through the mechanism of the Technical Working Group, Ireland has fully utilised the provisions of the State aid framework to enable the investment by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;74 million in 2018  in Brexit impacted businesses.   Earlier this year, following intense engagement by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, approval was received to provide capital support to Carbery Food Ingredients based in Cork towards financing a large diversification project to mitigate the impacts of Brexit, and further options are being developed to support large food companies.  The work of this Group is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I met with Commissioner Vestager.  The focus of the meeting centred around the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.   It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner's team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implication become known.  I have received assurances from the Commissioner that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p>  <p>  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State aid rules, this will be raised as part of these Working Group discussions.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The RPP aims to boost investment and job creation in the regions through the construction of office and technology buildings in advance of demand for both existing and prospective IDA client companies. This has already helped secure a number of significant investments for regional Ireland and the RPP will remain an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to locate in areas outside of Dublin. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep the IDA's property requirements under review in the time ahead. </p></reply>

Furthermore, many of the newer products being licensed are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. These include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost, the potential or actual budget impact, and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The process for assessing applications works very well where the new medicines have strong evidence of clinical effectiveness and are priced in a cost-effective manner.  Delays in reimbursement decisions for new products do occur in cases where the evidence of clinical effectiveness is weak, and where prices are set well outside of cost effectiveness parameters.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis, it must ensure that the best price is achieved. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 29 new medicines and 5 new uses of existing medicines representing a significant investment by the HSE to provide access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients.  It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next five years.  </p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists. </p>  <p>  Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for Government. In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve access for patients waiting for scheduled care this year.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The HSE advises that this is because there is no evidence that screening would be of any benefit to them. At this stage in life, normal cell changes in the cervix can look very like abnormal cells. If CervicalCheck tested women under 25, changes that are normal might be treated as abnormal and a woman could be sent for treatment when they don't need it. Invasive cervical cancer is also very rare at this age. The HSE advises any woman under 25 who is worried about their risk of developing cervical cancer to speak to their GP. </p>  <p>  This approach is in line with screening programmes in other countries. The UK National Screening Committee recommended in November 2012 that the age of first invitation for cervical screening should be raised to 25 in Wales and Scotland on the basis that there is evidence of a large number of women screened and treated with relatively little benefit below this age. </p>  <p>  Cancer screening is one important aspect of cancer prevention, and another is vaccination. The HPV vaccine protects against the HPV virus which can cause cancer and genital warts in both women and men, and has been offered to girls in their first year of secondary school since 2010. The Deputy may wish to know that, following a positive recommendation from HIQA, that an extension of the HPV vaccination programme to boys would be both clinically and cost effective, as of September this year HPV vaccination is now available to boys in first year of secondary school also.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy,  with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and  the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism  so that existing and potential investors can  make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that  there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs were considered in detail. It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly. </p>  <p>  The NTPF has now completed its report and the Steering Group has completed its consideration of it, the report was recently submitted by the NTPF to the Department. It is now being reviewed by Department officials and any recommendations included in the report will be appraised before publication.</p></reply>

The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in July last, my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development announced CL&Aacute;R funding of &euro;890,632 to 20 voluntary community organisations. This funding will support the purchase and/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues. It will support voluntary organisations that provide:</p>  <p>  - transport for people with significant mobility issues, including those requiring specialised  wheelchair accessible vehicles, to day-care or other medical, therapeutic or respite services; or</p>  <p>  - transport to/from designated cancer treatment hospitals/centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.</p></reply>

The objective of audit and quality review at CervicalCheck was to facilitate continued improvement and ongoing learning within the programme. Following the issues which arose in relation to the non-disclosure of audit findings, a decision was taken to pause the audit. </p>  <p>  The Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Gabriel Scally made a number of recommendations, one of which was that &ldquo;Audit should continue to be an important component of cervical screening as this complies with all good clinical practice. Common, robust and externally validated approaches to the design, conduct, evaluation and oversight of audits should be developed across the screening services.&rdquo; (Recommendation 26).</p>  <p>  As set out in the approved plan for the implementation of Dr Scally's recommendations, the HSE established an Expert Group within the National Screening Service (NSS) to review the clinical audit processes for interval cancers across all screening programmes. This work is ongoing and is expected to be complete by the end of this year, following which its recommendations will be implemented by the National Screening Service.</p></reply>
