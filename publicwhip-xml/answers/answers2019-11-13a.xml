Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils.   </p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products. Based on an expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019.  </p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned. This allowed time for my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. </p>  <p>  Based on this consultation, I introduced a provision in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill applying the reduced rate of VAT (13.5%) to food supplements from 1 January 2020. In the absence of this provision the standard VAT rate of 23% would apply to food supplements, including those that had been concessionally zero rated previously. </p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that certain products will not be impacted by the legislative change.  Foods for specific groups such as infant and follow-on formulae and infant foods, foods for special medical purposes and specially formulated foods will continue to be zero rated as they are well established and defined categories of food. Fortified foods, such as yoghurts and cereals fortified with vitamins and minerals, will also continue to be zero rated as they are food.</p>  <p>  Folic acid, vitamin and mineral products which are licenced or authorised as medicines by the Health Products Regulatory Authority will continue to be zero rated under a different VAT provision for human oral medicines.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-13a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111300059#WRA01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 75 together.</p>  <p>  At the outset, the Deputies should note that the Minister for Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, the Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products as these matters are of a commercial nature and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  However, as the Deputy is aware, in my role as the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, I have raised the issue of dual pricing with the Central Bank at a recent meeting and sought their views.  In response, the Central Bank has confirmed that they will undertake a review of price optimisation, which includes the practice of dual pricing, as this has been identified as a potential consumer risk by the Central Bank in its sectoral risk assessment of the insurance sector.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the first step of this review will be a comprehensive data gathering and analysis exercise to determine the scale and prevalence of price optimisation across the insurance sector and its precise effects on consumer groups.  I also understand that the Central Bank intends to engage with key stakeholders, most notably the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, on the terms of reference of this review and on the nature and scope of any potential remedies.  It is the Central Bank&rsquo;s intention that the data gathering exercise will inform its views on any legal, supervisory and policy measures that may be required &ndash; but any such interventions will need to be carefully considered. </p>  <p>  I would agree with the Central Bank&rsquo;s assessment of the complexity of this issue and that we will need to carefully consider any potential remedies, as to do so may improve matters for certain consumers while at the same time impact negatively on other consumers.  I do not think we are at the point of making conclusions on this issue and I will await the views of the Bank in this regard.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputies should note that the insurance business linked to An Post operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of An Post and is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Like other insurance companies, I cannot direct or interfere in the commercial decisions that it makes in relation to pricing or coverage.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-13a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111300059#WRA01900"><p>While neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, the Government, through the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) Reports, has identified the key problems that need to be addressed if we are to significantly reduce the cost of business insurance.</p><p>In this regard, the work of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) has been of critical importance. It found that the level of awards here for soft tissue injuries were 4.4 times higher than England and Wales.  Such a discrepancy is in my view unjustified and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  It recommended that the Judiciary should be made responsible for recalibrating award levels.</p><p>With the passage of the Judicial Council Act, I am confident that the Judiciary will prioritise this recalibration exercise and that they will take account of the PIC&rsquo;s findings.  I would also note that the Law Reform Commission is currently undertaking a detailed analysis as to whether we could establish constitutionally sound legislation to cap or limit the amount of damages a court may award.  It is due to report back next year.</p><p>In respect of measures to address false or exaggerated claims, the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019,</i>strengthens the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures, and amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>, make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.  There have also been various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry.  In addition, the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud is an important step forward.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced then the insurance cost and coverage issues that are being experienced by businesses should recede.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-13a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111300059#WRA02300"><p>The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) is designed to help reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals in their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish-based operations of their employer or an associated company, thereby facilitating the creation of jobs and the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland.</p><p>Earlier this year, I commissioned an independent review of the scheme which was carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. In their report, Indecon confirmed to me the strong policy rationale for the continued relevance of SARP to the Irish economy. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy is based on export-led growth; Foreign Direct Investment has been and continues to be an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development. The existence of an incentive like SARP is an acknowledgement that we are competing on a global basis for highly skilled and mobile executives. The competition for this talent is intense, particularly for the types of skills required to facilitate the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland.</p><p>The existence of similar (and indeed more attractive) special assignee type tax reliefs in a number of competitor jurisdictions creates a market failure that would not be addressed if not for the continued existence of SARP.</p><p>The benefits of SARP, aside from enhancing our international competitiveness, are detailed clearly in the Indecon report and they include:</p><p>- Increased employment and retention of staff within SARP companies;</p><p>- Associated additional investment in the economy of the order of &euro;25 million;</p><p>- Additional Corporation Tax receipts;</p><p>- Additional PAYE receipts; and</p><p>- R&amp;amp;D spillover activity.</p><p>The Indecon report also highlights the following data regarding companies that availed of SARP for the year 2017:</p><p>- they paid over &euro;2.5 billion in corporation tax;</p><p>- they employed over 155,00 individuals; and,</p><p>- they paid over &euro;1.9 billion in PAYE taxes.</p><p>On the basis of these findings, and in the interests of providing certainty for potential beneficiary firms, I am providing for the extension of SARP in Finance Bill 2019 until 31 December 2022 from the current sunset date of 31 December 2020. </p><p>More generally in relation to SARP, there is of course a balance to be struck between the principle of horizontal equity within the tax system and the need to compete internationally for highly skilled and mobile personnel. In this regard, and in order to seek to ensure that the appropriate balance is maintained, the issue is kept under regular review through detailed examinations of the type just recently carried out by Indecon. </p><p>The &lsquo;Key Employee Engagement Programme&rsquo; (KEEP) was introduced in Budget 2018 and has the objective of supporting SMEs in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises to recruit and retain key employees.  Smaller and/or younger companies with growth potential may not have the cash resources available to offer comparable salary packages to those offered by large, established businesses.  However, where the employee believes in the growth potential of the firm, and by extension the potential for the company shares to increase in value, remuneration in the form of share options may improve the attractiveness of the SME employment offer.</p><p>International research has shown that Employee Financial Participation can be effective in fostering partnership and increasing competitiveness and in helping companies to attract and retain staff in a competitive international labour market.

It is important to understand that these payments serve different purposes and some have been in place for some time:  The levies and contributions are as follows:</p>  <p>  The Motor Insurers Insolvency Compensation Fund (MIIC Fund) commenced on 1 December 2018 and was introduced by the Insurance Amendment Act 2018. This is a contribution equivalent to 2% of gross motor premiums and is being provided by motor insurers in order to finance the gap between what the ICF used pay to third party claimants (65%) and the amount which the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland pays in respect of victims of uninsured and untraceable drivers (100% of claim as general rule). This is not considered a levy as the decision rests with the insurance companies as to how they finance this contribution, i.e. either through absorbing it or passing it onto consumers.  </p>  <p>  The  contribution rate is subject to an annual review by the Minister and may be varied between 0 and 3% depending on factors such as the amount held in the MIIC Fund and the likelihood of a call on that Fund.  In a steady state, this contribution is likely to be required for a period of 8 to 9 years. </p>  <p>  The second contribution that impacts motor premium is the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) levy. This levy was in place from 1984 to 1992 and was reintroduced in January 2012. It currently applies at a rate of 2% of all gross premium income and its purpose is to repay the Exchequer for funding the administration of Quinn Insurance. As there is still a significant amount owing to the State, the levy is likely to be applied for another 10 years or so. The balance on the loan provided by the Minister to the ICF was &euro;800.6m at 31 December 2018.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that there is a stamp duty on non-life insurance premiums that was introduced in 1982. The rate of stamp duty when introduced was 1%, rising to 2% in 1993 and further increased to 3% in the 2009 Supplementary Budget. This stamp duty on non-life insurance premiums forms a part of general stamp duty receipts and is paid into the Central Fund along with other tax receipts.</p></reply>

It also imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  </p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 transposed the provisions of the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law and provide a framework within which all lenders that provide mortgage credit to consumers in the European Union must operate.  The Regulations set out further requirements to protect mortgage borrowers, including requirements in respect of provision of standardised information to consumers and the requirement to carry out creditworthiness assessments.  Furthermore, the Regulations provide that a lender is not to provide residential mortgage credit to a consumer unless the assessment indicates that the borrower is likely to be in a position to meet his/her obligations in the manner required by the credit agreement.  </p>  <p>  The Consumer Credit Act 1995 also includes requirements for housing loans, including buy-to-let mortgages. Under the Act, there are provisions in relation to insurance and duties on lenders to supply documentation and information on a mortgage loan.</p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears applies to all regulated mortgage lenders and credit servicing firms operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence. It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent way by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. </p>  <p>  Overall, therefore, there is a robust consumer protection regulatory framework governing the provision and operation of mortgage agreements.</p></reply>

The report advocated the use of market value of residential properties as the basis of assessment and this recommendation was accepted by the Government. The Design Group considered that under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property would be related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it was located and the features and amenities of the neighbourhood. There would be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the property. The charging structure for LPT is progressive. The basic rate of 0.18 percent applies up to property values of &euro;1 million with a higher rate of 0.25 percent applying on the portion of value above the &euro;1 million threshold. </p><p>The Inter-departmental LPT Review Group which reported to me earlier this year was conscious of the potential effects of significant changes in LPT liability on individual households and how progressive these might be. Considerable work was done by the Review Group on the estimated impact of changes in property values including a Distributional Impact Analysis. The Distributional Impact Analysis using the ESRI SWITCH Model (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) tax and benefit micro-simulation model, was used to compare the impact which the proposed reform scenarios would have on household incomes relative to an indicative benchmark position where the property value increases but there is no change in the LPT rate charged. The results indicate that all scenarios were progressive rather than regressive to varying degrees (see pages 74-77 of LPT review report ).  </p><p>I referred the Review Report to the Budgetary Oversight Committee which has issued its Scrutiny Report on  the matter. With this input, I will now reflect on how best to proceed and give effect to changes to the LPT based on the policy objectives I consider should underpin the tax. These are</p><p>- Protection of the overall yield</p><p>- Relative stability in household liabilities with modest and affordable increases should they arise</p><p>- Integration of new properties into the LPT base</p><p>- Maintenance of the tax base with a small number of exemptions, and</p><p>- Upholding the progressivity of the tax.</p></reply>

Since its establishment, staffing at the Commission has grown from two Commissioners and four administrative staff, to five Commissioners and twenty three administrative staff at various grades as of end-October 2019.  </p><p>I am advised by the TAC that there were 3,401 open appeals on 31 October, 2019. I am also advised that it is difficult for the TAC to provide a fully accurate quantum figure due to the nature of tax disputes; however at 31 October, 2019 the TAC recorded an estimated quantum of approximately &euro;3.7 billion. Of this amount, &euro;2.5 billion is comprised in 10 appeals, five of which were received by the TAC in the last week of December 2018.</p><p>Some appeals cannot be progressed when the Commission has to await the outcome of court proceedings. For example, a stay may have been placed on the progression of the appeals by the TAC by Order of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court. Of the 10 highest-value appeals before the TAC, two appeals with a combined value of &euro;1.67 billion are currently stayed by Court Order and cannot be progressed by the TAC until the stays are lifted.</p><p>Factors which have contributed to the development of a backlog of appeals include:</p><p>1. the Commission inheriting a substantial number of legacy appeals on establishment and,</p><p>2. the process for appeals changed on establishment, resulting in appeals now being notified to the Commission in the first instance, rather than to Revenue.</p><p>Due to the growing backlog and requests for extra resources, I commissioned an independent review of the workload and operations of the Commission in 2018.</p><p>The review was conducted by Niamh O&rsquo;Donoghue, a former Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, and examined the governance structures, workload and operations of the Commission. The resulting report was published on Budget Day last year and is available at the following link - www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2019/Documents/18.%20Independent%20review%20of%20the%20workload%20and%20operations%20of%20the%20Tax%20Appeals%20Commission.pdf.</p><p>I expressed my full support for the recommendations. Work on implementation is ongoing both in the Department and the TAC.  The following actions have taken place to date:</p><p>- A near doubling of the Commission&rsquo;s budget for 2019 to accommodate the recommendations of the review. This budget has been maintained for 2020.</p><p>- The authorisation of the appointment of three additional Temporary Appeal Commissioners, two of whom took up their appointments in September with a further Commissioner to commence in January.</p><p>- The recommended additional administrative and technical posts were sanctioned and recruitment for these posts is nearing completion.</p><p>- Enhanced regular contact between the Commission and the Department on governance matters and corporate supports is taking place, and</p><p>- An administration working group meets regularly to address any issues arising between the Commissioners and Revenue in relation to the administration of appeals.</p><p>The Finance (Tax Appeals and Prospectus Regulation) Bill 2019 is currently progressing in the D&aacute;il. This Bill will enable progression of another key recommendation of the review, the appointment of a Chairperson.</p><p>While a backlog of appeals remains, the additional budget and resources should allow the TAC to make progress in addressing the current backlog. I expect the overall number of appeals on hand, and consequently the quantum of tax under appeal, to begin to decrease steadily over time.</p></reply>

Over the course of 2019 a total of &euro;14.4bn of benchmark bond funding was raised. This funding was completed at a weighted average yield of 0.9% and a weighted average maturity of over 16 years. A further &euro;0.4bn was issued by way of a new inflation linked bond maturing in 2045 and a 100-year note maturing in 2119. This brings total long-term funding for the year to close to &euro;15bn.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency that it is confident its prudent approach to the Exchequer&rsquo;s funding requirement means it can meet the Exchequer&rsquo;s funding needs, irrespective of the risks &ndash; such as a no-deal Brexit &ndash; that might emerge.</p>  <p>  The pre-funding strategy of the NTMA in recent years means the Exchequer is in a strong position ahead of the upcoming debt maturities.

These bonds have outstanding balances currently of &euro;10.6bn and &euro;6.5bn respectively. In addition there are four &pound;0.4bn tranches of the UK Bilateral loan maturing in 2020. So in total there is approximately &euro;19bn of maturing medium/long-term debt next year.</p>  <p>  In terms of contingency planning for Brexit, the NTMA constantly monitors developments in the bond markets. Ireland&rsquo;s debt dynamics continue to improve and debt servicing costs are declining. The Exchequer&rsquo;s funding position is strong due to the activities of the NTMA in recent years, and refinancing needs for next year have been significantly reduced through active debt management. The NTMA has completed its bond funding programme for the year and expects the Exchequer to have approximately &euro;15bn in cash balances leaving it well positioned heading into 2020.</p></reply>

The case was granted priority status and the confidential written proceedings have taken place in private over the last number of years.

The study also concluded that a fully cashless society would not be an appropriate objective. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific recommendations set out in the report referred to by the Deputy, the quarterly Payments Monitor published by the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland shows that while the volume of ATM withdrawals has remained stable in recent years, the value of cash withdrawn from ATMs has recently been growing and is up 5.7 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2019.  </p>  <p>  The report finds that cashback in shops is currently only common practice in 11 EU Member States and recommends that it be promoted. Ireland, of course, is one of those 11 Member States, with cashback a long and well-established practice in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  There certainly has been a notable increase in the use of electronic payments, particularly in contactless payments, over the last decade.   In recent years there is also evidence of greater financial inclusion.  The CSO Household Budget Survey Data shows that the proportion of households with access to a current account in Ireland has increased significantly. The EU Payment Account Directive, transposed in 2016, makes it easier for consumers who do not have a payment account to open one, whatever their personal financial situation. </p>  <p>  My officials will continue to monitor developments in the area of payments.</p></reply>

The macroeconomic outlook is set out in the <i>Economic and Fiscal Outlook</i>published with Budget 2020. This included, at Box 4, an assessment of the macroeconomic outlook that would apply in the event of an agreed exit by the UK at end October. </p><p>The Withdrawal Agreement endorsed by the European Council, will now require ratification by the European Parliament and the UK Parliament. Pending ratification of the deal, it is not possible to say if the outlook will be different to that set out in Budget 2020.</p><p>If the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified, the UK will enter a transition period until at least the end of 2020. In this situation the outlook would be broadly similar to that set out in Table 4 (Box 4) in the <i>Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2020</i>. This shows that, in the event of an agreed exit, GDP growth is forecast to be 3.1 per cent in 2020, with employment growth projected at 1.7 per cent next year and the unemployment rate expected to be 5.1 per cent. </p><p>The revised Political Declaration envisages an ambitious trading relationship for goods on the basis of a Free Trade Agreement, but until there is greater clarity on the post-transition relationship there is likely to be continued uncertainty, particularly with respect to private sector investment. My Department has been in contact with the ESRI on the economic impact of the revised Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future relationship. I am satisfied that the existing analysis in the joint research by the Department of Finance and ESRI, published in March this year, broadly captures the range of possible future relationships. The analysis included a free trade agreement (of which there could be many forms), and a trading relationship under World Trade Organisation (WTO) frameworks. The impacts of these were modelled and estimated in the joint research which was published in March this year. </p><p>Under these scenarios, over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) the level of GDP would be of the order of between 1.9 and 3.3 per cent lower, respectively, compared to a situation where the UK remains in the EU. The negative impacts will be most severely felt in those sectors with strong export ties to the UK market &ndash; such as the agri-food, manufacturing and tourism sectors and also SMEs generally &ndash; along with their suppliers. The impact will be particularly noticeable outside the main cities.</p><p>My Department will continue to monitor developments with respect to the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the future relationship with the UK, and will update the macroeconomic and fiscal projections to take account of any developments in the Spring of next year at the latest.</p></reply>

The balance of regulatory costs has been funded by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1942 (as amended). The cost of regulating the credit union sector has increased over recent years with the emergence of the necessity to increase the intensity of supervision of this sector. Given that total assets of the sector have remained relatively static, this has resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of the total cost of funding provided by the sector as a whole.  In 2018, the credit union sector contributed &euro;1.7 million (circa 9 per cent of the total costs incurred in regulating the sector). </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I approved the Central Bank request to recover 50 per cent of credit union costs on a phased basis, starting with a 20 per cent recovery rate for the 2019 levy, which will be levied on an arrears basis in 2020, moving to 35 per cent in 2020 (levied in 2021) and to 50 per cent in 2021 (levied in 2022).  In response to the Central Bank's request I also recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50 per cent target until:</p>  <p>  a. The levy trajectory has reached the planned 50 per cent rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and</p>  <p>  b. A public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50 per cent is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector.</p>  <p>  In contrast to this, recovery rates in 2018 for all other industry categories ranged from 65 per cent to 100 per cent, and  the Central Bank intends to increase all to 100 per cent funding over the next number of years.  </p>  <p>  Exemptions from levies result in a burden on the tax payer through state subvention.  Given that all other financial services sectors are at, or moving towards, 100% recovery, the move towards 50 per cent in respect of credit unions, with further increases at that time being subject to consultation and Ministerial approval, is measured and takes account of the role that credit unions play in Irish society. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, held a public consultation on potential changes to the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund Levy. Following this review I announced on 1 October 2019 a reduction in the levy rate which will result in a reduction of &euro;4 million per annum from &euro;9 million in 2019 to &euro;5 million from 2020, or 44 per cent reduction.    </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance I have also reduced the Stabilisation Scheme Levy materially and since 2017 no further levies have been charged by the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo). I have also committed to a further review of the Stabilisation Scheme in 2020.</p></reply>

To first address the point about moving towards a cashless society, earlier this year I launched a study commissioned by my Department benchmarking Ireland&rsquo;s payment industry. That study found that cash remains a vital part of the Irish payment system and concluded that a fully cashless society would not be an appropriate objective.</p>  <p>  In relation to payment systems, I am informed by the Central Bank that Ireland&rsquo;s retail electronic payments are processed by pan-European based payment systems, primarily the Eurosystem&rsquo;s large value payment system TARGET2 and EBA Clearing&rsquo;s retail payments system STEP2.</p>  <p>  Both of these systems have high levels of reliability and resilience, resulting from the very high standards to which they are held. Both systems are subject to Eurosystem oversight, with the ECB having the leading oversight role. Both are assessed against the Systemically Important Payment Systems Regulation, which imposes strict requirements, including in relation to operational risk, business continuity, credit risk, liquidity risk, settlement finality, and participation default rules and procedures.</p>  <p>  From the perspective of the Central Bank&rsquo;s supervision of financial institutions that participate in the payments system in Ireland (i.e. banks, payment institutions, etc.), the risks associated with information technology and cyber-attacks are a key concern given the potentially serious implications for prudential soundness, consumer protection, financial stability and the reputation of the Irish financial system.   </p>  <p>  Strengthening the operational and cyber resilience of the financial system is a key priority for the Central Bank.  This includes enhancing the resilience of the firms within that system to operational disruptions due to information technology issues, particularly as these issues can negatively impact on consumers. </p>  <p>  The volumes of retail and wholesale payments settled daily are substantial, and issues occur from time to time. Where this happens, the vast majority are resolved within the business day. The Central Bank expects financial institutions to take all necessary steps to minimise the number of occurrences and, when they happen, to respond with appropriate urgency and to minimise the impact on consumers.  These expectations are communicated to all firms as part of ongoing supervisory engagement.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the pricing of insurance products is a commercial matter for insurers and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any function in this matter.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Consequently, the Government cannot direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as those in the leisure sector.  </p><p>Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately remedy this issue.  In addition, there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address it, in particular the fact that for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and as set out above it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply.</p><p>I wish to emphasise however that insurance issues remains a priority for the Government. The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), chaired by Minister of State Michael D'Arcy, TD is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of both of its reports. Its most recent Progress Update was published in July and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed.  To that end, some key achievements to date from the two reports, include the following:</p><p>- The enactment of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019</i>, in July which provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee to provide guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum;</p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019</i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;</p><p>- Amendments to the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; the Central Bank is currently reviewing the possibility of expanding is scope to cover business insurance; and</p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee</i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.</p><p>I  believe that these reforms are having an impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August show that the price of motor insurance is now 27.1% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.  However, undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for businesses and other operators in the leisure sector is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions, and the establishment of the Judicial Council is crucial in this regard.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced, then the insurance cost and coverage issues that are being experienced by the leisure sector should recede.</p></reply>

The exact impact will be dependent on the nature of the final agreement between the EU and the UK regarding its involvement with the EU Budget post-Brexit. </p>  <p>  Under the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and UK, the UK had agreed to continue to pay into the EU Budget for the remaining years of the current MFF, as if it was still a member. This would result in no additional impact on Ireland&rsquo;s contributions or receipts up to the end of the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) in December 2020.</p>  <p>  However, if that Withdrawal Agreement is not concluded and there is a no-deal Brexit, the impacts on the EU Budget will need to be clarified. Under this scenario the UK would need to outline its intentions regarding whether it still intended to continue making payments towards the current MFF. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has prepared a contingency proposal which establishes a legal basis for the UK to continue to both make payments into the EU budget and to access receipts from it for the year 2020 even in the case of a no-deal scenario. This framework seeks to minimise any unnecessary disruption for beneficiaries of EU spending programmes at the time of withdrawal. </p>  <p>  If the UK decided not to continue with EU budget payments, then both the Commission and Member States would need to consider the most appropriate way forward. However, the gap would likely need to be mitigated by either increased contributions from other Member States, reductions in EU funding programmes, or a combination of both. </p>  <p>  My Department monitors and analyses the potential impact of Brexit on our EU budget contributions on an ongoing basis. This analysis is based on the best information and data available at the time in question.</p></reply>

Borrowers may request their credit report at any time free of charge at centralcreditregister.ie. </p><p>A sample CCR credit report and explanation is available in the Central Bank&rsquo;s factsheet at .  This indicates that a credit report has four parts:-</p><p>Part one shows the personal information submitted to the CCR in respect of a credit information subject.</p><p>Part two shows a summary of the active and closed credit agreements entered into by the borrower, and also information on credit applications made by the borrower.  In respect of credit applications, the information in this part will include the type of loan product sought and the amount involved.  (However, it should be noted that information on credit reports simply records the fact that a credit application has been made and that it does not record whether or not a credit application was approved by a lender or not taken up by the borrower; furthermore, in respect of credit applications, the name of the lending institution to which a credit application was made will be displayed only on the credit report requested by the borrower).  Pursuant to section 8 of the Act, information on credit applications is retained for a period of six months (and is available for inclusion in part two only if a credit report is requested during that period).</p><p>Part three provides detailed information on outstanding credit agreements.</p><p>Part four, which is called the &lsquo;footprint&rsquo;, is a record of all the dates that a credit report has been seen, by whom and the purpose of the enquiry, and such data is kept pursuant to section 17 of the Act. (On the credit report that is produced for lenders, this &lsquo;footprint&rsquo; is visible only for two years but the name of the lender is not published.  On the credit report that is produced for borrowers, the footprint is visible for five years, and the name of the lender is published).</p><p>In respect of the specific incidence raised by the Deputy, the Central Bank has advised that the lender in question had a valid reason for accessing each applicant&rsquo;s credit report once.  However, searches were duplicated in error due to a technical issue experienced by the lender. This error has since been corrected and the &ldquo;credit application summary&rdquo; in part 2 of the relevant credit reports now correctly contains one credit application.  </p><p>However, as a separate issue and as indicated above, each time a borrower&rsquo;s credit report is accessed, a digital footprint is created on the credit report.  In this case, in the interests of transparency, the digital footprint remains as it properly reflects that more than one enquiry was made.  The Central Bank advises that there is no information to suggest that any individual borrower has been disadvantaged as a result of this incident.  A borrower who believes that they may have been disadvantaged should contact the lender in question to discuss the matter. As already stated, borrowers can also request their credit report free of charge at www.centralcreditregister.ie.  Borrowers have a right to request an amendment to any information that they believe is incomplete, inaccurate or not up to date.  </p><p>It is important to note that the CCR does not determine if a credit application is approved or not. That decision is solely made by the lender, and aside from the content of the credit report, the decision will also include consideration of other matters such as borrower&rsquo;s income and assets etc.</p><p>More generally, under the Act, lenders are required to ensure that personal data is accurate, complete and up to date.  The Central Bank expects that lenders have robust systems and controls in place to ensure the integrity of the data that they submit to the CCR. In the event of an error in reporting, the Central Bank expects the lender to take immediate steps to correct the data and separately to identify the root cause and ensure that the appropriate solution is applied to avoid any recurrence of the error. </p><p>The Central Bank also expects lenders to be aware of their own obligations under data protection law, in particular whether a data breach should be reported to the Data Protection Commission.  Lenders may under data protection provisions also be required to write to customers explaining what has happened and what action they have taken to correct the errors. This may also require a report being made to the Data Protection Commission by the lender.

It was submitted to me for consideration in September 2017, in advance of its publication on Budget Day, 10 October 2017. The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department. The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.</p>  <p>  One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.  In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.  Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place. </p>  <p>  A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. Earlier this year, the report of the interdepartmental review of LPT noted that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options, deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.  Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises.  The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.</p>  <p>  The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.  A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. The Housing Analytics Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is currently active and a number of Departments and agencies are involved in its work, including the Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Revenue and the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.  Consideration of these options will continue within the relevant time frames.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.</p></reply>

This was reaffirmed in the Section 53 Annual Statement 2020 which was recently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The realisation of this surplus depends on the success of NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing deleveraging and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.</p>  <p>  Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's subordinated debt and equity obligations have been repaid in full, which is expected to be by summer of 2020. It is estimated that &euro;2 billion will be transferred in H2 2020 with a further &euro;2 billion being transferred during 2021. This timeline is contingent on NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus of &euro;4 billion remaining unchanged and is subject to prevailing market conditions in realising the remaining assets.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.</p></reply>

Production companies are now required to apply to the DCHG before commencement of Irish production to have the film certified as a qualifying film. </p>  <p>  As part of the application process, applicants must provide a skills development plan and, if the amount of eligible expenditure is over &euro;2m, that plan must be agreed with Screen Ireland. Additionally, a post project skills development report is required for each project.</p>  <p>  In terms of quality employment, the monitoring of compliance with employment rights legislation is primarily a matter for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through the Workplace Relations Commission.  However, as part of the new certification process to be undertaken by DCHG, an applicant company is required to sign an undertaking of compliance with all relevant employment legislation. This undertaking is required to be signed and furnished with every section 481 application.</p>  <p>  These conditions shall be met not just by a producer company but also by the qualifying company or, as the Deputy has phrased it, the Designated Activity Company. If a producer does not comply with the employment and skills development requirements set out by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, any amount already claimed may be recoverable, with interest. </p>  <p>  I have further been advised by my officials that, following a joint request by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), the Services, Industry, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU), and Screen Producers Ireland, the WRC has agreed to undertake an audit of the Republic of Ireland Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector with a view to examining industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedure, assessing issues arising (if any), and making recommendations for their improvement where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The timeframe for receiving submissions on this matter has now closed. My officials will be analysing the results of this process once a report is published.</p></reply>

This took effect from 1 January 2011. Cumulative inflation in the period from 2011 to 2018 has been of the order of 3.5 per cent. </p>  <p>  General increases to tax credits result in an increase in a level of income that is effectively exempt from income tax.  It is estimated that in 2020, some 28 per cent of taxpayer units will be exempt from income tax and USC.  An increase in the Personal and Employee Tax Credits would be likely to increase the proportion of earners who are exempt from income tax and would also narrow the income tax base.  In addition, it would give rise to calls to increase the value of the Earned Income Tax Credit which applies to self-employed persons.</p>  <p>  During the financial crisis our income tax base narrowed to the point where 45 per cent of taxpayers were exempt from income tax.  This was unsustainable and placed a disproportionate burden on those who were within the tax net to provide the tax revenues needed for public services and social supports.</p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s position that earners start to pay the marginal rate of tax at too low an income level and it is committed to reducing excessive tax rates for low and middle income earners while also keeping the tax base broad. </p>  <p>  As a result of changes in recent Budgets, USC rates have been reduced to 0.5%, 2% and 4.5%.  The income level at which taxpayers begin to pay the higher rate of tax has also been increased by &euro;2,500 and there have been increases in both the Home Carer Tax Credit and the Earned Income Credit.  The impact of these changes is that the top marginal rate on incomes up to &euro;70,000 has been reduced from 52% to 48.5%.</p></reply>

Modified domestic demand, which adjusts for distortions in the Irish economy, was up 2.3 per cent over the first half of the year, a solid performance, though a moderation on 2018. The best barometer of our current economic performance is the labour market, where strong growth in employment over the last number of years has continued into this year. Total employment increased by 63,100 (+2.8 per cent) in the first half of 2019, while the unemployment rate for October, fell below 5 per cent for the first time since 2007. </p>  <p>  As a small open economy Ireland is particularly exposed to external risks which are firmly tilted to the downside at present.  First and foremost is the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU. Secondly, any further disruption to trade or a more pronounced slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  Regarding Brexit, the Budget 2020 central scenario projections assumed that the UK would leave the EU without ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, i.e. a disorderly exit. Under this scenario, GDP growth of just 0.7 per cent would be in prospect next year, reflecting both the impact of Brexit and the continued weakness in the global outlook. However, given recent events in the UK and the &lsquo;flextension&rsquo; granted by the EU, a disorderly Brexit in 2020 is less likely - although still possible &mdash; than it was only a few weeks ago. Nevertheless, any form of Brexit will have a negative impact on the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies.</p></reply>

Article 284 of the Directive permits Ireland to maintain two thresholds - &euro;75,000 for goods and &euro;37,500 for services - and only permits an increase in these thresholds to maintain their value in real terms, that is they may only be increased in line with inflation and for no other reason. Ireland could have one threshold, but that threshold would have to be the lower one of &euro;37,500. </p>  <p>  The distinction between the supply of goods and the supply of services is a feature of the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT legislation.  The value added in relation to a supply of a good is the difference between the purchase price and the sale price, while the value added in the supply of a service will generally be a much higher percentage of the price charged and involve a significant direct input by the business proprietor or his or her employees.</p></reply>

The new rules require insurers to provide policyholders with details of the prior year&rsquo;s premium paid, as well as quotations for each policy option available to them (such as comprehensive, third party fire and theft and third party only). In addition, the renewal notification period has been extended from 15 to 20 working days for motor, health, property and general liability insurance to allow policyholders more time to seek comparison quotes The background to these new rules is a recommendation from the Cost of Insurance Working Group Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the changes have been made through amendments to the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No.74). I believe that each of these measures should assist consumers in making decisions at renewal time, including encouraging them to shop around and, if favourable to them, switch insurance provider.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government is actively supporting a Private Members Bill - Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill, which is scheduled at Report Stage in the Dail this week and should progress through the Oireachtas by the end of the year. The purpose of the Bill is to reform and modernise the law of consumer insurance contracts and to level the playing field between consumers and insurers. This Bill has various provisions aimed at increasing transparency in premiums charged and the management of claims.  A notable change, which is based on a recommendation of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, will be the requirements for insurers to inform policy holders, including small businesses, in circumstances where a claim has been made against them by a third party. Such communications have not always occurred and the implementation of this provision will therefore be a significant step forward in improving transparency around the claims process.</p>  <p>   Furthermore, with the publication shortly of the first report of the National Claims Information Database on private motor insurance, there should be much greater transparency around the settlement of claims process and how this occurs.  It is hoped that this information together with a recalibrated level of awards to be developed by the Judiciary as a result of the enactment of the Judicial Council Act 2019 should lead to a greater consistency of award levels, thus enhancing the role of Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) and reducing litigation levels.</p></reply>

The 2019 review is currently underway and the results will be announced in early December. The annual review considers whether the measures continue to meet the objectives of strengthening bank and borrower resilience and reducing the likelihood and impact of a credit-house price spiral emerging.</p>  <p>  The system of allowances give the banks discretion to lend above the LTV and LTI limits. These are separated based on whether a borrower is a first-time buyer (FTB) or not. For FTBs, 20% of new lending to FTBs can take place above the 3.5 times LTI limit. As the 90% LTV limit is already set higher for FTBs, only 5% of new lending to FTBs can exceed this limit. These allowances are targeted to FTBs in that they can only be used for FTB lending. Separate allowances exist for second-time buyer (SSB) new lending. </p>  <p>  Within the FTB allowances, there are no rules in place around which types of FTB borrowers would receive the allowances. This is a matter for individual lenders, based on an evaluation of each specific borrower and the lender&rsquo;s own credit policies. An important feature of the measures is that the limits are in addition to individual banks' credit policies and are not a substitute for lenders&rsquo; responsibilities to assess affordability and lend prudently. </p>  <p>  Therefore, subject to the requirement to comply with the provisions of the macro-prudential mortgage lending rules, the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code and other regulatory requirements, it remains the responsibility of an individual lender to assess the credit worthiness of an individual and to decide whether or not to provide a loan in any particular case, or how much credit to provide in any particular case. </p>  <p>  The data on new lending under the mortgage measures and the usage of the allowances is published on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website every six months. This shows that for the first six months of 2019, 16% of new lending to FTBs was at an LTI above 3.5 times.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day workings of the office or in the decisions which he takes.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 which commenced on 1 January 2018 established the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. </p>  <p>  One of the main roles of the Ombudsman is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate complaints about the conduct of financial or pension service providers. The FSPO was established to provide an alternative to the Courts for consumers who have unresolved disputes with a financial or pension service provider and all investigations by the Ombudsman are free of charge to the consumer.  Subject only to an appeal to the High Court, a finding of the Ombudsman in respect of a complaint is legally binding on all parties </p>  <p>  The FSPO has advised me that the office has an important role in redressing the balance of power between the individual consumer and provider. The FSPO does this by making its service as informal and accessible as possible. It mediates between the parties and where necessary it investigates and issues legally binding decisions. The Ombudsman has the power to direct a financial service provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;500,000 to a complainant. He can also direct that a financial service provider rectify the conduct that is the subject of the complaint. There is no limit to the value of rectification he can direct. </p>  <p>  The FSPO&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2018-2021 aims to ensure it operates in a way that contributes to promoting the best interests of consumers and actual or potential beneficiaries of financial or pension services in the efficient and effective handling of complaints.  The FSPO inherited 3,178 complaints from its predecessor bodies and received 5,692 complaints in 2018. It closed 4,443 complaints in 2018 leaving a balance of 4,427 complaints on hand at the end of 2018. Such high volumes of complaints cause the FSPO to be unable to process complaints as quickly as it would wish to. </p>  <p>  The FSPO&rsquo;s Strategic Plan recognised the increasing number of complaints and anticipates a further increase in the coming years. The overall objective of this Plan is to ensure that the organisation can deal efficiently with this increase and to enhance the experience of its customers by delivering its services faster and better. In order to deliver the objectives in its Strategic Plan the FSPO submitted a Workforce Plan to my Department and I approved the recruitment of an additional 35 staff earlier this year. </p>  <p>  The FSPO has been proactively recruiting to fill these posts. However, similar to many public sector bodies, the current buoyant job market is making it difficult for the office to retain staff.  This is mainly because the FSPO&rsquo;s highly trained staff are much sought after in both the public and private sector. The FSPO inherited 53 staff from its predecessor bodies in January 2018. However, despite recruiting and appointing additional 42 staff since then, it currently has 59 staff.</p>  <p>  The Ombudsman has further informed me that additional staff will be joining it before the end of the year and that he will continue to recruit and train quality people to assist it to deliver on its mandate. The FSPO will continue to provide the most effective and efficient service possible in spite of the staff losses within the office.</p></reply>

As Capital Acquisitions Tax is generally payable by the beneficiary, rather than the disponer, the system promotes horizontal equity in that all individuals with similar circumstances are treated in a similar manner.</p>  <p>  It is a long-held principle of inheritance tax that transfers of assets between spouses are exempt. The spousal exemption from inheritance tax was extended to civil partners from 1 January 2011.</p>  <p>  As regards the gifting of a shared home, the treatment of gifting was amended substantially in the 2016 Finance Act. In general, it is now only possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house where it is gifted to a dependent relative.  A dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. This change was made to restore the original policy aim of the relief. </p>  <p>  Gifts are generally taxable in the same way as inheritances. There is an annual &euro;3,000 CAT relief available to all recipients of gifts.</p>  <p>  As regards the treatment of individuals with no children, gifts or inheritances from them are subject to either category B or C thresholds irrespective of their individual status. There would be a significant potential Exchequer cost with any extension of the Category A threshold to allow individuals with no children to nominate a potential beneficiary of their estate.  </p>  <p>  There are some CAT reliefs which are available for co-habiting couples. Cohabiting individuals can avail of the &lsquo;dwelling house exemption&rsquo; to bequeath their principal private residence, generally the most substantial asset owned by an individual, free from inheritance tax which allows for property to be inherited tax-free irrespective of its value where the beneficiary is already living in the house subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  Section 88A of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 exempts transfers of property made between qualified cohabitants within the meaning of Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants (CPCROC) Act 2010. This is a redress scheme which provides protection in law for long-term cohabiting couples and provides safeguards for an economically dependent cohabitant where a relationship has ended, or on death.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the exemption from gift tax and inheritance tax in these cases did not give cohabiting couples the same tax treatment as married couples or civil partners but simply legislated for the tax consequences of the redress arrangements for cohabitants under the CPCROC Act 2010.  </p>  <p>  I would say that any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples, including with respect to CAT, can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. There would also be potentially significant Exchequer costs in changing the current CAT rules to accommodate the changes sought by the Deputy.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, decisions by me in relation to the Tax Acts are made in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process. However, bearing in mind the issues outlined below, I am not minded, at this time, to support a proposal along the lines of that put forward in the Deputy's question.</p><p>Generally, rental income, after deduction of allowable letting expenses, is subject to tax as part of the total taxable income of a landlord. Individual landlords are subject to income tax on all their income combined, at the applicable rates, including USC and PRSI where appropriate.</p><p>Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&lsquo;<i>relief for certain income from leasing of farm land</i>&rsquo;) provides for the exemption of certain income from the leasing of farm land, where the land is let under a qualifying lease. This particular relief was designed to encourage longer term leases of farm land, with the targeted policy objective of assisting with the mobility and productive use of agricultural land. </p><p>When considering the introduction of any tax expenditure measure, my officials undertake an evaluation of the proposal in accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines. An evaluation will seek to address issues such as identification of the market failure, the policy rationale for intervention, cost, and whether a tax based measure is the most efficient form of intervention. With regard to the latter point, in many cases a market failure may be more appropriately remedied by a direct expenditure measure or through regulation. Other considerations include the potential for deadweight costs, the potential cost of the tax revenue foregone to the Exchequer and the scope for abuse. </p><p>Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention. I must be mindful of the many demands on the Exchequer and the need to maintain a broad base of taxation.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, in Finance Act 2018, and with effect from 1 January 2019, I provided for the full restoration of the amount of interest that may be deducted by landlords in respect of loans used to purchase, improve or repair their residential property, as a means to support the rental sector.</p></reply>

This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet. A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service. The fourth ship in the programme, L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, was commissioned into service in May 2019 reflecting an investment by the Government of over &euro;250 million in the new ships programme since 2010. The four ships are performing well in operational service. </p>  <p>  Naval Service ships are required to complete drydock maintenance, survey and inspection, twice during each ship five (5) year cycle. An intermediate drydock is carried out between two and a half (2.5) and three (3) years. A full drydock is carried out at five (5) years. Naval Service Ships which are beyond their originally projected thirty (30) year asset life, are drydocked for inspection every year, in order to manage ageing hull risk. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the capital maintenance programme (for drydocks) detailed above, Naval Service ships are required to undertake planned routine and non-routine maintenance on plant and machinery every day, 365 days a year, regardless of whether the ship is on patrol, undertaking Maritime Defence and Security Operations (MDSO) or alongside the Naval Base off Sailing Order. L&Eacute; Ciara is one of three ships in the current flotilla that are over 30 years old (L&Eacute; Eithne and L&Eacute; Ciara were built in 1984 and L&Eacute; Orla was built in 1985).  Accordingly, L&Eacute; Ciara is currently undergoing a planned annual dry-docking. </p>  <p>  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) which will be enabled for helicopter operations and will also have a freight carrying capacity. It is the intention to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV subject to the availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope. The cost of the MRV will only be known once the tender competition is concluded. </p>  <p>  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements.</p></reply>

This research paper can be accessed at:  . </p><p>In June 2019, the ESRI published a special article, Carbon taxation in Ireland: Distributional effects of revenue recycling policies. This special article examined the distributional effects of increases in the carbon tax for urban and rural households as well as the distributional effects of different revenue recycling mechanisms.  </p><p>This article can be accessed at: .</p><p>I recognise that the research points to carbon tax increases disproportionately impacting low income and rural households.  In order to minimise the impact of the increase on heating costs, I have delayed the increase on home heating fuels until 1st May 2020.  I am also increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week. This increase applies from the first of January 2020 and means an annual increase of &euro;56 to each household. Based on the findings from the aforementioned ESRI research, this will leave the 370,000 households who are in receipt of the fuel allowance better off than before the increase in the carbon tax. This ensures that the most vulnerable in society are protected from the increased carbon tax.</p><p>Alongside this I am providing increases to programmes that help to address the causes of fuel poverty. The Warmer Homes scheme provides free energy efficiency upgrades to households deemed to be in or at risk of energy poverty. This reduces the energy required to heat a home adequately, thus reducing a household&rsquo;s exposure to increases in energy costs.  This will be more effective in the long run at reducing heating costs than increases in the fuel allowance. An extra &euro;13m will be provided for this scheme in 2020, bringing its total budget allocation for the year to over &euro;50m.</p><p>These measures will help to protect the most vulnerable in society from the impact of the carbon tax increases in the short, medium and long term.</p></reply>

I also attend meetings of the Eurogroup, where the Ministers of the Euro Area Member States discuss matters concerning their shared responsibilities related to the euro.</p>  <p>  At both the ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings, Ministers work alongside the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to take stock of the latest economic situation, including the risks to the European economy&rsquo;s growth prospects. </p>  <p>  I regularly monitor the latest economic developments. My Department continually analyses and prepares briefing on short and medium-term macroeconomic trends in European and international economy. This includes informing me of the latest forecasts of the global economy and of our key trading partners from the international institutions.</p>  <p>  The Commission published its Autumn Economic Forecast on Thursday 7th  November. The forecast indicated that the European and the Euro Area economies have weakened over the past year, reflecting a considerable slowdown in external demand and contraction in the manufacturing sector.  While the Euro Area is now in its seventh consecutive year of growth, with growth expected to continue in all Member States, this is at a considerably slower rate than earlier in the decade. European labour markets have remained strong and the unemployment rate has fallen to below its pre-crisis level, fuelling robust wage growth, allowing domestic demand to expand at a relatively steady pace. The labour market is expected to maintain this performance albeit at a slower pace reflecting the broader economy.</p>  <p>  The European economy is expected to enter a protracted period of subdued growth and low inflation. The Commission is forecasting Euro Area GDP to expand by 1.1 per cent in 2019 and by 1.2 per cent in 2020 and 2021. The GDP forecast for the EU28 is for growth of 1.4 per cent in 2019 and 2020. This represents a significant slowdown from the growth rates seen in 2015-2017. The performance of individual Member States is diverging with some areas (e.g. Central and Eastern Europe, Malta, and Ireland) expanding faster than others (e.g. Italy, Germany).</p>  <p>  The Commission also identified a number of risks to future growth in its forecast, including; a less supportive external environment, persisting tension in the international trade environment, a slowdown in Euro Area manufacturing, and uncertainty related to Brexit.</p>  <p>  Member states promote stability and growth in their respective economies during the European Semester Cycle. The purpose of the cycle, commencing in November, is to provide a framework for coordination of economic policies and guidelines, delivered in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. In Spring/Summer the Commission makes country specific recommendations based on EU member state plans for macroeconomic, budgetary, and structural reforms. The recommendations are designed to put in place, and maintain, the necessary conditions for stability, growth, and jobs in all EU partners.</p>  <p>  The Commission Forecasts note that monetary policy conditions are expected to remain supportive and that the Euro Area fiscal stance is set to remain broadly neutral.</p>  <p>  In trade terms, almost half of all the trade in goods undertaken by Euro Area countries is with other Euro Area countries, and thus is not subject to currency risk. The nominal values of other key trading partner currencies (as the Euro) are determined by market forces.  The Commission forecasts are based on a standard technical assumption of unchanged interest and exchange rates from a given cut-off date. However, the variability of the international environment, including exchange rate developments, underlines the importance of continued competitiveness improvements including by focussing on costs we can control and by boosting our productivity. Ensuring a sustainable path for the public finances is also of fundamental importance. </p>  <p>  The adoption of tailored country-specific structural and fiscal reforms will help to boost future growth, increase resilience, and improve future living standards within the Euro Area.</p></reply>

Although in the Irish context, GDP can be distorted by globalisation factors, other indicators such as modified domestic demand confirm continued growth in our economy. The strength of the economy is most clearly evident in the labour market. Total employment increased by 63,100 (+2.8 per cent) in the first half of 2019 while the unemployment rate for October fell below 5 per cent for the first time since 2007. </p>  <p>  The strength of our economy reflects the important steps we have taken to improve our competitiveness. The 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook recently ranked Ireland as the 2nd most competitive country in the EU and the 7th most competitive country in the world.  In addition, since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 22 per cent.  </p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. In the first ten months of 2019, average annual inflation was just 0.9 per cent. On wage developments, average weekly earnings increased by 3.5 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2019. The rise in household incomes is a welcome development, however it needs to be monitored closely, as a significant acceleration in wages could undermine Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness relative to other European countries. </p>  <p>  Despite recent positive developments, the risks over the coming years are numerous and primarily external in nature. As well as continued uncertainty with respect to Brexit, there is also evidence of a continued slowdown in global growth, as has been recently reported by the IMF and the European Commission. </p>  <p>  The Budget 2020 central scenario projections assumed a disorderly Brexit scenario. Under this scenario, GDP growth of just 0.7 per cent would be in prospect next year, reflecting both the impact of a no-deal Brexit and weakness in the global outlook. However, given recent events in the UK and the &lsquo;flextension&rsquo; granted by the EU, a disorderly Brexit in 2020 is less likely, though still possible. Of course, any form of Brexit will have a negative impact on the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies.</p></reply>

Growth in modified domestic demand &ndash; a better barometer of economic conditions in Ireland &ndash; is estimated at 3.2 per cent this year and 1.4 per cent next year.</p>  <p>  Indeed as a barometer of how well our economy is performing, there is no story more positive than the one emanating from our labour market. The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has continued into this year, with total employment increasing by 45,000 (+2.0 per cent) in the year to Q2 2019. As a result, there are now 2.3 million people at work in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In an EU context, Ireland remains one of the fastest growing Member States. The strong growth and performance seen in our economy is also clearly illustrated by a comparison with the performance of our main trading partners &ndash; the Euro Area, the UK and the US. </p>  <p>  For the Euro Area the European Commission is forecasting growth of 1.1 per cent this year, and 1.2 per cent next year. The GDP forecast for the EU28 is for growth of 1.4 per cent in 2019 and 2020. This represents a significant slowdown from the growth rates seen in 2015-2017. </p>  <p>  The European economy is expected to enter a protracted period of subdued growth and low inflation. GDP should continue to grow in all Member States, albeit at a more moderate pace, in 2020 and 2021. The performance of individual Member States is diverging with some areas (e.g. Central and Eastern Europe, Malta, and Ireland) expanding faster than others (e.g. Italy, Germany).</p>  <p>  For the UK, modest GDP growth of 1.3 per cent is expected this year and 1.4 per cent next year, based on a technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK. </p>  <p>  Growth in the US economy is forecast to slow as tailwinds from the fiscal stimulus implemented last year fade. Growth is expected to fall from 2.3 per cent in 2019 to 1.8 per cent in 2020. </p>  <p>  In common with Ireland, there has been a recovery in employment growth in all our main export markets &ndash; though at a more modest pace &ndash; with a corresponding reduction in unemployment.</p></reply>

At all times the Government has sought to protect our citizens and support the economy, enterprise and jobs. Dedicated measures were announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019 including up to &euro;600 million that has been made available through the Future Growth Loan Scheme and Brexit Loan Scheme. This is already helping our businesses to mitigate the risks of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 builds on these preparations.  Budget 2020, including the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook which underpins it, was based on the sensible assumption that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October without an agreement. Budget 2020 involves a &lsquo;twin-track&rsquo; approach, namely:</p>  <p>  - Funding services and making progress on particular policy areas, and;</p>  <p>  - Supporting sectors and regions most exposed to Brexit-related disruption.</p>  <p>  In the event of a disorderly exit from the EU by the United Kingdom, certain sectors of our economy would be impacted more severely than others. In particular, indigenous enterprise and agriculture are likely to be the hardest hit, given our close trading relationship with the UK and the expected increase in tariffs. </p>  <p>  To mitigate against this, in addition to allowing the public finances to absorb the shock, the Budget set out a number of temporary, targeted support measures of over &euro;1.2 billion that could be triggered to ensure that that our economy will be protected in as far as is possible from the risks of a no deal Brexit. This is on top of existing grants and loans which are already available for business and agriculture, and is in addition to ongoing Government expenditure on Brexit preparedness.</p>  <p>  Assuming a no-deal Brexit ensures that the Government will have the necessary resources at its disposal to address this challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances and safeguarding the hard won progress of recent years in stabilising the public finances. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus is to protect our economic and financial interests, and to minimise the disruption to the Irish economy to the greatest extent possible. The best way we can mitigate against the risks posed by Brexit is through sensible budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities and to prepare for the challenges of Brexit.</p></reply>

Firstly, there is a possibility that the slowdown in global growth will become more prolonged, despite the initial expectation of the slowdown being temporary. Secondly, continued and increasing geopolitical uncertainty has the potential to disrupt growth in key regions and generate headwinds for output and employment in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Thirdly, an increase in protectionism, including increased tariffs on EU-US trade, could have a detrimental impact on living standards. Given Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small open economy with a high degree of integration in global value chains, any further disruption to trade or a slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  The fourth external risk identified is the potential for the outcome of Brexit to be more severe than initially estimated, notwithstanding the assumption of a no-deal Brexit in the baseline forecasts. On the other hand, there is the increasing possibility of the UK leaving the EU with a withdrawal agreement which represents an upside risk. </p>  <p>  A useful tool used by my Department to monitor global developments is the economic policy uncertainty index. The global index and the Ireland-specific index are currently at all-time highs, reflecting the challenges currently faced by the global and Irish economies.</p>  <p>  As these external challenges are largely beyond our control, the best way we can mitigate against them is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. That is what this Government has done and will continue to do.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each credit institution to set its own lending and deposit rates having regard to cost and competitive considerations and also to make its own lending decisions. Neither I nor the Central Bank have a role in prescribing the interest rates that commercial lenders may charge on their loans, including mortgages, or for deposits.</p><p>Part of the reason for the differential between Irish mortgage rates and those in other countries is the relatively large historical loss experience in the Irish market during the financial crisis and the related legacy issues of non-performing loans, many of which remain on banks' book. Banks are required to make adequate provisions for such loans.</p><p>Banks are also required to hold an adequate level of capital against mortgage lending. These capital requirements are calculated with reference to historical loss and default rates with the result that Irish banks are required to hold relatively more capital for new mortgage lending than many of their European peers, in some cases substantially more capital.  </p><p>In addition to their capital requirements, banks are also required to build up additional capital to meet regulatory capital buffers such as the countercyclical capital buffer which is intended to ensure banks can withstand future adverse economic shocks.</p><p>The impact of these capital requirements is reflected in the interest rates charged for mortgages in Ireland.  </p><p>Furthermore, the Irish banking system continues to hold a large amount of lower yielding tracker mortgages on their balance sheets and there is currently a high level of concentration in the market for new mortgage credit.  </p><p>The Central Bank has introduced a number of changes to the Consumer Protection Code that are designed to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments; for example, provision 6.5 (g) of the Code now requires lenders at least annually to, inter alia, notify their variable interest (other than tracker) mortgage customers whether they can move to a cheaper interest rate as a result of a change in their loan to value interest rate band and, if the customer is permitted to move, to invite the borrower to contact the lender to discuss the matter.  If the consumer is not permitted to move to a lower loan to value band with a lower interest rate, the consumer is nevertheless to be notified that he/she may be able to avail of a lower loan to value interest rate band from another lender based on an up to-date valuation of the property.  It should also be noted that the Central Bank macro prudential loan to value and loan to income residential mortgage lending restrictions do not apply to switcher mortgages. More generally, the Code also requires lenders at least annually to provide to variable rate (excluding tracker) mortgage holders:-</p><p>- a summary of other mortgage products offered by that lender which could provide savings for the consumer at that point in time,</p><p>- a statement that consumers should keep their mortgage arrangements under review as there may be other options that could provide savings for the borrower and</p><p>- a link to the relevant section of the Competition and Consumer Protection website relating to mortgage switching or changing mortgage type. </p><p>().</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-13a.192.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111300061#WRC05800"><p>Deputy, in advance of my reply, I am assuming that your use of the words &ldquo;investment funds&rdquo; is a reference to those firms in the non-bank sector i.e. retail credit and credit servicing firms.</p>  <p>  It is within the remit of the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s (the Central Bank) responsibilities to safeguard stability and protect consumers, and its approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that regulated entities have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.  </p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a statutory code that must be complied with by relevant regulated entities as a matter of law. The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.</p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:</p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;</p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution</p>  <p>  The arrears handling provisions in Chapter 8 of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code) apply when the loan is not a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies.  Amongst other protections, the Code requires that where an account is in arrears, a regulated entity must seek to agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears. </p>  <p>  Most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm. When a loan is sold, the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections continue to apply. Under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Code and the CCMA.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank carries out its supervision of regulated entities, including banks, retail credit and credit servicing firms in a number of ways, which includes both desk based and on-site reviews of various activities. In early 2018, I requested the Central Bank to review the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders. In November 2018, the Central Bank published a report on this matter. </p>  <p>  The review concluded that the CCMA is effective and working as intended in the context of the sale of loans, for borrowers who engage with the process. There was no evidence that retail credit and credit servicing firms do not engage with borrowers in arrears. When a loan is sold by a bank, any existing Alternative Repayment Arrangements (ARAs) in place with a borrower under the CCMA continue to be honoured until the agreed term of the ARA ends. There was no evidence that borrowers, whose circumstances have not changed, were being moved off existing ARAs by retail credit and credit servicing firms during the term of the ARA. There was no material difference in the level of repossessions by retail credit and credit servicing firms compared to banks.</p>  <p>  As a follow-up action to the Report on the CCMA, the Central Bank wrote to banks, retail credit and credit servicing firms in August 2019 to set out its expectations of all firms in respect of loan sales. These expectations include that:</p>  <p>  - Sufficient due diligence and information sharing takes place at the outset to ensure that complete customer files transfer as part of a loan sale.</p>  <p>  - Where a cooperating borrower is complying with the terms of an ARA and their loan is sold, the new regulated entity cannot unilaterally change the ARA.</p>  <p>  - The new regulated entity should continue to honour an ARA until review, expiry or by agreement, as appropriate. This includes honouring timelines and terms and conditions for reviews of the ARA.</p>  <p>  - Where the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed, any change to the ARA must be appropriate, sustainable and proportionate to that borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.</p></reply>

For example, on a Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) basis, annual inflation has been below 1 per cent since 2013. This trend is unlikely to change this year with HICP inflation of 0.9 per cent on average for the first ten months of 2019. This phenomenon is not restricted to Ireland. In recent years, low inflation has been a feature across all advanced economies. </p>  <p>  Irish inflation has been consistently below euro area inflation since 2008. The divergence between inflation in the euro area and Ireland can in part be attributed to the impact of euro-sterling appreciation on consumer prices in Ireland. In turn this reflects the importance of the UK as a source of imports of consumer products. </p>  <p>  While overall inflation has been subdued, services inflation has been robust, averaging 2.4 per cent on average for the first nine months of the year. A key component which explains part of the increase in services inflation is the strong growth in rent prices. Rent inflation averaged 6.4 per cent last year, a slight moderation from the 6.7 per cent increase in 2017. This decline in rent inflation has continued into 2019 with rent inflation of 5.5 per cent on average for the nine months of 2019. The high level of rent prices partially reflects the shortage of housing at present, a key concern of Government. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for tackling housing issues is set out in Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. The primary objective of the plan is to increase overall housing supply to a more sustainable level of around 25,000 homes per year by 2020. The Government has committed to spending over &euro;6 billion out to 2021 to implement the plan.</p></reply>

This was achieved by allowing Ministers of State to use their own cars for official purposes and to employ civilian drivers instead of being supplied with &lsquo;State Cars&rsquo; and Garda drivers. In 2011, this measure was further extended and it was decided that:</p>  <p>  a) The President, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice and Law Reform should continue to be provided with Garda transport and drivers, for security reasons in line with the recommendations of the Garda Commissioner:</p>  <p>  b) The Chief Justice, by virtue of his position, should also have a Garda car and driver;</p>  <p>  c) The Director of Public Prosecutions should be provided with Garda transport and protection commensurate with his security profile but this should not be an ex officio entitlement;</p>  <p>  d) With the exception of the four members of the Government mentioned in subparagraph a) the arrangements currently in place for Ministers of State should apply for all Ministers, the Attorney General and the Ceann Comhairle.</p>  <p>  At the time of the original decision, it was considered that for security purposes and to facilitate the very heavy travelling requirements associated with their office, it was essential for Ministers of State to be allowed to use larger cars. These conditions are reflected in the allocation of a rate for an engine capacity of 2001cc and over for Ministers of State.  Since 2011 the same arrangements apply to Ministers.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Climate Action Plan it is intended to review rates for electric vehicles with a view to introducing civil service mileage rates for electric vehicles reflecting the costs incurred by drivers using their own vehicles for work on behalf of the State. In addition, the next periodic review of civil service mileage rates is scheduled to take place in 2020 and all relevant factors will be taken into account in the context of this review.</p></reply>

The establishment of the scheme fulfils one of the requirements of Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan; and Action 14 of the People Strategy for the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  The scheme is being introduced on a phased basis. Phase 1 of the scheme went live in 2018 and 2019. This phase is for the general Civil Service grades of Clerical Officer (CO) and Executive Officer (EO) to apply for mobility between and within 46 zones. The location choices for the scheme are based on mobility zones (46 zones) rather than by county or province. </p>  <p>  There has been a high level of interest in the scheme with c.4,700 staff members (24% of the total participating grades) applying for a move through the scheme with:</p>  <p>  - the majority of applicants c.2,860 applying for a move either within a regional zone or between regional zones;</p>  <p>  - c.1,040 of the applicants applying to move from Zone 46 (Dublin) to a regional location &ndash; representing 12% of the staff in the participating grades in Zone 46;</p>  <p>  c.800 staff based in Zone 46 applying for Mobility within the same Zone.</p>  <p>  Over 350 moves have taken place since the scheme went live with other moves currently in progress.</p>  <p>  Plans are in place to extend the scheme in 2020 to include the grades of Higher Executive Officer, Administrative Officer and Assistant Principal. When this process is complete, mobility will be in place for general Civil Service grades from Clerical Officer up to Principal Officer. </p>  <p>  The scheme provides for cross organisational moves within a location that were not previously possible under the former transfer mechanisms that it has replaced. This means that staff members are given opportunities to work closer to home and also to further their career development. The mobility of experienced staff members across the system also supports the business needs of Civil Service organisations.</p>  <p>  To date, it should be noted that approximately 75% of the applicants have initially declined an offer to move to a zone that they selected as their preferred location. This would suggest that the actual number of staff members who would move from Dublin to other zones is lower than the number of current applicants [c.1,040].  We will continue to monitor this trend.</p>  <p>  Following the full roll out of the Civil Service Mobility Scheme, it is the intention to review and extend mobility over time to provide additional development opportunities and enable greater mobility across the Public Service.</p></reply>

This analysis is being carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group which contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. Work is ongoing by this group and significant progress has been made. I am confident that the culmination of this analysis will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need. Until this analysis is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.  It is also not possible to estimate associated costs until this process is complete as costs depend on the levels of disadvantage and enrolments in individual schools and the level of resources to be provided.</p></reply>

Securing the future of small schools is a priority for me as Minister for Education and Skills.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has provided for improved teacher staffing levels for small schools. This measure will see a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher.</p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the appointment and retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and more favourable enrolment thresholds for one teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  Small schools have also benefitted from the 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule for all schools implemented in 2016 and again in 2018.  The staffing schedule at primary level currently operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.</p>  <p>  In addition, the staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific appeal measure for small schools, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p></reply>

Due to the downturn in the economy, the scale of the project could not be accommodated within the capital allocation available and the project did not proceed. In the decade since the original plan, international research has tended to favour smaller prisons within reach of support communities as the best option for rehabilitation. In addition, in light of the decision not to proceed with Thornton Hall, significant capital investment was made at the Mountjoy campus over recent years to upgrade accommodation.</p>  <p>  Thornton Hall site remains in State ownership. </p>  <p>  I understand from the Irish Prison Service that no requests for the temporary use of the site by community groups have been received by the IPS to date. </p>  <p>  In recent years a working group, which included representatives from the OPW, considered future use options for the site. This included discussions with Fingal County Council.  The site has also been flagged to the Department of Housing and Local Government, and to the Land Development Agency.  As such, proposals for the site will be considered both in the context of broader State requirements for land assets as well as any future requirements in relation to detention of prisoners.</p></reply>

The review, entitled &quot;Combating Racism and Xenophobia through the Criminal Law&quot;, was conducted by the Centre for Criminal Justice, University of Limerick, in conjunction with the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. This review was published in September 2008.</p><p>As set out in my previous reply, the review concluded that &ldquo;the complex nature of the offences in the 1989 Act arises primarily from the overriding need to balance fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression, privacy and basic principles of criminal liability, with the need to protect individuals and groups against vicious racist abuse&rdquo;.  </p><p>The 2008 review recommended that legislative change alone would be insufficient and that measures to address racism should be included as part of an overall integration and anti-racism strategy, including education and public awareness programmes and a wide range of measures to ensure migrant and minority communities are more included in Irish society.</p><p>Among other conclusions and recommendations, the review:</p><p>-  identified a need for guidance for judges so that they consider racism as an aggravating factor deserving a tougher sentence.</p><p>-  recommended an update to the Act specifically to include &ldquo;racism on the internet&rdquo;.</p><p>-  recommended that those involved in the Courts, the Police and the administration should be trained on the full extent and potential of all existing legislation to deal with racism.</p><p>-  cautioned against introducing specific &lsquo;aggravated offences&rsquo;, expressing the view that these would be too difficult to prove.</p><p>-  calls for stronger &lsquo;flanking measures&rsquo; to support effective implementation of existing legislation, including:</p><p>1.  A detailed Annual Report from Garda&iacute; on crimes involving racism</p><p>2.  The systematic monitoring and reporting of cases involving racism by the Courts Service</p><p>3.  Additional resources for the Garda&iacute; and the training of &lsquo;ethnic liaison officers&rsquo;</p><p>4.  Establishment of consultative forums across all Garda Divisions to liaise with minority communities</p><p>5.  Initiatives to encourage reporting of crimes</p><p>6.  Support for victims&rsquo; bodies including adequate training</p><p>7.  The requirement for all local authorities to include policies to address racism in their strategic planning process.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the majority of these recommendations have been implemented in the intervening period.</p><p>The Department keeps all legislation under review on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The review of the 1989 Act being conducted at present by my Department is designed to identify how our legislation on hate speech, including incitement to hatred, can be made fit for purpose in a modern democracy. This review is one part of a suite of measures which will include the development of new legislation on both hate speech and hate crime.</p><p>As part of the review, I launched a public consultation process on 24 October, which is open and will gather the views of communities, experts and all interested persons on how our incitement legislation should be changed to make it fit for purpose. Details of the consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The consultation runs until 13 December 2019 and I encourage all those who wish to contribute to go to the Department&rsquo;s website at www.justice.ie for further information.</p><p>Separately to the work on incitement, my Department is finalising research on the effectiveness of the different legislative approaches to tackling hate crime in other countries, in order to learn from experience elsewhere and use this information to identify the approach that will be most suitable for Ireland. When this research has concluded I will bring forward proposals for new hate crime legislation. These will be published and the views of experts, communities and the public will be taken into account.</p><p>This work is complemented by the work of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, who are preparing legislation in relation to the regulation of tech companies in respect of harmful content. This provision for a regulator to oversee online safety, which has been widely discussed and is in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission Report. This legislation is where issues such as codes of conduct for tech companies, requirements to put measures in place to deal with harmful content and so forth will be dealt with.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that this is a complex area but the approach being taken - including research and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to provide their views through consultation - will help to ensure that the legislation we develop will deliver a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone. </p><p>Finally, alongside the criminal law, my Department has also been responsible for bringing forward a number of inclusion strategies which are designed to promote equality and inclusion and to tackle discrimination and prejudice.  These strategies include the Migrant Integration Strategy 2017-2020, the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, the LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy 2018-2020 and the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020. We will shortly launch a National LGBTI+ Strategy. The Progress Report for the mid-term review of the Migrant Integration Strategy identified the need for strong actions to combat racism and these are currently being advanced.</p></reply>

In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified. </p>  <p>  The Irish exporting landscape is strong and companies in Ireland are succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services.  Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved record levels of exports in 2018 of &euro;23.8bn, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. In 2018, the Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 7.6% to &euro;4.8bn, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1bn in exports.  Exports to North America increased from &euro;3.87bn in 2017 to &euro;4.08bn in 2018, an increase of 5.5%.  Our Enterprise agencies are now opening new offices around the world to support our companies in competing and thriving in global markets.  </p>  <p>  Ministerial-led Trade Missions support the Government's major drive towards market diversification.  The majority of trade missions are taking place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represent the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies.   These Trade Missions focus on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences.</p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more. The existing suite of EU Free Trade Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-13a.324.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111300064#WRF01300"><p>Regional development remains a key priority of mine as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Together with my Department and its enterprise Agencies, I am focused on strengthening investment and job creation all over the country. In 2018, 56% of all net new jobs created by IDA Ireland were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland, including the South-East region, posted net gains in jobs last year. </p>  <p>  When it comes to foreign direct investment (FDI), site visits do represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas. However, as I have said before, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. In 2018, there were three site visits to County Wexford while Carlow and Kilkenny hosted seven and five site visits respectively. Site visits to these counties are trending in the right direction with four site visits to Wexford, seven site visits to Carlow and 12 site visits to Kilkenny as of the third quarter of this year. </p>  <p>  The overall outlook for FDI is positive for Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny. In 2018, there was a 5% increase in employment by IDA client companies in Wexford with 152 net new jobs added last year. Carlow has witnessed a 31% increase in FDI employment with 275 net new jobs added last year. While there were no new FDI-supported jobs created in Kilkenny in 2018, it is encouraging to note a number of recent announcements by Security Risk Advisors and AB Agri with both companies planning to create 50 new jobs each.</p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping to generating new investment in Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny, the Government remains determined to attract more FDI to the South-East region. The work of the IDA is obviously key in that respect and the Agency's staff will continue engaging with its clients, as well as the other enterprise agencies, to help create more jobs and economic opportunities.</p></reply>

These favourable growing conditions allowed for ample quantities of fodder to be conserved. This is supported by the fact that fodder prices throughout 2019 were significantly depressed on 2018 prices indicating adequate supplies. </p>  <p>  Whilst it is not possible to predict the duration or severity of the coming winter and its resultant impact on fodder availability, I am satisfied that there are currently sufficient stocks of fodder available.

Transitional measures such as this are normal between programming periods where a gap arises due to the challenging nature of finalising the new EU Budget and CAP regulations, which require unanimous agreement.   </p>  <p>  The proposals provide for a one-year transition period in 2021.  Funding arrangements for transition are based on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the new EU Multiannual Financial Framework. My officials are currently examining the proposals, which will be discussed in Brussels in the coming months and are to be agreed with the European Parliament.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the existing rules and financial arrangements for CAP, including the EU Budget allocations for the period 2014-2020, will apply for 2020, as set out in the relevant CAP regulations for both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2.</p>  <p>  My key priority remains to continue to press for agreement on the CAP reform proposals and on the maintenance of the CAP budget as part of the EU Multiannual Financial Framework. </p>  <p>  Since the launch of the proposals on the Multiannual Financial Framework, I have worked closely with other Agriculture Ministers to seek to maintain the level of CAP funding for the EU 27 and to reverse the cuts. From the start of this process, I joined with my colleagues in Madrid in May 2018 and together with France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland signed a Memorandum to call for the maintenance of the CAP budget.  </p>  <p>  Work on this initiative has continued and, most recently, at the October Agrifish Council, I again joined with my colleagues across Europe when 17 Member States joined a declaration seeking to maintain CAP funding in the period post-2020.  I will continue to work with my European counterparts to fight for a strong CAP budget, and to ensure the best possible outcome for Irish farmers from the CAP post-2020 negotiation process.</p></reply>

As a first step, the purchase of single use plastics has been banned throughout the public service. We are determined to increase recycling of plastics from 37% now to 55% in the coming years and, along with other EU member states, to phase out non-recyclable plastics entirely. A Deposit and Return Scheme is one option proposed for EU member states to consider as a means of increasing the collection of plastic beverage containers and achieve the new 90% target for this waste stream identified in the Single Use Plastic Directive.</p>  <p>  A number of grass roots community initiatives are emerging across the country which support responsible waste management, which I welcome. However, the introduction of a new national initiative such as a Deposit and Return Scheme needs to be fully understood and the costs and impacts identified to make evidence-based decision making. In January this year I announced a national study which will consider how we can deliver a 90% collection target for single use beverage containers, including plastic bottles in Ireland. This study will also examine the possibility of introducing a Deposit and Return Scheme and how this might operate in an Irish context. This study will be completed in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

One of the Plan deliverables will be the development of a support policy for micro-generation, which will provide a pathway to the public to participate in and benefit from this transition. Action 30 of the Plan sets out the steps necessary and timelines for the delivery of an enabling framework for micro-generation by June 2021. A Microgeneration working group has been established with the participation of the Department of Agriculture and consideration of the work programme is underway. The Group will assess possible mechanisms for payment of exported electricity by renewable self-consumers for each market segment including agriculture.</p>  <p>  In July 2018 my Department launched a new micro-generation grant scheme to support domestic customers who install solar photovoltaic panels in their homes. The pilot scheme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, was subject to a review in recent months. The SEAI indicate that of the 2,500 applications made to date, over 1,400 successful installations have been completed to a value in excess of &euro;3 million in funding. Additionally, 28 farms have applied for support from the TAMS scheme for Solar PV installations. </p>  <p>  The Smart Meter Upgrade is a meter replacement programme which will result in the upgrade of over 2 million meters to modern, smart-ready technology. When the programme completes in Ireland in 2024, all domestic and business premises will have a new modern meter installed. The upgrade to smart meters will encourage energy efficiency, support an increase in renewable power on the energy system, and result in lower overall costs for consumers. The installation of smart meters is a key enabler for the energy transition to a decarbonised system and will support the market for micro-generation as outlined in the Government's Climate Action Plan.</p></reply>

For the purposes of the departments activation services all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register, aged between 18 and 61 years old inclusive, are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years etc.). Selection for referral to receive employment activation services from a JobPath provider is by means of system based stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long term cohort on the Live Register.  </p>  <p>  The duration of a person's jobseekers claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment, any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks are considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment - this is known as linking the claims. Long-term jobseekers that may have left the live register to go into employment for less than a year are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within that 52 week period.</p>  <p>  The linking of claims allows the client to retain certain entitlements (for example no waiting days and other supplemental benefits) and they are also available for selection for activation services including JobPath. </p>  <p>  For those people who are referred to the JobPath service after a short period of work, the support and assistance of their personal advisor will ensure that the skills and experience they have gained in the job are built on if necessary and, that they are factored into all future job applications.  </p>  <p>  Between July 2015 and October 2019, some 244,219 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service. Of this number some 33,360 or approximately 14% were working part time &amp;amp; in receipt of a jobseekers payment.</p>  <p>  JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the companies. JobPath providers receive a registration fee each time they register a jobseeker for the service. However the Jobseeker may be withdrawn from the service if they have a change of circumstances. Some common examples of a change of circumstances are for jobseekers to avail of a back to education opportunity or move to another payment, for example disability allowance, illness benefit or carer&rsquo;s allowance. If after their education course has finished they remain unemployed they may be re-registered to a JobPath provider.  Clients who move address to an area operated by a different provider of the JobPath service will also be re-registered to the new JobPath provider. Registration fees are only incurred when a client engages with the JobPath service and agrees a personal progression plan. </p>  <p>  Between July 2015 and October 2019, 156,787 registration fees have been paid for clients who have been referred once. In the same time period 81,714 registration fees have been paid for 40,857 jobseekers who have had two referrals, of which 27,920 jobseekers were those referred after completing a full previous engagement with the service. The balance of 12,937, were withdrawn from JobPath due to their circumstances changing but subsequently re-referred as they reinstated their jobseekers claim. </p>  <p>  4,908 registration fees have been paid for 1,636 jobseekers who have had three referrals, of which 1,330 were those referred after completing two full previous engagements with the service. Lastly there have been 32 registration fees paid for 8 jobseekers who have had four referrals to JobPath, none of whom have previously completed three full engagements with JobPath.</p></reply>

The Council considers visual arts to include a range of media such as painting, drawing, sculpture, printmaking, photography, live art/performance, film, video or other digital imaging media.</p><p>The Arts Council is dedicated to supporting a vibrant community of visual artists, visual arts groups and organisations so that the public can experience the highest standard of visual arts, in urban and in rural parts of Ireland. </p><p>The Arts Council offers various funding awards under the Visual Arts for artists, organisations, groups and curators to apply for support. In addition to the grants, awards and schemes offered across all artform areas, a number of schemes and initiatives have been established for the particular support of visual arts. Information on these can be accessed on the Arts Council's website at the following link  .</p><p>In addition to the above, Culture Ireland operates a range of funding programmes to support and promote the presentation of Irish arts internationally.  Under its programme it offers support to Irish professional artists, arts organisations and international presenters to present work by Irish artists at significant international venues and festivals. Culture Ireland considers applications for all forms of the arts, including photography, as defined in the Arts Act 2003:  Further information on funding can be accessed at the following link .</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Creative Ireland Programme is a five-year all-of-government, culture-based initiative, led by my Department, that emphasises the importance of human creativity for individual, community and societal wellbeing.  The main source of support for community-based activities under the Creative Ireland Programme is Pillar 2 - 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community'.  In 2019, a total of &euro;3m has been allocated to all 31 local authorities (&euro;96,000 each approximately) to enable them to support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county.  In 2018, over 1,200 events took place across all local authorities.  Projects funded include arts projects, grant schemes, concerts, conferences, exhibitions, festivals, outreach projects, publications, research programmes, and workshops among other activities. They cover topics such as archaeology, architecture, biodiversity, crafts, heritage, dance, film, history, literature, music, photography, poetry, storytelling, theatre and the visual arts.</p><p>In July of this year, I announced the completion of a review of the Percent for Art scheme which will  be of interest to visual artists.  The outcome of this review led to changes to the scheme&rsquo;s bands and limits which will make significantly increased funding available to the creative community. Many artists have already received high profile commissions for public art works as a result of this scheme and these increases will ensure many more will also benefit. The new limits and bands will apply from 1st January 2020 and details may be seen on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link .</p><p>I will shortly be re-establishing an inter-agency group to improve information gathering and collation and sharing of best practice on Percent for Art schemes.  This group will also link in with the Arts Council and seek to enhance the Council&rsquo;s existing advisory role in relation to the Scheme.</p><p>My Department may from time to time have limited resources available to consider the provision of small amounts of funding for projects that promote the goals and actions contained in the National Biodiversity Action Plan, with a preferred emphasis on projects that have a scientific, monitoring or awareness raising element.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, my Department is committed to the active management of this species within the National Park and, as part of its regular ongoing management operations, carries out localised annual species' counts on State lands, where appropriate. A number of surveys, censuses and reports on the species population have been conducted in recent years, including a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure in Killarney National Park. This was followed by further census in both the spring 2017 and winter 2018.  Preliminary reported results indicate that the population density of one breed is in the region of 11.31 per square kilometre (c. 896 ) and the density of the other breed  is in the region of 6.71 per square kilometre (c. 532 ). </p>  <p>  As a result of the  population increasing, certain management issues arise, such as culling. The animals have the potential to impact significantly on woodlands, including the iconic yew, oak and also wet woodlands within the Park, for example by bark stripping of mature trees and preventing regeneration. Therefore, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by them to habitats, culls need to be carried out to ensure that populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences. More than 240 animals were culled between 2015 and 2018. The figures for the 2018-19 cull  totalled 272 animals which included both breeds. The cull for the 2019-2020 season is just underway in line with the current Open Season order.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy can see, our management of the species in the National Park is extensive and appropriate. However, as I have repeatedly informed the Deputy, management of animals outside of the National Park and in the wider Killarney valley area is a matter for private landholders and culling and control  is not the responsibility of my Department, beyond the issuing of section 42 permits.</p>  <p>  While the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department licenses the hunting of the animals, the Department does not own the  population, they are wild animals and they roam freely throughout the countryside. Wild animals in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts, however, there is an annual open season during which this species can be legally shot under licence. The open season operates generally from the 1st September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender. Landowners may also apply to the Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull  where necessary outside the annual open seasons. These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case-by-case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual animals on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of fencing Killarney National Park as I have previously outlined on several occasions, there are no plans to fence the National Park. Fencing is simply not a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons. Firstly, the presence of the species is not confined to the National Parks and consequently fencing of these properties would serve no practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management. Secondly, the Park is over 10.000 ha in size, including some rugged terrain. Fencing this area would be an enormous task that is unlikely to result in the desired objective. Thirdly, some smaller animals are capable of going under fencing that is eight inches off the ground, while others are capable of knocking down fences. Finally, the erection of a fence this size could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the Park.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of Road Safety, this is a matter for the Road Safety Authority and the relevant Local authority. Nevertheless, I am of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved (possibly larger) signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists to be vigilant when driving through areas where populations of the animals can be expected. Officials from my Department have previously discussed this with Kerry County Council.</p>  <p>  To conclude, the Deputy can appreciate that species management is a complex and multi-faceted process. There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that  populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.</p></reply>
