This data on the number and percentage of persons employed, both in the Department and in public bodies under its aegis, was compiled via an all-staff census as at 31<sup>st</sup>December 2020. This data is based on self-declaration of disability, by staff who disclosed having a disability. </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Department </th>       <th>Total Number of employees</th>       <th>Number of employees with a disability</th>       <th>% of employees with a disability</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</td>       <td>923 </td>       <td>43 </td>       <td>4.66 </td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>Name of public body</th>       <th>Total Number of employees</th>       <th>Number of employees with a disability</th>       <th>% of employees with a disability</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Competition &amp;amp; Consumer Protection Commission</td>       <td>120 </td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>6.67 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland</td>       <td>672 </td>       <td>21 </td>       <td>3.13 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>The Health and Safety Authority</td>       <td>190 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>6.84 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IDA Ireland</td>       <td>359 </td>       <td>21 </td>       <td>5.85 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>InterTrade Ireland</td>       <td>57 </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>5.26 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NSAI </td>       <td>164 </td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>4.27 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PIAB </td>       <td>80 </td>       <td>6 </td>       <td>7.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>*Science Foundation Ireland</td>       <td>89 </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>3.37 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Science Foundation Ireland, while not one of the Department agencies since the change of Government in 2020 was included in 2020 return and is shown in the table.</p><p>IAASA, one of our 8 agencies is not subject to the provisions of the Disability Acts as it is not a &lsquo;public body&rsquo; as defined in the 2005 Act.</p><p>My Department's current policy regarding the employment of persons with disabilities is based on implementing the goals of the national policy. The 3% target is set out in Section 47 of the Disability Act 2005. The commitment to increase this target to 6% by 2024 is set out in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future.</p><p>My Department as a public service employer has a legal obligation under the Disability Act 2005 to, insofar as practicable, take all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities. </p><p>My Department has in place a dedicated Disability Liaison Officer who acts as a proactive contact for staff with disabilities, to assist and support them, and to assist in the implementation of best Human Resource practices in line with equality legislation. This role also includes the organisation of work placements in my Department for people with disabilities, specifically for the Willing and Mentoring (WAM) project. This project provides the opportunity for people with disabilities to gain experience in different workplaces through coaching and mentoring, as well as building the capacity of employers to integrate disability into the workplace. There are currently 4 graduates participating in work placements in my Department as part of the WAM Programme.</p><p>Also in place is a Disability Monitoring Committee, which serves to monitor the number of employees within my Department and Agencies who have declared a disability, ensure compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, and share best practice to support those with disabilities in our workplaces. Through this Committee we have recently established an annual online and confidential census to more accurately measure our progress against national targets. </p><p>Further to this, we established a Disability Consultative Committee in 2018. The purpose of the DCC is to provide a focus for disability inclusion in respect of the policy work, schemes and initiatives of the Department.  Membership of the Group includes nominated representatives of disability groups along with Departmental officials and representatives from the Department&rsquo;s Offices and Agencies. The DCC also reviews my Department&rsquo;s actions under the 'Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with a Disability 2015-24'.</p><p>My Department also places a focus on learning and development opportunities that support people with disabilities in the workplace. This includes a recently launched Disability Awareness Training Programme, which seeks to increase the understanding of inclusion and diversity in the workplace. This training focuses on accommodating people with disabilities into the workforce and providing an understanding of inclusion in the workforce. Participants who successfully complete the course and obtain a pass mark obtain a 2-year certificate in Disability Awareness.</p><p>The Department has not advertised a competition in relation to the quota. My Department draws the majority of its required resources from the Public Appointments Service (PAS). The Public Appointments Service has a central  role to play in recruiting diverse talent to take up public  service employment opportunities. The PAS launched an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy in 2021 <i>PASEDIStrategyDocument.pdf (publicjobs.ie)</i>and my Department welcomes and fully supports this initiative.</p></reply>

This pilot scheme has proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector and the quota of 150 employment permits is now exhausted. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the employment permits system is responsive to changes in economic circumstances and labour market conditions, it is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit. The lists are subject to twice yearly reviews which are evidence based and are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, a public consultation process, input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.  Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19 and their impact on the labour market.</p>  <p>  A further review of the occupation lists is underway and the closing date for submissions from stakeholders was 12th  August. Any submission by the sector to this review will be considered and it is envisaged that it will be finalised in the early Autumn. </p></reply>

The Technology Gateway Programme seeks to harness the innovation and technological expertise in the Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities for the benefit of Irish based industry on a regional and national basis. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Technology Gateway Programme has established a nationwide network of 16 industry-focused Gateways in the Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Gateways act as open access points for companies delivering near to market solutions across industry sectors such as ICT &amp;amp; Software, Bio Lifesciences &amp;amp; Food, and Precision Engineering and Materials. The Gateways act as a portal to the wider research infrastructure of personnel and specialised equipment within the network of Gateways.  </p><p>MET, PEM and DESIGN+ were added to the network in 2016. The Centre for Renewable Energy at Dundalk Institute of Technology (CREDIT) is the newest Technology Gateway, launched in March 2021.  The initial funding will allow CREDIT Technology Gateway to set up and staff the Gateway with a view to joining the other Gateways in re-applying for funding when a new programme is announced.</p><p>Technology Gateway funding is allocated over five-year programme streams and the total amount allocated to each Gateway, to date, is shown in the table below.  Shannon ABC is a shared Gateway and is based in Munster Technological University (Tralee) and Limerick Institute of Technology.

In 2020, over 81% of all documents filed with CRO were filed online. Online filing has increased to 88% so far in 2021, largely due to the introduction of a new IT system in December 2020, which significantly increased the range of documents that can be filed electronically with the CRO. The new IT system is designed to provide improved and faster user experience for presenters and a fully paperless interaction with the CRO for certain transactions, including the most common ones carried out by companies such as the filing of annual returns and the changing of directors and their details. The introduction of a fully paperless system for these transactions provides certainty of delivery for companies and eliminates the need for CRO staff to scan and upload related paper documents. </p>  <p>  The CRO receives, processes and registers over 170 form types, covering all aspects of the lifecycle of a company and provides regular updates of current processing times for the most frequently filed forms on the CRO website and via Twitter.</p>  <p>  I understand that some forms and documents are still received by the CRO in paper format and that there are no particular delays in scanning or uploading this material. I have been informed that, in general, such documents are input into the system by the CRO within 72 hours of receipt.  </p></reply>

Employment rights legislation was strengthened by the commencement, on 4th March 2019, of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018.</p><p>The Act delivered on the Programme for Government commitment to address the challenges of the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious employment.</p><p>The Act of 2018 provides that:</p><p>employers must give to employees their core terms of employment within five days of starting work;</p><p>zero hours contracts are restricted to situations where the work is of a genuinely casual, emergency or short-term relief nature;</p><p>there are minimum payments for people when they are called into work, but sent home without work;</p><p>a 'band of hours' system has been introduced whereby an employee can request to be placed on a contract that better reflects the hours they have worked over a 12 month reference period;</p><p>Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 (OWTA) was amended to prohibit zero hour contracts except in the following circumstances:</p><p>-Where the work is of a casual nature;</p><p>-Where the work is done in emergency circumstances; or</p><p>-Short-term relief work to cover routine absences for the employer.</p><p>There are strong anti-penalisation provisions, including recourse to the Workplace Relations Commission, for employees who invoke their rights under this legislation.</p><p>In relation to sick pay, the Government is committed to introducing legislation to cover all employees and work is well underway in this regard. The Sick Leave Bill 2021 will be designed to take an incremental approach with the number of sick days to be paid to workers increasing gradually over a number of years. This is to give employers, particularly businesses who may have had to close or been negatively impacted due to Covid-19 restrictions, an opportunity to adjust to costs and the administrative burden. In line with statutory sick pay schemes throughout the European Union, the intention is that employers will cover the cost of an initial period where one of their employees is unable to work due to illness or injury.  It is intended that the legislation will be in place by 2022. </p></reply>

They then have a further 56 days in which to complete their filing with the Companies Registration Office. As a consequence, annual returns are filed on an ongoing basis throughout the year. However, a significant number of companies have a financial year end of 31<sup>st</sup>December, a resulting annual return date (ARD) of 30<sup>th</sup>September the following year and a deadline of 25<sup>th</sup>November by which the filing of the annual return must be completed with the CRO. </p><p>Since March 2020, the Registrar of Companies has taken a number of decisions in relation to the filing of annual returns, in recognition of the additional challenges facing some companies and their professional advisers in meeting filing obligations during the Covid-19 period. These exceptional arrangements are at an end and normal timeframes now apply in relation to filing. </p><p>The filing of annual returns has continued throughout the period of Covid-19 related disruption, with particularly heavy volumes in the run up to the filing deadlines last October and more recently at end May/early June.  A new IT system was also introduced in December 2020, which includes a more streamlined online process for filing annual returns and eliminates the need to deliver hardcopy material to the CRO. I understand that over 155,000 annual returns have been filed with the CRO so far this year.  </p><p>I understand that the Registrar of Companies is not planning any further extension of filing deadlines given the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, the ongoing level of successful filing and the importance of having an up-to-date Register for those stakeholders who regularly access company filings.</p></reply>

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  </p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.  </p>  <p>  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by the Department and of the relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the most recent review, it was decided to remove the occupation of healthcare assistant (in hospital and residential care establishments) from the Ineligible Occupations List. The review did not recommend extending eligibility to care worker/home carers as the evidence suggests that other factors, such as the contracts of employment on offer and employment terms and conditions being offered are a factor in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage.  The sector has also previously been advised that a more systematic and structured engagement with the Department of Social Protection needs to be demonstrated.</p>  <p>  If a sector wishes to propose a change to the occupations lists, they need to submit a detailed evidence based business case to substantiate their request. A review is currently underway, with submissions received, including submissions from the Home Care sector, under consideration. It is expected that the review will be finalised by the end of September/early October. </p></reply>

It was advertised extensively both nationally and locally as well as across social media. The Scheme was initially intended to provide grants in tandem with the phased re-opening of the economy as per the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap. As the Roadmap was accelerated, so too was the scheme available to all eligible businesses and sectors.</p><p>The numbers of applications nationally had begun to taper off as we considered introducing an expanded Restart Scheme with higher grant levels. As the Government decided to introduce the higher grant levels, to the benefit of a much larger group of businesses, it was decided to end the original scheme. The Restart Grant Plus Scheme was launched in August 2020, with increased minimum and maximum grants available to a larger cohort of businesses.</p><p>Businesses, for whichever reason, that were unable to apply for the original Restart Grant scheme were entitled to submit an appeal to their Local Authority. In this context it is important to note that for the purposes of the Restart Grant and Restart Grant Plus schemes, each Local Authority was the decision-making body and the appeals body, so individual appeals were directed in the first instance to their respective Local Authority, noting the circumstances/reasons for the particular appeal.</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that, of the total 123,380 applications for the Restart Schemes operated by the 31 Local Authorities on behalf of my Department, 108,634 applications were approved and paid. 14,746 were not approved.  The funding provided to

Originally, these were France, Germany, and the UK. The UK, which had ratified in April 2018, announced in February 2020 following Brexit, that it would not be participating in the UPCA. This led to a revision of the three contracting states to France, Germany, and Italy. To date, 16 Member States have ratified the Agreement including France and Italy. Germany has yet to ratify the Agreement. In addition, with the withdrawal of the UK, two further MS have to ratify it before the Unified Patent Court can come into force.</p>  <p>  Ireland would have to hold a successful referendum before ratifying the Agreement. A decision on the holding of a referendum on this issue will be kept under review in the context of the timing of the coming into force of the UPC.  Consideration of issues in relation to the potential location of local and central divisions of the UPC in Ireland would have to await the outcome of any referendum.  </p></reply>

In October 2020, the DETE Management Board approved the launch of the &lsquo;ConnEcTEd Teams&rsquo; pilot programme with the aim of identifying and promoting behaviours that support effective remote/ blended working for teams.  The programme targets five key areas:</p><p>1.Maintaining team/ organisation-wide connectedness and trust;</p><p>2.Ensuring effective and efficient information flows;</p><p>3.Enabling continued on-the-job training and coaching activities;</p><p>4.Facilitating remote collaboration and innovation; and</p><p>5.Supporting employee wellbeing.</p><p>The most significant element of the ConnEcTEd Teams initiative is our project involving pilot teams from seven Divisions across the Department, representative of all grades and locations. Each of the teams underwent a process to identify and implement actions that could positively impact their remote/blended team working behaviours. Senior leaders from across the Department also participated in facilitated sessions that focussed on building a shared understanding of the strategic opportunities and challenges presented by blended working for DETE. It identified the skills required to be effective leaders in a hybrid work environment.</p><p>Based on the insights gained from the programme, our HR team is preparing a report which will present a menu of actions for consideration by individuals, teams, people managers and leaders seeking to embed effective blended team working behaviours. The report will highlight areas where the Department can focus its efforts to support blended working at an organisation-wide level (e.g. orientation, people manager supports, network creation, virtual collaboration training). The ConnEcTEd Teams project report, when approved by the Department&rsquo;s Management Board, will be shared across the Civil and Public service with the intention that other organisations may learn from the process and insights uncovered.</p><p>In line with Government policy the Department has issued communications to staff and is convening planned information sessions to address questions and concerns that staff may have as we plan a phased return to the office from 20 September. The Department sees a phased return to the office, in all locations over the next three-six months, thus enabling staff a gradual return as measures are put in place during the pandemic to manage work/life commitments are recalibrated to meet the needs of the Department post pandemic.</p></reply>

Under the Climate Action Plan, a Micro-Generation working group, chaired by my Department, is developing an enabling framework for micro-generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments.</p><p>  My Department outlined proposals for a new Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) in a public consultation that closed on 18 February last. A summary report of the submissions received has been published on my Department's website.</p><p>  While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is intended that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers later  this year, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with transposition of Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. </p><p>  It is expected that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will publish a draft framework in the coming weeks which will outline the details, including eligibility criteria and timescales for introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee payment for exported renewable electricity.  This framework will outline the approach to the rate of remuneration under the CEG, as determining such matters is the responsibility of the CRU. This would give effect to the above-mentioned articles and allow for the commencement of export payments to micro- and small-scale generators, by their suppliers.</p><p>Further to the public consultation referred to above, my Department is developing a final scheme design for the MSS which incorporates feedback from the consultation and subsequent additional analysis. It is envisaged that a proposal on the supports to be offered to homeowners, farms, schools and businesses under the MSS, which may include grants or premium tariff payments for new installations, will be submitted to Government later this year.</p></reply>

Since 2000, over 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light.</p><p>Building Regulations have been progressively strengthened and new buildings must now meet very high energy performance standards. Homes constructed since 2006 are generally more energy efficient than those built before due to energy performance requirements of the 2003 Building Regulations. For this reason, there is no grant incentive for residential insulation and heating controls for houses built and occupied after 2006. However, grant funding for renewable energy measures are available to homes built before 2011.</p><p>There are currently no plans to change the date of eligibility for SEAI insulation and heating controls grant assistance for homes built and occupied after 2006.</p><p>It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were chosen as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners at the best value for money for the Exchequer. </p><p>Full details on the application processes for all schemes operated by the SEAI are available at <i>www.seai.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The CRU has the duty to monitor electricity supplies and to take such measures as it considers necessary to protect security of supply. It is assisted in its statutory role by EirGrid, Irelands&rsquo; electricity transmission system operator, which is required to report to the CRU with regard to security of electricity supply matters. EirGrid is also responsible for the day-to-day management of the electricity transmission system. </p>  <p>  The CRU and EirGrid have advised that they have identified specific challenges to ensuring continued electricity security of supply, which they are currently in the process of addressing, including  : lower than expected availability of some existing power stations; anticipated new power stations not being developed as planned; expected growth in demand for electricity including due to the growth of data centres; and the expected closure of power stations that make up approximately 25% of conventional electricity generation capacity over time. Our decarbonisation commitments must proceed while addressing these challenges.</p>  <p>  A range of actions is being taken by the CRU and EirGrid in relation to security of electricity supply over the coming winter and years ahead. These actions being progressed include: maximising the availability of existing generators; development of new generation capacity; making changes to the grid connection rules for data centres,  and working with large energy consumers to, where possible, reduce their electricity demand during peak periods. My Department is working closely with the CRU and EirGrid in order to progress these actions.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the closure of two of the three peat-fired power stations in the midlands was a result of the ESB not securing planning permission from the relevant planning authority for their future operation. The third peat-fired power station, owned by Bord na Mona, is currently in the process of seeking planning permission to operate beyond 2023. </p></reply>

I am advised by NBI that, as of 27 August, over 249,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed with over 92,000 premises under construction.  </p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays to aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors, restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally).  Covid 19 has affected the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff have been at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have had to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. The full extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in so far as possible.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. The Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19. As part of that work NBI is engaging with all current build partners to bring forward build activities and is also actively reviewing other possible build partners where such options could also speed up the build process. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at </p><p><i>nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</i></p><p>The National Broadband Plan State led intervention has been designed to ensure that as much as possible of the network infrastructure will comprise the re-use of existing poles and ducts, which NBI will lease from existing infrastructure owners. Infrastructure re-use in this manner ensures the State complies with State Aid guidelines and environmental sustainability best practice. </p><p>Deployment of the NBP has the potential to deliver a range of environmental benefits linked to Government policy and cloud services as well as reduced emissions from teleworking and business travel. The Cost Benefit Analysis behind the business case for the Government decision to proceed with the NBP highlighted environmental benefits among a variety of other economic and social benefits.  However it did not set out to specifically forecast the impact of the NBP on emissions.  My Department will be looking at this in more detail, in due course, when assessing the benefits that are being delivered on foot of the ramping up of investment including any acceleration of the plan.</p></reply>

The scheme is a collaboration between my Department and the Department of Health and is jointly administered by the Health Service Executive and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Since 2016 over 1,300 homes have received free upgrades to their homes, including attic and wall insulation, window and door replacement and heating system upgrades where needed. </p>  <p>  The Exchequer investment in this scheme has significantly improved the warmth and comfort of the homes involved. Initial reports have indicated that the upgrades are also delivering benefits to the health and wellbeing of participants, including reports of needing fewer GP and hospital visits, fewer prescriptions for antibiotics as well as increased engagement with other support services in the community. An independent analysis is being carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), in collaboration with the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  The research element of the scheme has unfortunately experienced significant delays due to complications associated with GDPR, Brexit and more recently the COVID-19 emergency. However, every effort is being made to progress the research as quickly as possible and I intend to publish the results before the end of this year. The findings will inform Government&rsquo;s approaches to retrofitting, especially with regard to those who are more vulnerable and at risk of energy poverty</p></reply>

Under the Climate Action Plan, a Micro-Generation working group, chaired by my Department, is developing an enabling framework for micro-generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments.</p><p>My Department outlined proposals for a new Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) in a public consultation that closed on 18 February last. A summary report of the submissions received has been published on my Department's website. </p><p>  While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is envisaged that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers later this year, subject to regulatory arrangements, and in line with transposition of Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. </p><p>  It is expected that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities will publish a draft framework in the coming weeks which will outline the details, including eligibility criteria and timescales for introduction, of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) payment for exported renewable electricity. This framework will introduce an obligation on all electricity suppliers to offer remuneration to their customers, by way of a CEG payment, for excess renewable electricity exported to the grid by eligible micro- and small-scale generators. This would give effect to the above-mentioned Articles of the Directive and allow for the commencement of export payments to micro- and small-scale generators, by their suppliers. </p></reply>

A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017 to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out.

The Scheme has resulted in Bord Na M&oacute;na reassigning employees from peat harvesting activities into rehabilitation operations, while supporting the natural environment and biodiversity of the peatlands. </p>  <p>  In addition, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is currently undertaking a programme to restore Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas, a key action of the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022. In April 2020, following a public procurement process, the Department awarded a contract to Bord Na M&oacute;na  to project manage the implementation of the latest element of the Department&rsquo;s national protected raised bog restoration programme, to provide other necessary professional services and undertake the restoration measures on behalf of his Department.</p>  <p>  Combined, these schemes will support 350 jobs - taking seasonality into account, this equates to 230 full-time equivalent roles. Of the 350 jobs, approximately 330 will be from the existing workforce. </p>  <p>  With respect specifically to the Enhanced Decommissioning, Rehabilitation and Restoration Scheme, to date across counties Galway, Meath, Kildare, Westmeath, Offaly, Roscommon, Laois and Longford, my Department has been advised by Bord na Mona that 220 jobs have been assigned. This excludes BnM employees working on rehabilitation activities under contract for the NPWS. Rehabilitation under the Enhanced Decommissioning, Rehabilitation and Restoration Scheme has commenced on 16 bogs and all operatives involved have been re-assigned from peat harvesting activities.</p>  <p>  I have asked BnM to provide the further detailed information directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

It sets out a level of ambition which will position Ireland as a frontrunner towards the attainment of EU packaging recycling targets including: </p>  <p>  - overall packaging recycling rates of 65% by 2025 and 70% by 2030 and  </p>  <p>  - material specific plastic recycling rates of 50% by 2025 and 55% by 2030.</p>  <p>  The Plan also outlines the measures Ireland is taking under the Single Use Plastics Directive (EU 2019/904) to substantially reduce the amount of single use plastic items we use and to sustainably manage the waste arising from those we do. From 3 July this year single use plastic cutlery, plates, stirrers, straws, balloon sticks and cotton bud sticks may not be placed on the Irish market. This ban also applies to single use expanded polystyrene cups and food containers and all products containing oxo-degradable plastic. In addition, I will shortly be establishing the regulatory framework for a deposit and refund scheme that will become operational in Ireland next year and will ensure plastic bottles and aluminium cans are collected and managed in the most sustainable manner. </p></reply>

This will have a financial impact in that less subsidy will be paid to NBI this year; the precise amount has yet to be determined.  This will not impact the overall level of subsidy required for the NBP intervention.  </p></reply>

This decision has allowed submissions received during the consultation process to inform and contribute to the final strategy document.  </p>  <p>  Having considered the submissions made by the public, health experts, advocacy groups, academia and industry, a framework for legislation has now been developed.  From 2022 the following new standards for solid fuels will be introduced:  </p>  <p>  - Coal, coal-based products, any manufactured solid fuel or peat products will be required to have a smoke emission rate of less than 10g/hour, reducing to 5g/hr by 2025. </p>  <p>  - It is not proposed to make any changes to the smoke emission rate for biomass products (that contain coal), as this is already set at 5g/hr.  </p>  <p>  - The sulphur content permitted for all fuels will be reduced from 2% to 1% over time. </p>  <p>  - Wood sold in single units under 2m&sup3; will be required to have a moisture content of 25% or less, moving to 20% within 4 years, and wet wood sold over these volumes will be required to come with instructions for the purchaser on how to dry this wood. </p>  <p>  These regulations will be finalised in the coming months and will be in place for the 2022 heating season. I have made the announcement now to allow those servicing the domestic solid fuel market to plan accordingly, and to continue to invest in less polluting alternatives.</p>  <p>  This measure will be a central element of the Clean Air Strategy which will also identify and promote the integrated actions across Government required to reduce air pollution. I intend to open a public consultation on the Strategy in the near future.</p></reply>

This is to ensure that the most up-to-date assessment of the applicant is provided. </p>  <p>I am aware that some people seeking to renew their licences may have obtained medical reports that are no longer required, owing to the extension of their licences. However, for all classes of licence where a medical report is required, it is the applicant's responsibility to provide this and there is no mechanism to reimburse individual applicants.  </p></reply>

To be licensed to drive on Irish roads, a person must meet the high standards of safety of the driving test set out in national and EU legislation. </p>  <p>  A person with a non-EU driving licence can exchange their licence for an Irish licence if there is an exchange agreement in place with that country. Otherwise, they will have to go through the normal process of obtaining an Irish licence. An Irish licence can only be issued to a person resident in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Reaching a driving licence exchange agreement with another country is a comprehensive process carried out between the statutory licensing agencies in each state. To ensure the safety of road users, such agreements can be made only when the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the two licensing regimes and are satisfied that they are comparable. If standards and procedures are not comparable, the process does not continue.</p>  <p>  For Ireland, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority. The exchange agreement process generally takes over a year of ongoing engagement, from initiation to completion, to provide the thoroughness required to ensure the safety of Irish road users.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently considering licence exchange agreements with several non-EU licensing authorities. However, licence exchange agreements with non-EU countries will not provide a short-term solution in Ireland to the worldwide shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers and pursuit of such arrangements without proper examination of standards of training and testing would represent a significant potential risk to other road users.  </p></reply>

In this regard, there has been significant bilateral engagement between my Department and the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, in consultation with the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) and the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, to examine potential sustainable transport projects that fit the PEACE PLUS criteria.</p><p>Once funding arrangements are finalised, the draft PEACE PLUS co-operation programme will be brought to Government and to the Northern Ireland Executive for consideration and approval, before submission to the European Commission for its consideration. It is anticipated that the first funding awards under PEACE PLUS will be made during 2022.</p><p>The INTERREG VA Programme, a predecessor of the PeacePlus Programme, is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB).  The eligible area for funding includes Northern Ireland, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, and Western Scotland.  </p><p>Match-funding is provided by both the Department of Transport in Ireland and the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland to the SEUPB for three Transport-related projects under the INTERREG VA Programme. Up to 95% of Department funding is reimbursed from EU Commission via SEUPB.</p><p>The three projects funded are:</p><p>- The North West Multi-Modal Mobility Hub in Derry - This project was awarded approximately &euro;23.5 million to develop a cross-border multi-modal hub which facilitates a shift to public transport by providing modern, integrated services such as park and ride, public cycle schemes and car share. Works were completed at the Hub in 2020 and it is fully operational;</p><p>- Development of a cross-border Greenway and cycle network - work is ongoing on the construction of the three Greenways under this project, namely:</p><p>- The Carlingford Lough Greenway, awarded almost &euro;3.5m for the creation of over 10km of cross-border Greenway linking Newry to Carlingford;</p><p>- The North West Greenway Network, awarded &euro;14.8m for the creation of 46.5km of cross-border Greenway; and</p><p>- The Ulster Canal Greenway which was awarded just under &euro;5m for the creation of 22km of Greenway between Monaghan and Armagh;</p><p>- The FASTER EV Charger Project &ndash; officially launched on 9<sup>th</sup>September 2021, this project will see the installation of over 70 electric vehicle chargers in the Irish border counties, in Northern Ireland and in Western Scotland.

Funding under CEF is delivered in the form of grants allocated following competitive calls for proposals. Funding rates vary depending on the call for proposals and the type of project, generally ranging from 20% to 50% of eligible costs.</p><p>The budget available for transport projects over this period is expected to be &euro;11.3 billion, as agreed as part of the EU&rsquo;s Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) at European Council last July 2021. Additional funds are available to cohesion Member States which does not include Ireland.</p><p>Negotiations on a work programme for CEF for the 2021 &ndash; 2023 period are complete. The work programme, published 5 August 2021,  sets out the indicative budgets and types of eligible projects that can apply for co-funding grants. The aim of publishing a 3-year work programme at this stage is to enhance predictability and transparency for stakeholders, enabling higher quality proposals to be submitted to the EU. </p><p>My Department consulted extensively with stakeholders throughout the negotiation process to ensure the work programme is aligned as closely as possible to Ireland&rsquo;s needs and advocated for our position at CEF Committee, directly with other Member States, and on a bilateral basis with the European Commission.</p><p>Details of the drawdown of EU funding provided under the previous CEF programme to 2020 is not readily available by year. Further details on these projects, including all Irish CEF transport projects, are available on the website of the EU's Innovation and Networks Executive Agency at the following link:</p><p><i>ec.europa.eu/inea/sites/inea/files/cefpub/eu_investment_in_transport_in_ireland.pdf</i>.</p><p>The results of a call in 2020 for funding proposals under the previous CEF programme were announced in July 2021. There were two applications from Ireland. One of these, Shannon-Foynes Port Company, was successful and was awarded over &euro;2.3million in co-funding  relating to a feasibility study which will provide the basis for a new deep water berth off of Foynes Island, which can accommodate larger vessels and meet project demand in the coming years.</p><p>The first call under the new CEF work programme will be launched this month and further applications from Ireland are expected at that stage. Finally, my Department continues to examine all funding opportunities and mechanisms to support the transport sector in Ireland.</p></reply>

The knock-on implications for our airports have also been severe.</p>  <p>  Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the aviation sector. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme. My Department has estimated that, by the end of June this year, our airlines and airports would have received at least &euro;300 million through several of these supports.</p>  <p>  Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises, with Aer Lingus having received a &euro;150 million debt facility and daa having received a &euro;40 million participation in their bond issuance. </p>  <p>  In November 2020, Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically for Irish aviation for 2021. &euro;21 million is being provided under the Regional Airports Programme (2021-2025). This gives funding certainty to Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport Knock and supports domestic PSO routes. &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme. &euro;26 million is being provided, through a European Commission approved Irish State Aid scheme, to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. The scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and recover from the impact of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  On 1 June 2021, Government launched its Economic Recovery Plan 2021, with the goal of achieving rapid job creation and economic growth after the pandemic. This plan sets out new measures for businesses and affected sectors as the economy reopens, and details for existing emergency pandemic financial supports including the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), giving certainty to employers, workers, and for those who need it most. Importantly, this plan also recognised that additional support may be required for the recovery of the aviation sector.</p></reply>

The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the Free Travel Scheme.   In Budget 2020, and prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, a total of &euro;304 million was provided for PSO and Local Link rural regular services.  Due to the impact of Covid-19, which resulted in the collapse of fare revenue on public transport, a further &euro;370 million was allocated to enable the continued operation of public transport services in 2020.   My primary focus is to ensure that public transport services continue to operate during this pandemic and I secured almost &euro;659m for PSO services in 2021, of which &euro;30m is to support the licensed bus sector.   </p>  <p>  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  I understand that the NTA has no plans to pilot a free public transport scheme.</p></reply>

The declaration can be made for any number of calendar months between 3 and 12 months i.e. it cannot be made for a period of 1 or 2 months.  However, if a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be broken at any time simply by taxing the vehicle, either online or through a motor tax office.</p>  <p>  Where a declaration is not made in advance, motor tax must be paid for a minimum of 3 months, along with any arrears of motor tax, where applicable.</p>  <p>  Motor tax legislation does not provide for exemptions in individual cases. You will appreciate the difficulties in providing for exemptions in particular cases, given that other people have had to pay arrears in motor tax where the Declaration of Non-Use of a Motor Vehicle was not made on time, and the necessity generally of maintaining a consistent approach in the application of the legislation.</p></reply>

The information in these Guidelines is intended to assist doctors and other healthcare professionals in advising their patients on fitness to drive, requirements for reporting to the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) and guidance on review of stability, progression or improvement in these conditions. Chapter 2 of the Guidelines specifically details the roles and responsibilities of drivers, health professionals and the NDLS.</p></reply>

The decision impacts four routes - the X1 Dublin/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020), the X12 Dublin/Limerick service (which ceased operations on 30/01/2021), the 20/X20 Dublin/Galway service (which ceased operations on the 28/07/2021) and the X8 Dublin/Cork service which is also due to cease operating.   </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement PSO service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfigured to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services. In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X20 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X20 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route.</p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the Authority for reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

It is a long-standing Government policy to recommend and promote the wearing of helmets. The Rules of the Road booklet encourages the use of cycle helmets and draws attention to their safety benefits, and the Road Safety Authority, the agency responsible for public education and awareness, strongly encourages their use.</p>  <p>  However, opinion is divided internationally on whether the wearing of safety helmets is best achieved through the introduction of statutory requirements or through other strategies.  Making the wearing of helmets compulsory would raise a number of difficulties.  For example, if wearing helmets were made compulsory it would be necessary to have some kind of enforcement system with penalties, presumably fines, for cycling without a helmet.  Whilst enforcement might be possible, it could create considerable strain on Garda resources, and indeed on the courts.</p>  <p>  International studies also show that making the wearing of helmets mandatory results in a decrease in the number of people cycling.</p></reply>

While these travel plans are primarily focused on 'soft' measures such as promotion, marketing and events, they can also include some 'hard' measures such as cycle parking, cycle lanes, showers or lockers. The NTA plans to build on the current Programme by expanding the number of businesses and organisations engaged in the Programme in order to encourage as many employees as possible to consider sustainable transport modes such as cycling in their commute to and from work.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the Cycle to Work Scheme, which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, also assists employees with purchasing a bicycle to commute to work. Given its role in promoting Active Travel, I very much welcomed the announcement of increased thresholds under the Scheme as part of the July 2020 Stimulus package. The increases are in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The issue of facilitating Active Travel both for employees and across the general public will also be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s review of Sustainable Mobility Policy which is currently ongoing.  I intend that the new policy framework will provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme, including Active Travel, and I look forward to the completion of this important work in 2021.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable.</p>  <p>  There were major cutbacks in funding for the road network in general during the post 2008 recession. As a result there is a backlog of road repair works in all local authority jurisdictions across the country. The National Development Plan (NDP), as it stands, provides for a gradual increase in funding for regional and local roads and there has been a significant increase in Exchequer funding particularly in the last four years.  In this context, Wexford County Council received a total allocation of &euro;18,569,130 for 2021 which is an increase of 59% when compared to 2017. In addition, in June this year I announced the details of a &euro;17.3 million investment package for climate adaptation works on regional and local roads with a view to making the network more resilient. Wexford County Council received an allocation of &euro;650,830 under the Climate Adaptation and Resilience Works programme.</p>  <p>  Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects. Within the budget available to the Department, funding is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible to eligible local authorities. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority's area of responsibility with some account taken of traffic.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that exchequer funding for regional and local roads is intended to supplement realistic contributions from local authorities&rsquo; own resources. As the statutory road authorities for their areas, it is open to local authorities to reprioritise investment towards regional and local roads.</p></reply>

Micro-mobility options like e-scooters have an important role to play in this transition to a cleaner and greener society and economy. The Deputy will be aware that the forthcoming Road Traffic Bill includes provisions to allow for the development of e-scooter regulations accordingly. </p>  <p>  The Bill will define a new category of vehicle in the Road Traffic Act 1961 called &ldquo;powered personal transporters&rdquo; or &lsquo;PPTs&rsquo;, which will include e-scooters, and amend the current definition for mechanically propelled vehicles (MPVs) to remove PPTs from its scope. Establishing this new category will enable us to subsequently set out appropriate technical and safety standards and rules for the use of e-scooters in secondary legislation, without the same need for registration, licencing and taxation associated with MPVs. </p>  <p>  The preparatory work to draft these technical Regulations has already commenced. Earlier this year, my Department undertook a comprehensive consultation process with key stakeholders to inform the development of these Regulations, including the Road Safety Authority, the National Transport Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Local Government and representation from a range of industry, advocacy and accessibility groups. My Department will consider these submissions, in tandem with the learnings from the introduction of e-scooters in other jurisdictions, to ensure that we can foster a supportive environment for micro-mobility vehicles while tackling the implementation challenges associated with innovative modes of travel. It should be noted that maintaining the highest standards of road safety, particularly for the most vulnerable road users, will continue to be a priority for my Department.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the Bill will shortly be introduced in the D&aacute;il with a view to finalisation and commencement before the end of this year.</p></reply>

The intent of this programme is to renew and replace life-expired lifts and lifts in poor condition, to ensure the reliability and availability of lift access. </p>  <p>  In 2020 the National Transport Authority (NTA) established a rail lift refurbishment/replacement programme, under the Capital Programme, with a &euro;3.3m ring fenced allocation. A major part of the programme in 2020 was the upgrading of lifts at 12 stations in the Dublin Suburban area. For 2021, &euro;3.84m was originally ring-fenced by the NTA from the Capital Programme to the Lift and Escalator Renewal Programme. An additional &euro;2m was allocated to the Programme in November 2020, as part of Budget 2021, bringing the total allocated to the Lifts and Escalator Renewal Programme to &euro;5.84m this year. The additional allocation will enable the acceleration of the delivery of the 5-year programme.</p>  <p>  I have also referred the Deputy's question to Irish Rail for direct reply in relation to the specific stations mentioned.

Since May 2021, the RSA has been returning to delivering tests for all customers, while continuing to prioritise critical frontline workers. This means, in the interest of fairness, the RSA targeted test appointments to those waiting longest who are ready and eligible to take the test. The number of tests being offered weekly</p>  <p>  continues to grow </p>  <p>   The service continues to operate under restrictions in the interest of making it safe while there is an ongoing presence of Covid. Given the necessity for a tester to be in close proximity to a test candidate, and to get into vehicles brought by the candidates which are therefore not a controlled environment, this places limits on the capacity of the test service. </p>  <p>  When the service resumed in June 2020, testers were conducting 5 tests each per day, as against 8 before the pandemic. This increased to 6 tests from 14 September 2020. The RSA is looking to increase the number of tests to 7 per tester per day from late September 2021, subject to compliance with health protocols. </p>  <p>  In order to deal with the backlog, the RSA received sanction to hire 40 new temporary testers, in addition to 36 they were sanctioned to retain or rehire in 2020. These new testers have completed their training and are now conducting live tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40 testers and the process has commenced. </p>  <p>   An extra 10 temporary test centres have been opened (and are effectively an expansion of existing locations or replacing unsuitable locations), and a further 9 locations have been expanded within the existing premises, to accommodate more testers. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to be guided by public health advice on the safe provision of services and, in conjunction with the RSA, continues to keep the situation under review to ensure that every possible measure is being put in place so that the maximum number of customers can be served, while adhering to public health requirements. </p></reply>

Support in the form of government funding is being refocused to prioritise battery electric cars. Grants for these EVs continue at a rate of &euro;5000. From the 1st of July 2021, the value of the purchase grant for PHEVs changed from &euro;5,000 to &euro;2,500. It is likely that the signalling of this change contributed to an increase in PHEV applications in the first half of this year which is reflected in the above table.</p><p>The SEAI grant scheme aims to encourage behavioural change and support the Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieving a 51% reduction in transport emissions by 2030. The grant schemes are kept under continuous review to ensure that they are as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. The update to the scheme is in line with the wider policy approach being taken by other EU Member States due to the increasing recognition that PHEV emissions in the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; are often higher than &lsquo;official&rsquo; emission levels.</p></reply>

If mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should contact their lender directly.  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit, and/or the conditions which may attach to a mortgage offer, is ultimately a business and commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity and I cannot become involved in such matters. </p></reply>

Risks in relation to crypto assets are included in Revenue&rsquo;s compliance framework. This analytical approach to taxpayer behaviour and risk is continuously evolving and being enhanced in line with current developments. </p>  <p>  Ireland operates a self-assessment tax system. The receipt of crypto assets as a form of payment for services or goods rendered will give rise to Income Tax for individuals or Corporation Tax for corporate taxpayers. Value Added Tax (VAT) on the Euro equivalent value of the crypto asset when received should also be considered, if applicable, to the receipt of these assets as a form of payment. The disposal of crypto assets is treated in the same manner as the disposal of all assets for Capital Gains Tax purposes. There are no special rules in Ireland for the tax treatment of crypto assets.   </p>  <p>  Under the Taxes Consolidation Act, Revenue have the power to obtain information on crypto asset or cryptocurrency transactions, as is the case for other transactions, where there is reason to believe the transaction is relevant to tax. These powers include obtaining information from the taxpayer, from a financial institution or from any other third party who holds relevant information.</p>  <p>  The European Commission is expected to publish a proposal on exchange of information in respect to crypto-assets before the end of 2021. This will be the eighth iteration of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) and will be referred to as &ldquo;DAC8&rdquo;. We understand that the purpose of DAC8 will be to ensure that EU tax transparency rules keep pace with the evolving economy including in respect to crypto assets and e-money. </p>  <p>  The OECD is also anticipated to release a recommended policy framework for crypto-assets reporting standards in the upcoming months. This framework will further strengthen the cohesive approach under the Common Reporting Standards (&ldquo;CRS&rdquo;) which calls on jurisdictions to obtain, on an annual basis, information from financial institutions and exchange that information with other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  Ireland actively contributes to the ongoing work at both EU and OECD levels to develop tax reporting frameworks that will provide information to tax authorities on transactions involving crypto-assets and e-money and has also been engaged in work to better understand how such transactions are treated for tax purposes in different jurisdictions.</p></reply>

My Department is aware of the increase in the target to 6% and is committed to achieving this revised target by 2024. The following table sets out the percentage of employees with a disability for the years 2015 to 2020. The 2020 figure was taken from a census survey conducted in March 2021 and is deemed the current percentage figure for my Department.  <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year</b></th>       <th>2015</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Percentage</b></td>       <td>4.9%</td>       <td>3.0%</td>       <td>4.1%</td>       <td>4.1%</td>       <td>5.14%</td>       <td>4.38%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>All recruitment into my Department from outside the Civil Service is conducted through the Public Appointments Service (PAS). As such, my Department does not directly determine the level of access to employment for persons with disabilities. Where my Department recruits internally or through the Civil Service Mobility Scheme, this is conducted in accordance with the Code of Practice published by the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA). The Code of Practice reflects the following core principles:</p><p>- Probity</p><p>- Appointments are made on merit</p><p>- An appointments process in line with best practice</p><p>- A fair appointments process applied with consistency</p><p>- Appointments are made in an open, accountable and transparent manner</p><p>Furthermore, my Department has recently rolled out Diversity 3.0 Workshops to all staff and has aimed to ensure all staff have undertaken this programme. During 2016 and 2017, a major refurbishment project was undertaken by the Office of Public Works in my Department in Government Buildings on Merrion Street. As part of that project, electronic doors were installed to assist the movement of staff across the campus. In 2019, an external lift was installed in the main block to allow staff with mobility difficulties to access the building more easily.</p><p>My Department adheres to its requirements as set out by the Disability Act of 2005. It has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) who works closely with the National Disability Authority (NDA) to ensure that the Department is fully compliant with its obligations under the Act. Bi-monthly DLO Network meetings are held to share knowledge and assist other DLOs across the Civil Service, as well as engaging with staff in accessing training and learning events. My Department has also held awareness presentations in the areas of Autism and Dyslexia in the Workplace and has marked International Day of People with Disabilities and it is proposed to continue to do so.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s website, intranet and Build to Share programmes all have software to aid the visually impaired. A &lsquo;loop system&rsquo; is in place in my Department&rsquo;s main conference room for staff and visitors with hearing loss.</p><p>The position in relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department with direct employees is set out below.</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland is committed to attracting and retaining people with disabilities and has various actions in place to support this. It gathers data on disability in the workplace via an annual employee survey; 2.7% of respondents to end-2020 disclosed that they had a disability. This equates to 1.45% of the total workforce at that time. The Central Bank is considering ways in which it can increase disclosure rates to build a more accurate profile. In addition, the Bank is currently considering, via a cross-functional Disability Taskforce, what further actions are needed to increase the number of employees with disabilities taking into account the legislative target of 3% and the 6% target outlined in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. The Bank has participated in recent years in work experience programmes designed specifically for people with disabilities including the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) work placement programme run by the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) and placements via the National Council for the Blind of Ireland. Working with WAM, the Central Bank ring-fences roles, typically two, in its annual Graduate Programme for graduates with disabilities. The Bank also attends AHEAD&rsquo;s Annual Careers Fair. Across all of its recruitment campaigns, the Central Bank highlights that it welcomes diverse candidates and is an equal opportunities employer. It provides reasonable accommodations throughout every stage of the recruitment process. The Bank aims to provide an accessible physical environment which supports the attraction and retention of people with disabilities. Its headquarters in North Wall Quay has won national and international awards for its universal design and accessibility. Over one hundred specific recommendations were integrated into the design, from large &ldquo;smart&rdquo; lifts with good signage, clear controls, light floor finishes, and contrasting handrails to half-height mirrors. A variety of supports are provided to colleagues with disabilities as required, including ergonomic and accessibility assessments, personal emergency evacuation planning, &lsquo;buddy&rsquo; training, assistive technologies such as voice activated software and other equipment or awareness training. The Central Bank has an Access Officer to provide a central point of contact for staff and the public, as well as to promote awareness across all activities and services. It has an active employee led network (Bankability Network), the aim of which is to ensure a strong and supportive network for colleagues impacted by disability and to raise awareness among all staff. Amongst other activities, the network hosts regular events which are open to all staff to attend with inspiring speakers on various topics relating to disability in the workplace. Disability awareness training is also provided to frontline staff and to those providing services to the public. The Central Bank provides staffing to the Investor Compensation Company DAC which is also a body under my Department&rsquo;s remit.</p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) fully recognises its obligations and responsibilities with regard to the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 and Disability Act 2005, and is committed to enabling access to employment for persons with disabilities. The FSPO operates its recruitment campaigns in compliance with the Codes of Practice for Appointment to Positions in the Civil Service and Public Service and is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for prospective candidates. It encourages applications under all nine grounds of the Employment Equality Acts and offers reasonable accommodation to current and prospective employees with disabilities, in accordance with the Acts. A staff census undertaken in 2020 indicated that, at 8.23%, the FSPO exceeded the minimum requirement set out in the Disability Act 2005 in relation to the level of employment of people with disabilities, which demonstrates that its recruitment policies have been effective in reaching the targets set out in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for Persons with Disabilities. The FSPO continues to enhance practices in this area and has emphasised the requirement to achieve an inclusive and diverse workplace over the course of the next strategic period.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), is aware of and engaged in achieving the targets to increase employment of persons with a disability. The NTMA is exceeding the target of 3% with a current disability workforce of 4.28%. The NTMA is working towards the target of 6% by 2024 by engaging with specialist recruiters and attending specialist recruitment fairs. The Disability Awareness Team works with business units to recruit roles for persons with a disability. The NTMA partners with organisations in order to expand and advance its objectives and continues engagement with Down Syndrome Ireland, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, AHEAD, Trinity College, and Specialisterne Ireland. Under the terms of a Service Level Agreement, the NTMA provides staffing services to Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, all of which are also bodies under the aegis of my Department.</p><p>The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General takes all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of persons with disabilities. The Disability Act 2005 requires public service employers to report each year on the number and percentage of employees with disabilities according to the legal definition of a disability. Each employee fills out this form as part of their induction process in the Office. All employees are given access to this form on the Office intranet and may also submit this at any time during employment should a disability develop or come to light. There is a DLO in place to support staff with disabilities employed by the Office. Currently just under 8% of staff of the Office have self-declared a disability. The Office has a range of items available to assist staff with a disability, including sit-stand desks and scanner pens which read text aloud once scanned over an electronic document. Hearing aids are also available and can be linked to staff telephone extension numbers. Other items such as larger monitors for the visually impaired or specialised chairs for back conditions are purchased by the Office on a case by case basis. The Office is also fully wheelchair accessible. The Office also ensures that all vacancies are advertised on its website; the website is enabled with software, Recite me, which reads the site, translates and/or increases the size of text to provide information to visually or audibly impaired persons who may wish to apply for vacancies.</p><p>I am advised by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners that there is a strong culture of acceptance and equality among Revenue staff and towards taxpayers, ensuring that human rights and diversity are embraced and accepted. As an Equal Opportunities employer, Revenue operates in compliance with the relevant legislative framework to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities at work, including the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Equal Status Acts 2000, the Employment Equality Act 2004 and the Disability Act 2005. Revenue has two DLOs, who provide information to support new entrants and serving employees with disabilities, as well as those requiring workplace accommodations which may include the provision of assistive technology and certain office equipment. Most Revenue offices countrywide are adapted for use by staff with physical disabilities. In compliance with its reporting obligations under Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, Revenue provides information on its employment of people with disabilities to the NDA annually. In 2020, the proportion of Revenue employees with a declared disability was 4.1%. Revenue staff are trained in Equality and Diversity as part of their induction training. In 2019, Revenue established a Partnership Intensive Group to review and update its Equality and Diversity Strategy and Public Sector Duty Action Plan. In 2020, the group drafted an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) policy document and associated Action Plan. This work is being further developed in 2021, in the context of Revenue&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy and Workforce Plan for the period 2021-2026. The policy provides a future EDI framework, ensuring that Revenue is following best practice, promoting a culture of dignity and respect for all employees, and eliminating all forms of discrimination. Revenue&rsquo;s recruitment competitions are subject to the Code of Practice of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, which has a statutory role to ensure that appointments in the organisations subject to its remit are made on merit and as the result of fair and transparent appointment processes. Revenue actively participates in Disability Programmes such as the WAM Initiative, which serves to widen access to employment for those with disabilities and create attitudinal change and opportunities for further employment and is committed to continue taking all reasonable measures to promote and support the recruitment and employment of people with disabilities and enrich the culture of inclusivity and diversity in its workforce.</p><p>The Tax Appeals Commission conducts all its recruitment campaigns through the PAS and any request for staff does not differentiate between persons from minority or disadvantaged communities or anyone who may have a disability. As of August 2021, the percentage of staff employed by the Commission with a disability is just under 6%.</p><p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is committed to supporting and promoting the employment of people with disabilities and is an equal opportunities employer. Currently, none of the Fiscal Council&rsquo;s staff members have declared a disability. </p></reply>

Subject to a maximum repayment amount, HTB takes the form of a repayment of income tax, including DIRT, paid for the four tax years prior to making an application.  A first-time buyer is given the option of selecting all or any of the previous four tax years prior to making an application for HTB.</p><p>Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.  Revenue&rsquo;s Tax and Duty manual Part 15-01-46 Help to Buy Scheme outlines further guidance and is available on its website at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-46.pdf.</p><p>In August 2020, the Government introduced an enhancement to the HTB scheme as part of the July Stimulus plan, which was later extended in Finance Act 2020.

Revenue allows an employer to make compensatory payments of up to &euro;3.20 per day to remote workers, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-Worker, or indeed where an employee incurs costs in excess of the &euro;3.20 per day paid by the employer, the employees concerned retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses they have incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim any such additional costs in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.</p><p>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the position is that the HTB scheme is mutually exclusive from other claims for refunds of tax paid by an individual.  By way of example, where an individual paid tax of &euro;25,000 in 2019 and claimed &euro;20,000 in that year for HTB, some or all of the balance of tax of &euro;5,000 remaining could be refunded to the person, if he/she had additional tax credits or reliefs to claim that year in respect of expenditure on items such as working from home expenses or health expenses.  Of course, if a person has had all their tax deducted for a year refunded to them under the HTB scheme, he/she would not be entitled to any further tax refunds for that year.</p><p>In the scenario mentioned by the Deputy, for an individual who availed of the HTB scheme to purchase his or her home in 2020, he or she is not precluded from claiming a deduction in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred in working from home in 2020 or 2021 (or for that matter, from an employer paying that individual &euro;3.20 per day).  The HTB legislation prescribes that an individual must select a relevant tax year, which means a year of assessment within the four tax years immediately preceding the year in which the application was made.  Thus, for a house purchased in 2020, the relevant tax years are 2016, 2017, 2018 or 2019. </p><p>A PAYE worker who incurs relevant expenditure can claim e-Working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end. Revenue advises that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-Working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.  </p><p>Revenue has published detailed guidance on this subject and on the question of how claims for e-Working expenses should be calculated and submitted in the Tax and Duty manual &lsquo;e-Working and Tax&rsquo;, which is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-13.pdf.</p><p>Finally, the national remote working strategy &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo;, commits the Tax Strategy Group to reviewing the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers.  The Tax Strategy Group will take account of the economic, financial and organisational implications arising from the experience of remote working during the pandemic and assess the merits of further enhancement for consideration in the context of Budget 2022.  </p></reply>

In the case of non-resident investors, their liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  The broad rationale for exempting such funds from direct taxation is to facilitate individuals to invest collectively, without suffering double taxation (that is, taxation both within the fund and in the hands of the investor on distribution).  Most OECD countries now have a tax system that provides for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a Collective Investment Vehicle/Fund. </p>  <p>  There is a charge to tax on Irish residents on the happening of a &ldquo;chargeable event&rdquo;. In order to prevent the indefinite deferral of a chargeable event (and therefore an exit charge), a deemed disposal occurs 8 years following inception of a policy of life assurance or acquisition of a fund and then every 8 years thereafter.  The deemed disposal rules also apply to equivalent offshore funds.  Any gain on the investment which arises from the date of inception or the date of acquisition to the date of the deemed disposal is subject to tax. This ensures that income isn&rsquo;t rolled up indefinitely in life assurance policies or funds without being taxed. On the ultimate disposal of the investment, any tax paid which arose as a result of a deemed disposal is allowed as a credit against any final tax liability on disposal.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to review the 8 year deemed disposal rule at this time.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p>  <p>  Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  A relevant business activity which is seasonal in nature is not restricted from qualifying under CRSS where they are subject to Covid restrictions and as a result, are prohibited or significantly restricted from allowing customers access their business premises, and they meet all other qualifying criteria. </p>  <p>  Where a business is no longer subject to COVID restrictions which require them to prohibit or restrict customers from accessing their business premises, that business will not be eligible for CRSS for the periods where they choose not to open because of the seasonal nature of the business.</p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.  </p>  <p>  As non-essential retail businesses were permitted to open from 17 May 2021, they are no longer subject to Covid restrictions which would require them to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Therefore, from that date, they ceased to qualify for support under the CRSS. However, subject to meeting the relevant criteria, a business reopening after a period of restrictions, may claim a &ldquo;restart week payment&rdquo; under the CRSS scheme to assist it with the costs of reopening. </p>  <p>  For businesses reopening between 29 April 2021 and 1 June 2021, an &ldquo;enhanced restart week payment&rdquo; may be claimed, which is computed at double the normal weekly CRSS rate, for two weeks, subject to a maximum weekly amount payable of &euro;5,000.</p>  <p>  Businesses who qualified for CRSS and who, from 2 June 2021, become eligible to claim a &ldquo;restart week&rdquo; payment, can submit a single claim for a &ldquo;restart week&rdquo; payment, that will cover a period of three weeks at double the normal rate, to assist them with the additional costs of reopening. he amount that may be claimed in respect of each &ldquo;restart week&rdquo; is subject to a maximum weekly amount payable under the scheme which has been increased to &euro;10,000 per week specifically in relation to the triple restart week payments.</p>  <p>  On 1 June, I announced that an additional business support scheme, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), would be available for businesses whose turnover in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is reduced by 75% compared with their 2019 turnover.  To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D.  The BRSS is now open for applications via the Revenue Commissioners website.  Under the scheme, a qualifying business will be able to claim a cash payment calculated as three times the sum of 10% of their average weekly turnover up to &euro;20,000 and 5% on any excess of average weekly turnover above &euro;20,000, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed individuals may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme has been extended to the end of 2021 and it is expected that CRSS will be continued to the end of 2021 for those businesses that are still directly affected by public health restrictions that may remain in place. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

Revenue works very closely with businesses and tax practitioners and continues to be flexible and responsive in putting solutions and processes in place that assist and support businesses.

Where access to necessary information for tax returns is being impacted by COVID-related difficulties, the relevant return should be submitted on a &lsquo;best estimate&rsquo; basis. Revenue has advised me that it would expect that the instance of such difficulties is expected to be very low and Revenue has assured me that any subsequent amendments can be completed on a self-correction basis without incurring additional penalties.</p>  <p>  Revenue will continue to monitor the situation over the coming months, but no further extension on filing deadlines is envisaged at this time.

However, lenders should make the duration of any Approval in Principle clear to a consumer, in line with the requirement of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 to provide clear information to a consumer and to bring key information to the attention of the consumer.  When a lender offers a mortgage to a consumer, the Code requires that the lender must include the length of time for which the mortgage offer is valid in the offer document. However, it remains a business matter for individual lenders to set the duration period of a mortgage approval (and if necessary to decide whether or not to extend the period of mortgage approval) and it would not be appropriate for me to become involved in the commercial and business making decisions of lenders.  Ultimately of course there is also an obligation on lenders to provide mortgage credit to consumers only where the results of a creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement and lenders will need to satisfy themselves that they can comply with this obligation.       </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit or the drawn down of credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, the mortgage applicant should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

As a consequence of this decision all staff were already equipped to work remotely from 16 March 2020 when Public Health restrictions were introduced. Approximately eight weeks after the introduction of these restrictions the Central Bank began a process of providing additional equipment such as a monitor, office chair, laptop stand, keyboard and mouse, to improve the ergonomic experience of remote working staff at a cost of &euro;353,259. The Bank does not pay any contribution towards home telephony or Wi-Fi costs. The Bank is currently undertaking an impact assessment of potential future ways of working which will result in the introduction of an optional hybrid working model for the majority of staff. Temporary transitional working arrangements in line with current public health guidelines are in operation pending completion of this assessment.</p><p>The Credit Review Office (CRO) currently has 3 staff: 1 Credit Reviewer employed by my Department and 2 seconded from Enterprise Ireland. The CRO has incurred no additional costs in relation to remote working, and has received no applications for remote working to date.</p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) has taken measures to facilitate remote working since March 2020, in order to comply with public health measures in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic while ensuring it continues to fulfil its statutory role and meets the needs of its customers. The costs associated with the facilitation of remote working are as follows: &euro;105,892 on IT equipment and &euro;1,887 on telephony. The FSPO has not contributed to individual staff Wi-Fi or phone-related expenses. The costs detailed above relate to the provision of FSPO equipment to facilitate staff to work remotely. The FSPO has undertaken staff engagement surveys on remote working to assist in determining the future working arrangements of the FSPO in accordance with public health guidelines. The FSPO is examining the potential to pilot a blended working arrangement for team members, where appropriate, recognising that the primary focus of any future working arrangements will be delivery against the FSPO&rsquo;s statutory role and ensuring the delivery of an efficient, accessible service for all its customers, while taking account the needs of staff and ensuring that Government policy in this area is implemented. </p><p>All staff of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have been working remotely since March 2020 and continue to do so. The Council has invested approximately &euro;7,500 in respect of the provision of laptops and equipment to facilitate remote working. The Council has a remote working policy in place with a hybrid-model applying on a physical return to the office.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) introduced remote working for employees in July 2019 by way of the NTMA Remote Working Guide. Since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, and in accordance with Government advice, NTMA employees have predominantly worked from home. It is the NTMA&rsquo;s expectation that employees will not have to seek permission for hybrid working rather that a hybrid working model will be available to all employees. The costs incurred to date in terms of the provision of Laptops and ICT related peripherals to promote or facilitate remote work for staff are as follows: &euro;207,260 on ICT equipment and &euro;3,191 on reimbursement of employee costs incurred on personal mobile accounts for the purposes of carrying out work. While the NTMA Remote Working Guide is dated July 2019, costs were primarily incurred further to the impact of Covid-19 from March 2020 onwards. Under the terms of a Service Level Agreement, the NTMA provides staffing services to Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland which are also bodies under the aegis of my Department.</p><p>Staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General are working remotely in line with current Government and HSE guidelines and will continue to do so until updated advice has been received. Due to the nature of the work of the Office, a degree of remote working was already facilitated prior to the current pandemic, a teleworking policy was in place and staff had the necessary equipment to work outside of the Office, at home or in client premises. The Office has been able to fund any additional costs associated with remote working during the pandemic from savings in other areas within the Office&rsquo;s voted allocation. A model for the future of work in the Office developed with extensive staff consultation, has recently been approved by the Audit Board. The model will facilitate a hybrid working arrangement enabling staff to divide their time between remote and in-office work while ensuring that the business objectives are achieved. The model will form the basis of a blended working policy for the Office to be developed once the central policy framework has been agreed.</p><p>Most staff at the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have been working remotely since March 2020. Generally in excess of 75% of Revenue&rsquo;s staff are remote working each week. Revenue staff are currently continuing to work in line with Government Covid-19 guidance, which provides for home working to continue where possible. Revenue is an active participant on the interdepartmental working group that is developing General Principles to inform a longer term remote working framework for the Civil Service. It is expected that the central policy framework for Blended Working in the Civil Service will be finalised in conjunction with employee representatives over the coming months. This framework will inform the development of Revenue&rsquo;s future blended working policy. The primary objective of the longer-term framework will be towards ensuring that Revenue&rsquo;s business requirements are fully supported and will also be in accordance with the objectives of the &ldquo;Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future&rdquo; in relation to the availability of remote working for staff in the Public Sector. Revenue is also actively participating with other Government Departments in the design of the application process that will be used to administer staff requests to work from home once the current Covid-19 restrictions are lifted. In a survey of Revenue staff carried out in May 2021, 67% of respondents indicated that they favoured blended working for the future. Revenue&rsquo;s key expenditure figures for equipment to enable homeworking since March 2020 are &euro;565,000 on laptops, &euro;92,000 on headsets, &euro;39,000 on network equipment, and &euro;447,200 on mobile phones.</p><p>The Tax Appeals Commission has drafted a remote working policy for its staff members but is awaiting final guidelines and direction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before implementation can take place. The new remote working policy is expected to be offered to all staff members. The Commission spent &euro;27,847 procuring laptops for the majority of staff to enable employees to work from home. This expenditure was also necessary for the Commission to move to a &ldquo;Build To Share Desktop Service&rdquo; in August 2020 provided by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. This support now underpins the ICT infrastructure that maintains the Commission&rsquo;s business services including servers, storage, government networks, perimeter defenses, conferencing services, web content filters and anti-virus faculties. To date, no staff member has requested remote working on a permanent or hybrid-basis, however, the Commission conducted an internal anonymous survey in May 2021 which indicated a level of interest in some form of hybrid working. </p></reply>

This in turn facilitates direct payments to its disabled members to enable them manage their own support services.  I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by this organisation and its members regarding the increased cost of insurance cover and share concerns regarding such issues as cost and supply of insurance. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor do we have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals. This position is reinforced by the EU Solvency II Directive insurance framework. </p>  <p>  Having said that, since becoming aware of this issue, my officials have engaged with the industry representative body Insurance Ireland.  It has acknowledged that some insurers have withdrawn from parts of the liability insurance sector in recent years, and also noted the increase in average claims costs during this time, pointing to data from the recent report of the National Claims Information Database.  According to Insurance Ireland, increases in claims costs were due to volatility in the personal injuries claims environment. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I believe that the new Personal Injuries Guidelines should provide much greater certainty regarding award levels, in addition to reducing awards for many common injuries, and also leading to lower legal fees by encouraging greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to settle claims. This should have a stabilising impact in relation to the issues currently being experienced by these organisations.  Indeed, in meetings with the main insurance companies in the Irish market, Minister of State Fleming has stated the Government&rsquo;s expectation that insurers should now increase their risk appetite to extend cover to new market segments or areas they may have withdrawn from in recent years, in light of these savings.  I understand that he will be meeting with insurers again in the coming months to review their response to the Guidelines and other insurance reforms.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I also hope that the improved claims environment resulting from the implementation of the Guidelines will help to attract new entrants into the Irish market, or encourage providers who previously exited this market to return. Separately, I understand that the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market is working with IDA Ireland to develop a customised proposition for potential new market entrants, and to identify a shortlist of specific target companies. </p>  <p>  These and further important actions, such as reviewing the duty of care, are being prioritised under the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. The implementation of the Government's broad package of reforms should assist in the development of a more sustainable and competitive market by deepening and widening the supply of insurance here, thereby improving both the cost and availability of cover for all groups, particularly those that deliver such valuable services as the organisation in question.  </p></reply>

It is available to Irish and international film production companies that are resident in the State or in an EEA State and carry on business in the State through a branch or subsidiary. The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.</p>  <p>  Finance Act 2018 introduced a short-term, tapered regional uplift. The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs, to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector. The regional availability of the uplift is limited to areas in Ireland sanctioned to receive regional aid under the EU regional aid guidelines.</p>  <p>  When introduced in Finance Act 2018 the regional uplift was to be phased out on a tiered basis with 5% available in years 1 and 2 (2019 &amp;amp; 2020), 3% available in year 3 (2021), 2% available in year 4 (2022), and 0% available from year 5 on. However, the COVID-19 crisis had a detrimental impact on the audiovisual sector, with the majority of production companies having to suspend activity for a significant portion of 2020 and, as a result, much of the intended incentive effect of the regional uplift in 2020 was lost. Therefore Finance Bill 2020 amended the regional uplift to provide for an additional 5% year in 2021, in effect to replace the incentive year lost as a result of the Covid-related public health measures.  The tapered withdrawal of the uplift then restarts, reducing to 3% in 2022, 2% in 2023, and Nil thereafter.</p>  <p>  My officials examine a range of possible measures in advance of the Finance Act each year, including potential amendments to Section 481 Film Relief, and the Deputy's proposal will be considered as part of this process. In this regard it should be noted that film relief is an approved State aid and any amendments to the scheme would require consideration of State aid constraints and approval from the European Commission.</p></reply>

Furthermore, enquiries made by my Department with relevant bodies failed to identify the practice within the public service pensions payment system to which the Deputy refers.  However, if the Deputy wishes to provide further details, my officials will make further enquiries.</p>  <p>  That being said, in terms of Revenue compliance in relation to payroll practices, Revenue have advised as follows:</p>  <p>  The Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system is a method of tax deduction under which an employer (including occupational pension providers) calculates and deducts any income tax due each time a payment of wages, salary, pensions etc. is made to an employee (any reference to employee also includes &lsquo;occupational pension recipients&rsquo;). In addition, employers are obliged to calculate and deduct any liability to Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI), Universal Social Charge (USC) and Local Property Tax (LPT).</p>  <p>  The PAYE system operates on a receipts basis which means that income tax and other statutory deductions are to be operated when a payment is being made to an employee. Under the PAYE system, tax should be operated on any interim payments or advance payments of emoluments made by an employer to an employee. With the introduction of PAYE real time payroll reporting with effect from 1 January 2019, employers are obliged to report their employees&rsquo; pay and statutory deductions to Revenue, on or before the date they pay their staff.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that the frequency of payments to retirees is a matter for the Public Service employer in question and notwithstanding this an employer is obliged to operate PAYE correctly on all payments.</p></reply>

However the Deputy will be aware that this coincided with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which required the immediate attention of officials both in Ireland and in the Commission to develop and implement measures to support businesses and employees affected by the public health restrictions.</p><p>- Since the onset of the pandemic, this Government has introduced extensive Covid-19 supports, many of which will have provided immediate support to small businesses to maintain a level of trade and retain their staff in employment.</p><p>- The measures specific to small and micro companies therefore have not yet been commenced, but the easing of public health restrictions and the reducing need for related support measures will allow greater scope for my officials to progress matters relating to the R&amp;amp;D credit.</p><p>- In respect of PQ 43178/21, I am advised by Revenue that future levels of expenditure on research and development is not known and therefore a cost for the year 2022 of the Deputy's proposed amendment cannot be estimated. However, based on information included in tax returns for 2019 (the most recent year available), the cash flow impact in that year would have been &euro;25 million if the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal had been implemented in that year for small and micro companies.</p><p>- The Deputy may also be interested in Revenue&rsquo;s published information in respect of the research and development tax credit, which is available at: <i></i>.</p></reply>

VRT is an emissions-based tax and therefore the amount of VRT incurred will vary across different vehicle makes and models. Typically, the new rates structure will result in increases for high emission vehicles, and decreases for lower emission vehicles. Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the reliefs at this time.</p></reply>

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.</p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;4.6 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;735 million have been granted to 51,200 employers in respect of 650,100 workers.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made in June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021. For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the configuration of the EWSS in Q4 2021 in relation to its various aspects will be addressed in the coming weeks.   Also, no decisions have been taken in relation to future of the scheme beyond the end of Q4, 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

ISIF has invested &euro;66m in Genuity Science to date, alongside a range of sophisticated private investors on commercial terms which were acceptable to such investors and ISIF. Consistent with the approach it takes on all investments, ISIF conducted an appropriate due diligence exercise prior to making its investment. I understand that for reasons of commercial sensitivity ISIF does not comment on the carrying value of its investments from time to time but I note that ISIF has publicly stated that Genuity&rsquo;s valuation has been negatively impacted by the global pandemic and its exposure to geopolitical events. </p>  <p>  ISIF&rsquo;s portfolio is diversified, comprising investments in a range of asset classes across the spectrum of risk that are consistent with its mandate of achieving economic impact while earning a commercial return. High-risk investments in the life sciences and tech sectors comprise a very small percentage of the overall portfolio (less than 3%). Investments of this nature can be volatile and are often early-stage but have the ability to deliver significant return potential. ISIF has a number of direct investments that have and continue to deliver significant gains, however ISIF also expects that there will inevitably be some individual investments where it will recover less than the total invested. Notwithstanding the risks inherent in these investments, since ISIF&rsquo;s inception, overall high-risk investments have delivered positive returns of circa 18% at H1 2021. Overall, the returns on the total portfolio of &euro;9.2bn since inception exceed &euro;2.2bn, with as of H1 2021 generating returns of 5.2% year to date. The fund has generated annual returns of 4.1% pa since inception.</p></reply>

Consumers are accordingly free to choose whatever product best meets their needs, with price obviously being a relevant factor.  Insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience. This illustrates the importance of shopping around for insurance.</p>  <p>  In relation to the experience referred to with a specific insurance provider, it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am not in a position to comment on or intervene in respect of individual cases.</p>  <p>  I understand that there is no statutory basis behind the individual policies of insurance companies pertaining to the time period of non-continuous driving experience for the purposes of retaining insurance cover.  Officials in my Department have previously engaged with Insurance Ireland on this issue.  They confirmed that the general current timeframe of two years companies use in this regard is one which appears to have evolved within the insurance market itself, rather than representing a rule imposed by the industry and/or the State, and that there may be flexibility from certain individual providers if the time period concerned is marginally over two years.  Ultimately, this is a commercial matter for companies and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.   </p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, Government has consistently called on insurers to treat customers honestly, fairly and professionally, and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. With regard to insurance for Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) drivers, I understand from my officials that several insurers in the market introduced measures last year to ease the burden on drivers, including the ability to reduce vehicle cover to social, pleasure and domestic use only with pro-rata refunds provided. However, as the Deputy will be aware, I cannot direct insurers to offer such measures. It should be noted that the National Transport Authority (NTA) advises that where SPSV insurance is not in place, the driver does not hold a valid SPSV licence. I believe that it is important that anyone concerned should engage directly with their insurer or broker and the NTA regarding their circumstances and options. </p>  <p>  In situations where a person is not satisfied with the service of an insurance provider, it is advisable that that person make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process. The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes, which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p>  <p>  Finally, where an individual is having difficulty in receiving an insurance quotation, or a private company has issues in relation to named drivers on their fleet policy, which may be relevant in this case, they may wish to use the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA). Under the terms of the DCA, which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse cover if the person has approached at least three insurers and has been unable to obtain cover from them. In this regard, there are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website, while more generally, Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. The relevant contact details are: feedback@insuranceireland.eu or declined@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

It is my intention, along with Minister of State Fleming, to work to ensure that the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government are progressed in accordance with the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. As the Deputy may be aware, the Cabinet Committee Insurance Reform Sub-Group in July published the first six-monthly Implementation Report of the Action Plan. This shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now completed. The Sub-Group&rsquo;s focus now is on implementing the outstanding actions on time.</p>  <p>  In relation to motor insurance prices more generally, I would note that, according to Central Statistics Office (CSO) data for July 2021, motor insurance prices are continuing to decline. Motor insurance prices in June were 34.7% lower than their peak in July 2016; and 5.7% lower than when the Government&rsquo;s Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform was established in September 2020. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this positive downward trend continues as the reform agenda progresses.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care in order to strengthen waivers and notices. It is my hope that the implementation of these key actions in particular should further help to improve the affordability and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and voluntary groups &ndash; including young drivers in particular. </p></reply>

The injury must be such that the individual is permanently and totally incapacitated from maintaining himself or herself.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 739G TCA applies an exit tax to collective investment undertakings and is generally deducted on the occurrence of a chargeable event. Such chargeable events can arise on the making of relevant payments or on the transfer by a unit holder of their entitlement to units (including on death). An exit tax must always be deducted from payments to investors with the exception of specific categories of investors such as a pension scheme, a life assurance company or a non-resident individual, provided the investment undertaking is in possession of the appropriate declarations in advance of the chargeable event.</p>  <p>  A permanently incapacitated individual who is exempt from tax under section 189 on income from the investment of compensation payments arising from personal injury claims may be entitled to a repayment of the exit tax. Revenue confirmed a refund of exit tax has occurred in such circumstances, where the requirements of section 189 have been met.  However, where income or gains arise to, or are received by, the estate of a deceased individual, the exemption provided for in section 189 would not apply in those circumstances and consequently the repayment of any exit tax deducted cannot be made by Revenue. </p>  <p>  As Revenue was never entitled to make repayments of the exit tax that arises under section 739G TCA to the estate of a deceased individual and there has been no change in the law to permit such refunds, I am advised that there has been no change in Revenue&rsquo;s practice in relation to these matters. </p></reply>

The CRSS operates on a self-assessment basis, and claimants are required to satisfy themselves that they are correctly eligible for the scheme before registering to receive payments. Claimants are also required to review their continued eligibility for the scheme before making a claim for payment in respect of each subsequent claim period.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the CRSS, a business must operate from a business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, requiring it to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its premises. It is not sufficient that a business experiences a reduction in demand for its services or a reduced footfall because of Covid-19 measures. For example, dry cleaning and laundry businesses were not required to restrict customer access under the public health measures and as such do not qualify for the CRSS, even if service demand is reduced. Such businesses may however qualify for the other support schemes introduced to support them during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question operates a dry-cleaning service and incorrectly claimed and received CRSS payments to which it was not entitled, which must be repaid in due course. Revenue has also confirmed that it accepts that the business genuinely believed that it qualified for the scheme and that repayment of the amount owed as a single payment could cause it financial difficulties. To avoid such a scenario to the greatest extent possible, Revenue will engage directly with the business to agree a suitable payment solution, including the possibility of adding the amount owed to its current warehoused debt under the Debt Warehousing Scheme, even though that scheme does not specifically provide for CRSS related liabilities.</p>  <p>  The company may be also eligible to register for the new Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), which is an additional support for businesses with reduced turnover due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Further details on the BRSS, which is now operational, are available on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has confirmed that in addition to receiving financial support through the Debt Warehousing Scheme, the Business is also receiving payments under the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).</p></reply>

No. 318 of 1992.  Apart from this facility to reserve a registration number, there is no scope within the current legislation to provide for a personalised number scheme. This issue has been raised a number of times over the years but the systems development required, including to registration plate recognition systems, would be likely to far outweigh the potential benefits to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that there are no plans to undertake such a review.</p></reply>

Over 80% of WAM graduates have subsequently secured longer-term employment upon completion of their WAM programme.  Officials from my Department are presently scoping the possibility of a confined competition to create permanent civil service employment opportunities for graduates of the WAM programme.</p><p>The Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) programme is an applied learning, development and socialisation programme for adults with an intellectual disability that was launched as a pilot programme in September 2018. It is facilitated by the Houses of the Oireachtas Service in collaboration with two sponsor organisations, KARE and WALK.  The goal of the Programme is to provide trainees with the skills, knowledge and ability to gain meaningful employment via the unique opportunity to gain practical work experience, as well as accredited learning over an 11 month period.  Over a quarter of the initial OWL interns have since gone on to secure permanent civil service employment through confined competitions.</p><p>In terms of civil servants based in my own Department, the HR Unit developed the <i>People@PER</i>HR Strategy that has a focus on embracing and embedding a culture of diversity and inclusion across the Department through diversity initiatives and training.  This has included the establishment of a vibrant cross-Divisional and cross-grade Diversity and Inclusion staff forum.  My Department has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) who supports new members of staff with a disability or existing staff who acquire a disability and raise awareness about disability.  New hires receive the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service, a welcome letter from the Department&rsquo;s DLO and FAQs on Disability prepared by the National Disability Authority.  The induction of new hires includes a presentation and Q&amp;amp;A session with the DLO. </p><p>In September 2020, I published a State Bodies Code of Practice Annex of Gender Balance, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion.  This requires the Chairperson of each board to submit a comprehensive report to the relevant Minister each year that must set out progress in addressing gender, equality and diversity issues. </p><p>In terms of bodies under my aegis, all have appointed Disability Liaison Officers (DLOs) and have proactively made available work placement opportunities for participants on the WAM and OWL programmes, with a number of these being converted to permanent positions.  Embedding diversity and inclusion with each body is a core focus of the respective Management Boards with key ED&amp;amp;I initiatives reflected in existing local HR strategies or those being developed by bodies, such as the EMPOWER People Strategy in the case of the Office of Government Procurement.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring that we continue to build a diverse Civil Service that is reflective of the modern Ireland that we serve.</p></reply>

Upon receipt of a flood warning, Local Authority staff erect the substantial demountable defences on the completed scheme on the north side.</p>  <p>  The flood event which occurred in Fermoy on the night of 22 and morning of 23 February led to three properties flooding on Brian Bor&uacute; Square and flooding in the Town Park area, although no properties flooded there.</p>  <p>  Cork County Council, in conjunction with OPW, have been investigating the possible cause or causes  which led to the February flood event, including investigations regarding the functioning of the pumping stations, at both Rathealy Road, and the Western Embankment.</p>  <p>  Currently a specialist is engaged to provide a full comprehensive diagnostic analysis of both Fermoy North pumping stations. This analysis will aim to determine what occurred in February and to establish if all the original pumping systems are functioning correctly (as designed), and if not to provide appropriate recommendations to rectify any outstanding issues.</p>  <p>  In the interim, Cork Co. Council and OPW have put in measures to prevent an event such as February happening again and following completion of the investigations will carry out any required works to remedy any outstanding issues.</p></reply>

Collectively, these approved organisations make up the PSTN. The rules governing transfer of service in pre-existing public service pension schemes are primarily set out in a Department of Finance Letter to Personnel Officers (24 April 1979) - &lsquo;Draft Transfer Scheme&rsquo; and also in a Letter to Personnel Officers (30 January 1981) - &lsquo;Transfer of Service for Superannuation Purposes&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  For a transfer of pensionable service to be permitted, both bodies are required to be members of the PSTN and the eligibility criteria set out in the 1979 transfer scheme must be met. I can confirm that both the Civil Service and Defence Forces are members of the PSTN. Applications for transfers of service should be directed to the HR or pension administration section of the individual&rsquo;s employer, who are best placed to advise on whether the relevant eligibility criteria are met and a transfer of service is permissible.</p>  <p>  Please note that transfers of pensionable service can only take place between pre-existing pension schemes. The Single Scheme does not operate on the basis of &ldquo;pensionable service&rdquo; and is therefore not covered by the PSTN. The transfer provisions of that scheme relate to money amounts and are set out in DPER Circular 15/2019. </p></reply>

BIM will be phased into public works projects over a four-year period commencing with the large-scale projects initially as the larger technical consultancies and contractors already have the capacity to deliver BIM.</p></reply>

The OPW are currently reviewing the application and a decision is expected to issue in the coming weeks.</p><p>In addition to the above proposals, prior to forecasted extreme weather events, local area staff from Cork County Council are implementing interim measures to assist mitigate flooding, such as deployment of sandbags at Sands Quay and mobile pumping.</p><p>Skibbereen<b>:</b></p><p>The Skibbereen Flood Relief Scheme was substantially completed on 6th June 2019.All identified defects arising from the construction have been remedied, with some delays as a result of Covid-19. </p><p>Planning for the operation and maintenance of the scheme is ongoing in conjunction with Cork County Council, who will act as agents of the OPW in carrying out the statutory operation and maintenance of the scheme.  A small number of works to address elements identified during construction, which were outside the main construction contract, remain to be completed and are being progressed in separate works packages.</p><p>In addition, some drainage works on Cork Road, which fall outside the remit of the main Scheme, have subsequently been identified as being necessary.  Detailed assessments are currently being progressed by Cork County Council and consultants RPS, in conjunction with the OPW and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), to identify the most effective solution.  While work is currently ongoing on the development of a solution, the Council is not yet in a position to confirm the programme times in relation to planning approvals and construction.</p><p>Following the flood event, which occurred in August, 2020 in the Rossa Road area, Cork County Council and its consultants have been undertaking assessments of the problem and these assessments are progressing.  The OPW is providing funding under the Minor Works &amp;amp; Flood Mitigation Scheme towards these works, which involve the upgrade of the Rossa Road culvert trash screen and inlet chamber.  Some discussions have taken place with a local landowner with a view to completing some remedial/improvement works.  Any further works can only be progressed once the required reports are completed.</p><p>Bandon<b>:</b></p><p>The Bandon Flood Relief Scheme was substantially completed on 16th October 2020.</p><p>A number of additional minor items are still planned to be completed, such as fencing, railings and conservation works to Bandon Bridge.</p><p>Work is ongoing on preparing the operation and maintenance plans for the scheme and it is envisaged that the maintenance and operation of the scheme will be carried out for and on behalf of the OPW by Cork County Council. </p><p>As part of the completed Bandon flood relief scheme, the Office of Public Works installed a large &lsquo;rock-ramp&rsquo; fish pass in the Bandon River, measuring some 130m, in October 2018.The fish pass was designed by international experts, with input from national experts in the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLH), along with Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI).</p><p>In March 2021, the OPW became aware that the boulders, rock and gravel material that formed the bed of the ramp had deteriorated, possibly as a result of extreme flows in the river in February 2021. The OPW immediately carried out inspections, accompanied by IFI representatives and the fisheries&rsquo; specialist on the Project which identified serious deterioration of the rock and gravel bed materials used in the construction of the fish pass, over its full length.  Of immediate concern was the erosion of bed material at the upstream end of the fish pass, which had resulted in the retaining wall, originally constructed below the bed level of the pass, becoming exposed and creating a &lsquo;step&rsquo; up from the bed level immediately downstream of it, which was creating serious difficulties for various aquatic species in migrating over this newly exposed &lsquo;step&rsquo; at the upstream end of the fish pass, particularly in low flows.</p><p>The OPW and IFI agreed that urgent measures were required to alleviate this problem, which, following all appropriate assessments and approvals, were carried out successfully.</p><p>While these emergency works were critical in solving the immediate problem, an investigation into the reasons for the deterioration of the bed material on the fish pass is ongoing and a longer term solution will be developed with a view to fully rectifying the issue with the carrying out of any necessary works when the investigations are completed. </p><p>Clonakilty<b>:</b></p><p>The Clonakilty Flood Relief Scheme undertaken by the Office of Public Works in partnership with Cork County Council was substantially completed on 4th February 2021 by the main contractor, Ward and Burke Ltd and now provides protection to 296 properties.</p><p>A number of works to address outstanding items and snags to be completed by the contractor are currently ongoing.</p><p>Planning for the operation and maintenance of the scheme is ongoing in conjunction with Cork County Council, who will act as agents of the OPW in carrying out the statutory operation and maintenance of the scheme.</p></reply>

This &euro;8.1 billion under &lsquo;temporary spending&rsquo; heading in Table 4 of the SES is made up of the non-core expenditure areas listed Table 8, intended to address the specific challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit. This comprises &euro;7 billion for measures in response to Covid-19 and Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;1.1 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve allocation. </p>  <p>  In addition to the &euro;1.5 billion indicated for automatic stabilisers, primarily job-seekers payments, &euro;5.3 billion is indicated as Covid-19 measures and contingency. This combines the &euro;2.5 billion included in the Stability Programme Update to meet pressures that may remain in delivering public services in line with any continued public health requirements and the &euro;2.8 billion contingency reserve set out in the SES.  Given the continued uncertainty in relation to Covid-19 and the requirement to ensure that supports are carefully withdrawn in a manner that supports recovery in the economy, this contingency reserve will allow Government flexibility to respond as the situation with the virus evolves.  A further &euro;0.2 billion relates to funding under our National Recovery and Resilience Plan expected to be spent in 2022.  </p>  <p>  Further to this, Ireland has been allocated &euro;1.1 billion under the EU&rsquo;s Brexit Adjustment Reserve, to fund measures to address the negative impacts of Brexit across the eligible period of the fund. The full allocation has been assigned to 2022 on a technical basis. However, this funding will likely be allocated across Budget 2022 and Budget 2023. </p>  <p>  Decisions on specific measures to be covered by this funding, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, and allocations to Departments will be made as part of the Estimates process. As in 2021, it is intended that all expenditure allocations related to Covid-19 will be separately identified in the Expenditure Report to ensure transparency. </p></reply>

At the end of 2019, the company had 20 full time staff employed and has now grown to 39 staff, with plans for further expansion.</p><p>The company operates in the green economy and the business is based on sustainable and innovative recycling solutions for the industrial plastic industry. Novelplast recycles and repurposes industrial offcut filament and fibre material from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) manufacturing facilities in order to make PET pellets/chips.</p><p>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta committed funding for the upgrade of the building to bring it to the required industry specifications, along with substantial extra works specified by the client company, Novelplast. The total capital expenditure on the project to date is c. &euro;2.8m.  A substantial portion of this relates to the extra works specified by the company, in respect of which &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will be repaid in full by the company as is the norm with such expenditure.

Working with State agencies, LAWPRO assists with the development and implementation of river basin management plans, which sets out the actions Ireland will take in order to improve the quality of our aquatic environment and meet the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive. </p><p>As part of Ireland&rsquo;s second River Basin Management Plan, 190 Priority Areas for Action (PAA) were identified around which LAWPRO&rsquo;s work is concentrated. These are catchment areas that have been prioritised for focussed scientific assessment to understand the issues affecting water quality. Working with local communities, landowners, business owners and public bodies, LAWPRO then seeks to develop relevant and workable solutions to identified issues. There are 44 PAA&rsquo;s in the South East region (Laois, Kilkenny, Carlow, Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary, some overlap into Wicklow, Offaly and Limerick).  </p><p>The first step of LAWPRO&rsquo;s work in a PAA, is to improve the scientific understanding by gathering and collating all relevant and available data into a Desktop Study Report.  This ensures there is a focus on the issues that are significantly affecting water quality and the mitigation actions that should prioritised.  </p><p>Another important aspect of LAWPRO&rsquo;s work in the PAA&rsquo;s is informing and working with local communities. Following their desktop studies and prior to commencing their fieldwork assessments, LAWPRO organises a community information meeting to discuss the water body with local people and interest groups. Local meetings are followed by farmer engagement events organised by advisors from the collaborative Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme, with the support of LAWPRO staff. Work to this stage has been completed for 34 of the PAA&rsquo;s in the South East region.</p><p>Using this and other scientific information, LAWPRO catchment scientists then begin their fieldwork, walking the riverbanks and taking water samples to assess the condition of the river. Once the fieldwork is concluded and analysed, LAWPRO discuss the outcome of the assessment with the relevant implementing bodies or landowners, agreeing timelines for implementation of measures to improve water quality. The advisors from the Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme will discuss any agricultural measures with the farmers. </p><p>Noting the impact of the COVID emergency on their work, particularly the community meetings and fieldwork elements, to date LAWPRO have completed 11 overall assessments, with fieldwork in 18 PAA&rsquo;s currently ongoing.</p><p>A summary of the PAA&rsquo;s in the South East Regions is outlined below, with further information available on LAWPRO&rsquo;s website at <i>awaters.ie/priority-areas-for-action/</i>.  Additional information on water quality and the status of waters can also be viewed on <i>www.catchments.ie</i>.</p><p>As key commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department is currently preparing a new strengthened River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, to cover the period 2022 &ndash; 2027. Further advancing Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, the new plan will build on the work of the second-cycle, again describing the main pressures and activities affecting water status and setting out the environmental objectives to be achieved up to 2027. The plan will also identify the measures needed to achieve these objectives, including a proposed expansion of the Areas for Action. </p><p>A draft plan is due to be published shortly for a 6 month public consultation, so I would urge everyone to please engage in this process once the consultation is launched.</p><p><b>PAA Progress Summary for the South East Region:  </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Area for action</th>       <th>County</th>       <th>Catchment</th>       <th>Progress status</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Aherlow</td>       <td>Tipperary/Limerick</td>       <td>Suir</td>       <td>Fieldwork underway</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ara</td>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>Suir</td>       <td>Fieldwork underway</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Athy Stream</td>       <td>Kildare/Laois</td>       <td>Barrow</td>       <td>Fieldwork completed</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballyfinboy (Upper)</td>       <td>Offaly/Tipperary</td>       <td>Lower Shannon</td>       <td>Not commenced yet</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballyroan</td>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>Nore</td>       <td>Not commenced yet</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bannow</td>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>Ballyteighe-Bannow</td>       <td>Fieldwork underway</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Blackwater (Wexford)</td>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>Owenavorragh</td>       <td>Not commenced yet</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Borrisoleigh</td>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>Lower Shannon</td>       <td>Not commenced yet</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bregagh (Kilkenny)</td>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>Nore</td>       <td>Initial Public Engagement completed</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Brownstown (Pococke)</td>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>Nore</td>       <td>Not commenced yet</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bunow</td>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>Lower Shannon</td>       <td>Initial Public Engagement completed</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Burren</td>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>Barrow</td>       <td>Fieldwork underway</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clashawley</td>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>Suir</td>       <td>LCA report completed</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clodiagh (Portlaw)</td>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>Suir</td>       <td>Fieldwork completed</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Colligan-Brickey</td>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>Colligan-Mahon</td>       <td>Fieldwork underway</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dead &amp;amp;

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on the Department's website at the following link:www.gov.ie/en/publication/04c69-social-housing-support-table-of-income-limits/  </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordable housing both for purchase and for cost rental.</p>  <p>  Finally, the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016 was extended to the end of 2021 and a review of the priority actions outlined within the strategy is being undertaken this year. A period of research and consultation is taking place to inform the development of a new Housing Strategy.

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned.  The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern and are being taken very seriously.  It is important that we establish the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response on the best knowledge and evidence available.  </p>  <p>  While the information requested in respect of the number of deaths of homeless service users is not compiled in my Department, a feasibility study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. This is due to be completed by the end of 2021.  The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, is reviewing approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts.</p>  <p>  A review of homeless deaths was undertaken on behalf of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) by Dr. Austin O&rsquo;Carroll, the HSE appointed Clinical Lead for Covid-19 and Homelessness in Dublin.  The review analysed the available data concerning deaths in homeless services for 2020 to identify learning for homeless and health services that could help tailor the provision of care to homeless people. This &lsquo;Interim Report on Mortality in Single Homeless Population 2020&rsquo; was completed in June 2021.  Owing to certain data limitations, including Covid-19 restrictions limiting access to coroner&rsquo;s reports, the report will be subject to revision when further data becomes available. I have met with Dr. O&rsquo;Carroll to discuss his Report and its recommendations.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to ensure that all individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit into permanent housing solutions and that those with complex health and mental health needs are provided with the supports they need. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in respect of these issues.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland&rsquo; is the Government&rsquo;s strategic housing plan to 2030. It includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs. It commits to the continued expansion of Housing First, and, importantly, ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided.  An individual health care plan will be provided for all homeless individuals that need one.</p>  <p>  In particular, engaging with rough sleepers is vital.  This engagement is first and foremost to encourage those rough sleeping to avail of shelter.  But critically, it also allows their health needs to be assessed and provided for.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

The National Park is now served by a world-class visitor centre at Killarney House, which forms a gateway experience to Killarney National Park. It seeks to educate and encourage exploration and participation, creating a link between the tangible and intangible heritage of the Park. </p>  <p>  As previously signalled,  if the use of the premises was to be altered in the future, it would need to go through a planning application for change of use.  This application could take some period of time, and would also produce a financial commitment. At present, casual trading is not allowed within Killarney National Park. Notwithstanding the above, if it were to proceed to leasing for business, the entire process and award of such a venture would be subject to a tendering process, which would be an open competition.</p>  <p>  While consideration could be given in the future to re-purposing the Unit, subject to a change of use application being made under the Planning and Development Acts, it would however require capital funding being re-directed from elsewhere in the Park. Moreover, there exists already  significant parking issues at this location and a commercial operation at this site would only exacerbate this problem. Accordingly, the development of this unit is not a priority at present.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-09a.934.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021090900018#WRQ07200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316, 318, 319, 327, 331 to 334, inclusive, 339, 344, 351 and 383 together.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended (the Act), all development, unless specifically exempted under the Act or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.  Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.</p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational/community/religious buildings.</p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. This mapping process will take approximately nine months to complete.</p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department proposes to advance interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The SEA process, involving a public consultation on the proposals, is currently underway and is expected to be completed by mid-December 2021. </p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in early 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in early 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner. </p></reply>

This framework will inform the development of organisation level blended working policies tailored to the specific requirements of each Department/Office, whilst ensuring a consistency of approach across key policy areas.</p><p>My Department, in line with its ICT strategy, has adopted the Build to Share (BTS) Managed Desktop shared service provided by OGCIO &ndash; Office of the Government&rsquo;s Chief Information Officer. End of life devices were replaced between 2019 and 2020 with laptops as per the Department&rsquo;s Single Device Policy. My Department incurred an expense of &euro;90,156 in mobile communication costs since March 2020 to support remote working. It is expected that future mobile communications costs will be minimised due to the adoption of the BTS Managed Desktop service, which includes a suite of communications tools that further support remote working at no additional cost.</p><p>Further, the Met &Eacute;ireann Division of my Department purchased laptops, monitors and accessories for staff to facilitate remote/hybrid working during the pandemic.

The Vacant Homes Action Plan identifies the scale of vacant homes in their jurisdiction and sets ambitious but realistic targets of the number of vacant homes that can ultimately be brought back into use. As part of this process, the Vacant Homes Office/Officers within each local authority have undertaken initial vacancy assessment exercises (drilling into available vacancy data), and carry out co-ordinating visual inspections / assessment of residential properties in their administrative area, with a view to identifying possible vacant recoverable homes. In this context, among other sources of information, geo-mapping is utilised by many local authorities, with mapping of vacancy is carried out by GIS staff or the Vacant Homes Officer, where resources permit.</p>  <p>  My Department does not, however, collate this information centrally, but the broader question of gathering data on vacancy will be considered as part of the implementation of Housing for All.  This will include the collection of data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax. The Local Property Tax returns in November 2021 will provide a new source of information in this regard.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits, and maintenance payments received is assessable. There is no provision in the policy to deduct any other regular outgoings, such as maintenance paid in respect of family members, from gross household income for the purposes of the income threshold.</p>  <p>  When a maintenance payment is made, it will be to cover the cost of living for their children, which is the same cost incurred by a couple with children that are still living together as a family unit.

The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>-  Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.);</p>  <p>-  established Health and Safety needs;</p>  <p>-  state of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.?); and</p>  <p>-  value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>- This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p>  <p>- Project consideration stages in my Department include submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals; submission of design brief; selection of site; application for approval in principle; appointment of design consultants; submission of a preliminary design; planning application; submission of preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans; and tender process and construction stages - each step subject to approval from my Department.</p>  <p>- While a new fire station at Ballymahon is not currently included in my Department&rsquo;s 2021 &ndash; 2025 Fire Services Capital Programme, it is included in a list for annual review. Projects in the Capital Programme will be reassessed on an annual basis in order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding. This includes consideration of additional fire station projects from fire authorities which fit the normal fire station project criteria and where an appropriate business case is presented. Priority may be adjusted to bring forward projects offering best value-for-money and to take account of the state of readiness of the projects.</p>  <p>- Longford County Council has indicated that the replacement of Ballymahon Fire Station, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.7 million, is their priority.

Existing use value is the value of the land without the benefit of planning permission and is generally less than the market value, particularly for greenfield sites. </p><p>The purpose of Part V is to achieve a housing mix rather than having housing estates of a mono tenure.  It ensures that all applicable housing developments contain some social housing as well as owner occupied and potentially also private rented housing.  The exclusion of developer profit and land value planning gain from the price payable for Part V units means that they can be acquired at less than their open market value.</p><p>A local authority&rsquo;s options under Part V to capture the 10% of net monetary value are -</p><p>- the transfer of ownership of land, subject to the planning permission application, to a local authority for the provision of social housing (the default option);</p><p>- the building and transfer of ownership to the local authority, or persons nominated, of completed social homes on the site subject to the planning permission;</p><p>- the transfer of ownership to the local authority, or persons nominated, of completed social housing homes on other land;</p><p>- the long term leasing of social housing homes; and</p><p>- a combination of the options above.</p><p>My Department records Part V unit data based on the expenditure recouped by the local authorities.  However, local authorities may take land as part of the Part V agreement and we don&rsquo;t have sight of this until the LA develops a proposal to build units on that land, which may not be for a number of years.  It is therefore not possible to provide complete details of the net benefit to the Exchequer in discounted terms of Part V agreements concluded between 2012 to date, compared with traditional provision of social housing by local authorities.</p><p>However, I am setting out below data comparing the cost of Part V units acquired by local authorities with tendered costs for local authority-led construction of social homes, for each of the years 2017 to 2020.  The construction costs vary depending on design, type of units (e.g. bedroom numbers, apartment/house), and on the level of abnormal cost requirements for each scheme, such as site conditions, demolitions, service diversions and site access requirements.  The costs below relate to the construction element only of the all-in delivery cost. Other items that make up the all-in delivery cost, but which are excluded from the figures shown, include the following:</p><p><b>- Design/technical fees</b>: Design fees vary from project to project, depending on the location, size and complexity of a scheme (and depending on whether design services are provided by a local authority in-house or via external appointment). As a guideline/indicator, design fee generally range between 7.5% and 12.5% of construction costs:</p><p><b>- Land cost</b>: Land costs can vary significantly from project to project, depending on location and ownership status (e.g. land costs could vary from existing local authority land with no cost to land purchased at market value).</p><p><b>- Utilities</b>: Connection fees for Irish Water, ESB, gas, etc. As a guideline/indicator, utility connection costs are generally in the order of &euro;7k per unit.</p><p><b>- Other Costs</b>: Other elements that can make up the all-in delivery cost can include site investigations/ surveys, archaeological requirements, Percent for Art contributions - and will vary from scheme to scheme. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Average Cost<br /><br />  Per Unit &ndash; LA Construction (excluding items listed above)</th>       <th>Average Cost Per Unit &ndash; Part V</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>185,935</td>       <td>184,971</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>222,085</td>       <td>215,915</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>239,837</td>       <td>224,514</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>205,111</td>       <td>234,373</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

A Progress Report was prepared each year based on the data and analysis from each survey. The most recent reports and auxiliary data are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/706ac-unfinished-housing-developments-annual-reports/</i>.</p><p>Approximately 3,000 developments were surveyed in 2010. The 2017 survey identified that overall there had been a 91% reduction of &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; developments since 2010 with 256 developments remaining on the &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; list. Of these 256 developments in 2017 only 159 were occupied in some part by residents.</p><p>In September 2020 my Department asked local authorities to re-evaluate and assess the remaining 256 developments. These developments were surveyed by the local authorities in September / October 2020 and within this cohort of 256 developments, it was found that there was a 52% reduction in &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; developments since 2017. Of the 256 developments surveyed, the number of developments classified as &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; from the 2017 survey had almost halved to 124 developments nationally, which is a 96% reduction from the initial number of unfinished developments surveyed in 2010.  From the 256 developments surveyed:</p><p>- 132 of the 256 developments are now being removed from the list of unfinished developments because they are substantially complete and / or active sites that are now finishing. Many of these developments will now progress to being considered for taking in charge by the relevant local authority. </p><p>- 124 developments remain &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo;.</p><p>Of the 124 unfinished developments, 326 houses and 13 apartments were vacant at the time of survey in 2020.  The table below outlines the breakdown by county, including those that were fully unoccupied. </p><p>Unfinished Developments by County, September 2020  <table>    <tr>       <th>LA</th>       <th>Total Developments</th>       <th>Total Unoccupied</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b> </b></td>       <td><b>124</b></td>       <td><b>57</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>A list of unfinished housing estates can be found under the &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; tab layer on the MyPlan website available at the following link: <i>www.myplan.ie</i>.</p><p>In the line with the commitment in Housing for All, local authorities will continue to assess the best options for resolution of unfinished developments and/or developments that are to be taken in charge.</p></reply>

The Scheme opened for applications at the end of June 2020. </p><p>Significant preparatory work was carried out to investigate and quantify the extent of the problem in both Donegal and Mayo and designing a scheme to address the issue. My Department is in ongoing engagement with local authorities and local action groups that are currently within the scope of the scheme and with the relevant local authorities in respect of discussions on requests for an extension of the scheme to other counties. </p><p>My Department informed councils requesting admittance to the scheme that before any extension of the scheme can be considered, the same rigorous analysis as that put in place prior to the rollout of the scheme to the counties of Donegal and Mayo would have to be undertaken. There is an opportunity here for the local authority concerned to take a lead role in determining, in accordance with the IS: 465 protocol, that issues arising in homes in County Tipperary are in fact due to the presence of excessive amounts of deleterious materials (mica or pyrite) in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks and secondly quantify the likely extent of the problem in the county.</p><p>Such analysis will provide the evidential basis necessary for the consideration of any extension of the scheme. Pending the receipt of and consideration of such analysis it would be premature to consider an extension of the scheme. </p></reply>

They considered how the benefits of the grants could be spread as widely as possible and to achieve fairness and value for money in the grants process. Arising from the recommendations of the review group, the income requirements, eligibility and maximum grant were revised in 2014 to focus the grants towards those with the greatest need. </p>  <p>  As detailed in Housing for All, housing policy objectives 6 and 7 give a commitment to undertaking a review of the range of housing grants available to assist with meeting specific housing needs both for our ageing population and people with a disability.

This circular also included a revised single application form for use by all local authorities. </p>  <p>  The new form and guidelines cover the operation of the three grant schemes available, namely the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant and the Housing Aid for Older People Grant, and came into effect from 1 February 2020.</p>  <p>  The schemes are means tested and operate on a sliding scale with the highest percentage grants available to those with the lowest incomes and vice versa.  Grant assistance is available to applicants whose household income, after disregards and deductions, does not exceed &euro;60,000 per annum. Local authorities must adhere to the income thresholds set down by the regulations, so that the funding is focused on those households that need it most. </p>  <p>  Local authorities, in administering the scheme, should always work with qualifying applicants to ensure they get the most beneficial outcome possible in line with their financial circumstances. Engagement with the Local Authorities throughout the year is on-going and my Department provides individual workshops to Local Authorities to offer advice and ensure the scheme is being administered optimally. </p>  <p>  The Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability make a very significant contribution to improving comfort levels within the home for older persons and persons with a disability and this in turn reduces the potential numbers requiring admittance to long term care facilities. In 2019, across all 31 local authorities areas, a total of 10,023 applicants benefited from assistance under the 3 grant schemes. </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;75 million is available nationally in 2021 for the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme.

These are the Historic Structures Fund (HSF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS). The HSF is for conservation and enhancement to heritage structures and historic buildings, in both private and public ownership, for the benefit of communities and the public. The BHIS is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures (RPS). It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small-scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular building you mentioned I am pleased to say that funding has been allocated this year under the Historic Structures Fund and that funding may be drawn down on completion of works towards the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The BHIS has been allocated &euro;3m this year, up 20% on 2020. The HSF has also been allocated &euro;3m this year. Details of the projects to be funded under both schemes were announced earlier this year and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

In exceptional cases my Department recognises that there may be an urgency to commence works prior to formal grant approval issuing. In such circumstances, where a local authority has been afforded the opportunity to inspect the property prior to any works commencing, grant approval may, at the discretion of the local authority, issue retrospectively where they are satisfied that the works were necessary and that they needed to be carried out as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  Local authorities, in administering the grant schemes, should always work with qualifying applicants to ensure they get the most beneficial outcome possible under the terms of the schemes.</p></reply>

The oversight role of the OPR includes ensuring consistency with relevant national or regional policies, including those set out in the NPF and addressing all relevant mandatory objectives for County Development Plans set out in the Planning and Development Act, including the provision of Gaeltacht-specific objectives, where required.</p>  <p>  In relation to planning applications for development, a planning authority must notify the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, to invite their views in relation to planning applications for developments which, in the opinion of the authority &ldquo;might materially affect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, including the promotion of Irish as the community language&rdquo; in accordance with Article 28 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended). The decision to grant or refuse planning permission in such cases, and to assign conditions, including conditions relating to language where appropriate, to a grant of planning permission, is ultimately a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  I am of the view that considering the unique spatial and linguistic circumstances relating to each of our Gaeltacht areas, with local variation between communities and the contexts in which the Irish Language is spoken, that the relevant planning authorities are best placed to implement the planning framework of legislation, policy and guidance as set out above. I am also satisfied that there are appropriate planning oversight mechanisms and safeguards in place, which include the Office of the Planning Regulator and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  </p>  <p>  A number of Irish language groups, including Conradh na Gaeilge, raised matters with a view to improving the practical implementation of the Irish language provisions in Gaeltacht areas.  On foot of the proposals put forward by Conradh na Gaeilge, my Department convened a working group during the summer to examine various aspects of the planning process in all Gaeltacht areas.  Membership of this group is made up of representatives from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and relevant local authorities.  My Department is committed to working with the relevant stakeholders in the coming months with a view to agreeing practical improvements and best practice processes that will support and enhance the important policy and legislative provisions that are in place. </p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. </p><p>From 1 July 2019, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 empowers the RTB, on its own volition or on foot of a complaint, to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct including a contravention of the rent setting laws in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs). The RTB can impose a sanction of up to &euro;30,000 and publish any sanction imposed on its website &ndash; <i>www.rtb.ie</i>. All residential tenancy dispute determination orders are also published on its website. </p><p>When registering a tenancy, a landlord is required to inform the RTB of the rent amount and again if there is an update to that rent amount. In setting a rent, a landlord cannot exceed the market rent. In general, a rent in respect of a dwelling cannot be reviewed more frequently than annually in a RPZ, or bi-annually outside of a RPZ. In reviewing a rent, a landlord must complete the Notice of Rent Review (available on the RTB&rsquo;s website) which must be served on the tenant at least 90 days before the new rent becomes payable and requires details of the rent last set for the dwelling and, if the dwelling is in an RPZ,  comply with procedures providing for the rent increase restriction and use the Rent Pressure Zone calculator to ensure compliance with the rent setting laws. </p><p>A landlord can identify the application of an exemption from the RPZ laws in respect of a particular dwelling in the Notice of Rent Review, if relevant. A landlord must include details of 3 comparable rents in the Notice of Rent Review.</p><p>Section 12 of the Residential Tenancies Acts obliges a landlord, in the case of a tenancy of a dwelling in a RPZ, furnish the tenant, in writing, with the following information at the commencement of the tenancy:</p><p>(i) the amount of rent that was last set under a tenancy for the dwelling;</p><p>(ii) the date the rent was last set under a tenancy for the dwelling;</p><p>(iii) a statement as to how the rent set under the tenancy of the dwelling has been calculated having regard to section 19 (setting of rent above the market rent prohibited) of the Acts. </p><p>A tenant can refer a dispute with regard to rent setting to the RTB for resolution under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Acts, with a landlord potentially liable to pay damages of up to &euro;20,000. Comprehensive information on rent setting procedures is available on the RTB&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Rent data is collected by the RTB in respect of individual rented dwellings through its tenancy registration process and through data exchange agreements under the Residential Tenancies Acts. This data informs the RTB's function to investigate, and potentially sanction, unlawful rent setting.  The RTB publishes a Quarterly Rent Index on its website presenting anonymised and aggregated data to safeguard privacy and protect data.</p></reply>

If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household.</p><p>The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.  The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child. The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. </p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordable housing both for purchase and for cost rental.</p><p>Where MTR is not an option, it will be a matter for the borrower to discuss with their lender if there are other options available to resolve their mortgage arrears solution.  The Abhaile service is a national mortgage arrears resolution service provided free of charge to the borrower and its aim is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The Money Advice and Budgetary Service (MABS) acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning (076) 1072000 or by accessing their website at: <i>www.mabs.ie/abhaile</i>.</p></reply>

The range of objectives and actions it specifies have been pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock. The key drivers of these actions are: local authorities, the Housing Agency, and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by schemes available within my Department specifically designed to tackle vacancy, such as the Repair and Lease Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme and the Long Term Leasing Scheme.</p><p>On 2 September, 2021, the Government published Housing for All, which has a specific pathway on addressing vacancy and ensuring the efficient use of our housing stock.  This builds on the actions undertaken the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy, and reflects a range of actions to tackle this aspect of housing.

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provides for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living. </p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities. Part V homes are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration. </p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

They are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation. Part M of the Building Regulations deals with Access and Use. The associated Technical Guidance Document M provides guidance indicating how the requirements of Part M can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with TGD M, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part M of the Second Schedule of the Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment. While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, my Department established a Working Group to examine the provision for a changing places toilet in certain buildings. A changing places toilet offers larger supported facilities that address the needs of people for whom current accessible sanitary accommodation is inadequate. These facilities enable people with complex care needs to take part in everyday activities such as travel, shopping, family days out or attending a sporting event.</p>  <p>  The plenary Working Group has met six times to date, in addition to a number of sub-group meetings.  Draft documentation, which includes Draft Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2021, Draft Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use 2021 and a Regulatory Impact Analysis, is currently being prepared  to support a  public consultation in the matter later this  year.</p></reply>

The report draws on a very substantial body of scientific work led by NPWS in collaboration with external experts, working together over a period of six years. The assessments in the report help to inform important decisions around my Department&rsquo;s work programme.</p>  <p>  There are a number of priority actions that are being taken in my Department and across Government to improve the conservation status of estuaries, lagoons and tidal mudflats and sandflats, and other habitats and species that are protected by the European Union&rsquo;s Birds and Habitats Directives. </p>  <p>  The updated Prioritised Action Framework for the Implementation Birds and Habitats Directives was approved by Government in March this year and has been submitted to the European Commission in line with Article 8 of the Habitats Directive. </p>  <p>  With regard to coastal lagoons, water quality and hydrological issues are among the main pressures on these habitats. The main conservation measures required relate to the improvement of water quality in lagoon catchments and the restoration of hydrological processes, including once-off infrastructural measures to manage water regimes as well as ongoing measures to reduce nutrient inputs. While measures to improve water quality will continue to be required and delivered through the river basin planning process, specific targeted programmes will also be required, particularly for the large sedimentary lagoons of the south-east coast.</p>  <p>  My Department is co-funding a project with the Environmental Protection Agency called CLEAR (Coastal Lagoons: Ecology and Restoration). This project will answer critical scientific questions about the ecological dynamics of our coastal lagoons, as well as a detailed plan for the restoration of Lady&rsquo;s Island Lake in Wexford, one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest, and proposed restoration methods that will be applicable to other sites. This project represents a critical step in mapping out what specific actions will be required to restore our coastal lagoons. It is due to report in 2022. </p>  <p>  With regard to estuaries and tidal mudflats and sandflats, my Department&rsquo;s recent reports have also concluded that eutrophication and damage to keystone marine communities are the key issues driving their conservation status. </p>  <p>  My Department is developing Ireland&rsquo;s next River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) 2022-2027, a key tool for the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s Water Framework Directive and for the improvement of water quality in Ireland. The water quality requirements of the habitats protected by the Habitats Directive, such as coastal lagoons, estuaries, and tidal mudflats and sandflats, are being considered in the prioritisation of areas and actions in the new RBMP. The next Nitrates Action Programme is also currently out for public consultation by my Department; this will be the primary policy instrument to reduce nutrient losses from agricultural land to freshwater and subsequent loads to the marine environment.</p></reply>

Action 6.2 of the plan requires that that the Housing Delivery Plans of local authorities will set out how dedicated social housing provision appropriate to the needs of older people will be delivered matching the scale and extent of housing need for older people identified.

Part of the impetus for this work arises from the review of fire safety in Ireland carried out in the the aftermath of the Grenfell tragedy in the UK. It is also my intention that the Bill will place relevant elements of evolved emergency management practice at national and local level on a statutory footing and also revise the legislative approach to certain aspects of public safety in Ireland, with an initial focus on safety at funfairs.</p>  <p>  A General Scheme of the Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation within my Department. The General Scheme has been informed by consultation with the relevant sectors likely to be impacted by its provisions. The shape of the Bill has been considered on a number of occasions by the Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM). The Board is comprised of Chief Executive Officers from local authorities, the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) as well as other Government Departments and supports the general approach being taken in the Bill.</p>  <p>  The intention of the Bill is to support and strengthen the role of local authorities.  The provision of fire services in local authority areas, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises, is a statutory function of each individual fire authority.  The work of local authority fire services has, to a large degree, been underpinned by the Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003 for nearly 40 years.  While this legislation has served the country well, and key indicators such as fatalities from fire per million of population have been reduced consistently to the point where they are at their lowest for forty years, it is appropriate now to ensure that the underpinning legislation fully reflects the changes is society and the expanded and more dynamic roles that our local authority fire services have taken on in recent years.  For that reason, the opinions of the local government sector have been sought as to the shape this legislation should take and preliminary opinion has also been received from the Local Government Management Association.</p>  <p>  Like all legislation, this is a complex piece of work, which necessitates consideration of multifaceted issues that impact on a number of sectors. The current Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 have stood the test of time for nearly 40 years. I want to ensure that its replacement also stands the test of time and when my Department is satisfied that the legislation being brought forward is appropriate, balanced, complete and robust. A Memorandum will be brought to Government on the issue in due course, followed by publication of the Bill.</p></reply>

It is difficult to assess the sustainability of hunting these birds, as there are some gaps in the data on population size and trends and we do not have information on the numbers of birds hunted annually. It is clear that a new way forward is needed, based on scientific evidence, collaboration and strategic action, to ensure the sustainable hunting of birds of conservation concern in Ireland. To this end, I have established a working group in NPWS to determine the next steps and to invite stakeholders to participate in a collaborative dialogue in the coming months to develop a plan for a sustainable future for these species in Ireland.</p></reply>

However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, local authorities are also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  Guidelines on inter-authority movement were issued to local authorities to facilitate the movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant wishes to access rented accommodation, with HAP support, in another local authority area. Inter authority movement is, however, subject to certain conditions, such as the relevant Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority. </p>  <p>  In order to maintain equity between all tenants in receipt of social housing support, inter-authority movement for HAP will be facilitated without reference to Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands in areas that offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes, as no change to existing treatment is involved in such areas. For example, in Dublin, the four local authority areas currently offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes. </p>  <p>  However, HAP tenants who avail of inter-authority movement, can only be offered access to the transfer list of the originating local authority.</p>  <p>  The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities. The making of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.</p></reply>

The proposed new arrangements will effectively restore decision-making on such large scale developments to local authorities in the first instance.</p>  <p>  The proposed new LSRD arrangements will comprise 3 pillars: pre-application consultation stage, planning application stage and appeal stage, summarised as follows - </p>  <p>- planning authorities will be required to complete the &ldquo;final consultation meeting&rdquo; element of the pre-application consultation stage, involving a bilateral  meeting between the planning authority and the developer, within 8 weeks of the receipt of a request for such meeting;</p>  <p>- subsequent LSRD planning applications will be generally required to be determined by planning authorities within 8 weeks of receipt of an application;</p>  <p>- the determination of appeals against planning decisions by planning authorities will be generally required to be determined by An Bord Pleanala within 16 weeks of receipt of an appeal. </p>  <p>- The application of these new arrangements is intended to streamline the decision making process for  LSRDs, thereby providing greater certainty and clarity to developers regarding the timelines for decisions in respect of such development proposals. </p>  <p>- Further details in relation to the proposals are set out in the General Scheme which is available on at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/a10f2-general-scheme-of-planning-and-development-amendment-lsrd-bill-2021/.  </p>  <p>- It is intended that the Bill will be enacted as soon as possible with the new LSRD arrangements commencing on enactment of the Bill. The LSRD and SHD schemes will both operate concurrently for a limited period of time with developers being able to choose which process to engage with during this interim period. Once the final SHD planning applications have worked their way through the system, the LSRD arrangements will be the sole planning consent system for applications of this scale.</p></reply>

The Board had granted permission in 210 cases in respect of a total of 52,311 housing units (comprising 13,199 houses, 29,938 apartments and 9,174 build to rent), as well as 1,330 shared accommodation units and 13,091 student bed spaces under the SHD arrangements.

There can be some delay for various reasons, such as phasing of development, in the activation of housing developments post the granting of permission. In this connection, if permissions granted in 2020/2021 are excluded from the calculations, the data indicates that works have commenced on 48% of the SHD permissions granted in 2018 (when the first permissions were granted) and 2019.  </p><p>Analysis of the end July 2021 position by county as requested is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority</th>       <th>Developments with Decision Granted</th>       <th>Developments with Commencement Notices Lodged</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City Council</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County Council</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City Council</td>       <td>49</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown   County Council</td>       <td>47</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal County Council</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City Council </td>       <td>8</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County Council</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare County Council</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny County Council</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois County Council</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County   Council</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth County Council</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath County Council</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin County Council</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary County Council </td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City and County   Council</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath County Council</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow County Council</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Planning permissions are generally granted for a period of five years with the possibility to extend that period by an additional two periods, which periods cumulatively shall not exceed five years, to enable the development to which the permission relates to be completed subject to compliance with certain conditions.</p><p>The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future commits to not extending the SHD arrangements beyond their legislative expiry date of end December 2021, which has now been extended to 25 February 2022 arising from the Covid-related extension of duration of statutory deadlines within the planning system by 8 weeks in respect of the period March to May 2020. </p><p>Minister O'Brien brought a Memorandum to Government on 13 July 2021, accompanied by a General Scheme of a Planning and Development (Amendment) (LSRD) Bill 2021 (the General Scheme), outlining proposals for the replacement of the current planning arrangements in respect of Strategic Housing Developments (SHDs) with new streamlined arrangements for large-scale residential developments (LSRDs).</p><p>Further details in relation to the proposals are set out in the General Scheme which is available on at:<i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/a10f2-general-scheme-of-planning-and-development-amendment-lsrd-bill-2021/</i></p></reply>

The option of building a new home, outside of the existing foundations, would not be supported by the legislation underpinning the grant scheme. This legislation specifically provides for the payment of a grant for the improvement of an existing dwelling and not the construction of an entirely new building on a new set of foundations. Under the scheme as currently formulated, a homeowner choosing to build a new home in a different location on the site and not using the existing foundations would disqualify themselves from grant assistance.</p>  <p>  The working group which I established to review the current scheme is expected to report by the end of September and the issue of alternative accommodation and the associated costs is one of the issues under review. In addition, my Department is in onging dialogue with Donegal County Council on the particularly difficult circumstances of this case in efforts to identify a solution and will continue to provide as much assistance as possible in order to arrive at a suitable solution.</p></reply>

It is not be possible for me to speculate as to the number of housing projects, which have already availed of an extension under section 42 of the Act, or further extension under section 42(1A), and which will also avail of a further extension under the amendments introduced by the 2021 Act. Rather, it will be a matter for the relevant planning authority to determine whether the conditions for granting a further extension are satisfied on a case by case basis. In other words, this provision does not provide a blanket extension of duration for a certain class or classes of developments, but rather must be determined on a case by case basis by the relevant planning authority upon application to that authority.</p>  <p>  It is understood that construction work has been significantly impacted, with both delays and site closures throughout 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated restrictions, and most recently with the closure of non-essential construction sites on the 8 January 2021, which sites could only have reopened in April and May of this year at earliest.  It is envisaged that an additional extension of 2 years or until 31 December 2023, which ever first occurs, is an appropriate period to address the disruption and delays to construction caused by Covid-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions. This period not only takes into account the period of restrictions on construction, but also addresses delays and disruptions in logistics, supply chains, and the availability of personnel when restarting construction work after the mandatory and unplanned closure of building sites over the last year. </p></reply>

Section 34 of the Acts provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any tenancy termination notice served. The Table to section 34 sets outs the following valid grounds for the termination of a Part 4 tenancy by a landlord:</p><p>-  the tenant has failed to comply with the obligations (other than the obligation to pay rent) of the tenancy;</p><p>-  the tenant has failed to comply with the obligation to pay rent under the tenancy;</p><p>-  the dwelling is no longer suited to the needs of the occupying household;</p><p>-  the landlord intends to sell the dwelling within the next 9 months;</p><p>-  the landlord requires the dwelling for own or family member occupation;</p><p>-  vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling; and/or</p><p>-  the landlord intends to change the use of the dwelling.</p><p>Under section 34(b), a landlord may terminate a Part 4 tenancy at the end of its  term for a reason other than those listed in the aforementioned Table.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2020 was enacted and came into operation on 24 October 2020 to temporarily modify the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts  to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence to help protect the population from the spread of Covid-19. These tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations. The most recent tenancy protections that applied on foot of a 5km travel restriction covered the period from 31 December 2020 to 22 April 2021. If the Minister for Health makes regulations restricting movement outside a 5 km radius of one's place of residence in the future, the moratorium on evictions will automatically apply in the relevant area during the relevant period.  </p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 introduced permanent protections to provide new procedures to be followed in the context of rent arrears warnings and associated tenancy terminations.</p><p>Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and will be invalid if it is not so copied. A notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can only be served by a landlord on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to both the tenant and the RTB and that the arrears were not paid within 28 days (doubled from 14 days since 1 August 2020) following receipt of the warning by the tenant or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. </p><p>The RTB will acknowledge receipt of any rent arrears warning to the landlord and tenant and provide the tenant with written information to enable them to get advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and on the income and other supports available. If the tenant agrees, the RTB can help them to engage with MABS to resolve their rent arrears and sustain their tenancy. The aim of the new procedures is to ensure that early action is taken to address rent arrears, to the benefit of both the tenant and the landlord.</p><p>Where a tenancy is to be terminated on grounds of rent arrears on foot of Covid-19, enhanced protections and procedures now apply for tenants and landlords under Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (the PDRTA).  The PDRTA provides for temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, that during the period from 11 January 2021 to 12 January 2022 a 90 day (rather than the usual 28 days) termination notice period applies, where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and is at risk of losing their tenancy. The earliest termination date allowed in such circumstances is 13 January 2022. Rent increases are also prohibited for relevant tenancies until 13 January 2022.</p><p>The targeted ban on rent increases under the PDRTA is due to expire on 12 January 2022. The Government will consider what measures, if any, are required after this date to support tenants in financial difficulty due to Covid-19.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board displays comprehensive information on its website - <i>www.rtb.ie</i>- including guidance and frequently asked questions documents relating to terminating tenancies during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

There were 6,003 adults and 2,129 dependants under the age of 18 years in emergency accommodation during the July count week.  The Reports for each month are available on my Department's website at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/80ea8-homelessness-data/</i>.</p><p>Supporting individuals and families facing homelessness is a key Government priority. &lsquo;Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland&rsquo;, the Government&rsquo;s strategic housing plan to 2030, sets out details on how the Government will approach this challenge, and includes a commitment to develop a National Youth Homelessness Strategy by the first quarter of 2022.  Preparing this strategy will involve co-operation and co-ordination between myself and my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Key operational elements in the provision of supports to young people experiencing homelessness, or at risk of homelessness, fall within the responsibility of a range of agencies and stakeholder bodies, and it will be important that their views can form part of the process in developing the Strategy.</p><p>Upon my appointment as Minister, I established a High Level Homelessness Taskforce, to provide a forum for engagement with key organisations working to address homelessness. The Taskforce is also inputting on the implementation of the commitments on homelessness in Housing for All.  The membership of the Taskforce consists of the Chief Executives of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, Crosscare, Depaul, Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, Dublin Simon Community and Threshold. Youth Homelessness is a core concern of the Taskforce and has been discussed at Taskforce meetings, most recently on 26 July, and 1 September, 2021.</p><p>The Youth Homelessness Strategy is being informed by the understanding that supporting young people at risk of becoming homeless through strategic interventions can help avoid a cycle of longer-term homelessness.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-09a.1176.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021090900023#WRV01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 404, 410, 411, 412, 418 and 476 together.</p><p>I briefed the Oireachtas Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs and Defence in detail on this issue on 7 September 2021 and my statement to the Committee is available on the Oireachtas website. In September 2019, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Ms Katherine Zappone T.D., was appointed Special Envoy for Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.  This decision was taken in order to bolster Ireland&rsquo;s profile in the final months of the campaign and underlined the importance attached to our candidature across the whole of Government.  </p><p>During her nine months in this role, then Minister Zappone led twenty-five bilateral meetings during which our candidature was raised, mainly with Ministerial-level representatives of countries in which Ireland does not have resident Embassies.  These meetings took place in the margins of the UN General Assembly in September 2019, at the International Conference on Population and Development in Nairobi in November 2019, and in parallel with official engagements in New York in March 2020.</p><p>The role was additional to the then Minister&rsquo;s existing responsibilities and was not remunerated; as is normal for any person travelling on official business, associated travel expenses were covered. The appointment ended on Ireland&rsquo;s election to the Council in June 2020. </p><p>On 24 February 2021, during a conversation with the then Secretary General of my Department, I asked the Secretary General whether former Minister Zappone could support Ireland's team at the Permanent Mission to the UN in New York.  He advised me that he would reflect on it.  Several days later, the Secretary General informed me that the United States planned to appoint a Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons. In that context, he raised the possibility of exploring whether a similar position for Ireland might add value to the existing work of the Department in this area. </p><p>I approached Ms. Zappone and asked if she would be interested in principle in assuming a position relating to LGBTI rights, should the Department develop such a role. She responded positively, at which point officials in my Department took the process forward.</p><p>The debate on human rights is increasingly polarised internationally and there is debate significant push back against the very definition of human rights and gender equality. Civil society space is shrinking in many countries; and the rights of LGBTI+ persons are being undermined.  As a result, many States that share Ireland&rsquo;s approach to human rights have appointed Special Envoys or Ambassadors at large with mandates in these areas.</p><p>In this context, officials in my Department developed a mandate for a Special Envoy role focused on freedom of opinion and expression, encompassing the human rights of LGBTI+ persons, civil society space, freedom of the media and freedom of association.  </p><p>It was envisaged that the Envoy would engage with peers across the EU and in other countries, and represent Ireland in targeted bilateral engagements and at specific international fora including the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s Third Committee; the Commission on the Status of Women; and the UN Human Rights Council.  It was also expected that the Envoy would support international advocacy initiatives around key events such as World Press Freedom Day; International Women&rsquo;s Day; Pride month; and International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. Supporting international aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy would also have been a key element of the role.  The proposed remuneration was based on the midpoint of the Civil Service Principal Officer pay scale, excluding the two Long Service Increments. </p><p>The proposal to appoint former Minister Zappone as Special Envoy was approved by Government at a meeting of Cabinet on 27 July 2021. Ms Zappone declined the position on 4 August 2021.  </p><p>I can confirm that all records in relation to the appointment of former Minister Zappone as Special Envoy on Freedom of Opinion and Expression that are held by my Department, and by me, have been made publicly available on the Department&rsquo;s website since 6 September 2021.</p><p>I can also confirm that Ms Zappone did not hold any other formal or informal position in my Department during the lifetime of this Government.</p><p>Ireland currently has two Special Envoys. Mr. Tom Arnold is serving as Government Special Envoy on Food Systems, a role which was jointly proposed by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and which is linked to preparations for the UN Food Systems Summit 2021 on 23 September next, and the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit 2021 in December. Mr. Kenneth Thompson is serving as Special Envoy for francophone Africa and the Sahel, a role linked to Ireland&rsquo;s term on the Security Council. </p><p>Finally, I wish to state that my Department had no role in relation to organising or paying for the private event referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

Our Embassy in Washington D.C. continues to reach out to contacts in the US Administration and Department of State on the issue, emphasising the impact of the travel restrictions on citizens in both countries, as well as the economic repercussions. Our Ambassador in Washington has written twice to the US Administration, including in recent weeks, urging them to ease the restrictions. My Department also has a very positive working relationship with the US Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires and her team at the US Embassy in Dublin and we continue to encourage them to process exceptions to their travel restrictions for those travelling to the US for essential reasons. </p>  <p>  At the EU level, following the EU-US summit in June, a joint EU-US Experts&rsquo; Working Group to exchange information and expertise to reinstate safe and sustainable travel between the EU and the United States was set up, and has met twice since then. Due to the Common Travel Area, Ireland has also had a role in the UK-US working group. </p>  <p>  We continue our work to ensure that the restrictions will not have any long-term impact on existing channels of migration, business, tourism and exchange, which benefit our countries significantly.</p></reply>

We take our legal responsibility in relation to Foreign Birth Registration very seriously and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the processing time for these applications stood at 18 months.  This is due to the complex nature of Foreign Birth Registration applications and the very high volume of applications we received due to Brexit. At present, there are just over 31,000 applications in the Foreign Births Registration (FBR) system awaiting processing. </p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 Pandemic FBR application processing was paused to give priority to the provision of other priority services. Notably, we reassigned staff to the HSE for essential contact tracing; to the Department of Social Protection for the processing of essential PUP payments, and to support the Department of Health with quarantine issues. </p>  <p>  These emergency pandemic measures did not impact the provision of passports for essential reasons and we also continued to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, or where an applicant required the return of documents. As with many other areas of public service provision,  a backlog of applications has inevitably grown due to the COVID 19 disruptions of our normal processes.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is very concerned about this backlog situation and are actively planning to resume processing FBR applications as soon as possible. We will be making a public announcement on specific dates in the coming weeks. My  Department is committed to allocating further resources to this service to assist with the high volume of applications when regular processing resumes with a focus on reducing turnaround times to pre COVID-19 levels by the end of 2021.  In the medium term, changes to the FBR process to increase efficiencies and improve the customer experience will be delivered under the next phase of my Department's Passport Reform Programme.</p>  <p>  In cases of exceptional urgency applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly using email address: travelemergency@dfat.ie. </p></reply>

The current turnaround times are 10 working days for Simple Adult renewals, 15 working days for Complex renewals, 40 working days for First Time applications on Passport Online and 8 weeks for Passport Express for applications which have been completed correctly.</p>  <p>  These turnaround times for online applications begins when all required supporting documentation is received by the Passport Service.  For reasons of integrity, the Passport Service is not in a position to process applications that are incomplete.  Such applications will inevitably encounter longer processing times.</p>  <p>  First time applications for adults and children are extremely complex to process to ensure the identity of the applicant, their entitlement to Irish citizenship and, in the case of children, that all guardians have consented to the issuing of the passport. Particular complexity relates to the process of application from children born in Ireland after 2004 due to the need to verify entitlement for Irish citizenship.  </p>  <p>  Customers are encouraged to contact our Customer Service Hub if they require assistance. The Passport Services continues to operate an emergency service for the priority cases. </p></reply>

The Agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.</p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement addressed the constitutional status of Northern Ireland on the basis of the &lsquo;principle of consent&rsquo;. The Agreement recognised the legitimate aspiration to a United Ireland as well as that for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and affirmed the right of self-determination by the people of the island of Ireland, on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South. This was also reflected in changes, by referendum, to the Constitution of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Agreement put in place a framework which is made up of three strands, together representing the relationships that exist within and between the islands of Britain and Ireland. Strand One consists of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive; these institutions are the basis by which political parties in Northern Ireland share power. Strand Two of the agreement saw the North South Ministerial Council established to develop cooperation and action within the island of Ireland, between the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish Government.  Strand Three established the British-Irish Council and British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to promote relations East-West between Ireland and Britain. </p>  <p>  The agreement also looks at issues related to Citizenship; Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity; Decommissioning; Security; Policing and Justice and Prisoners.</p>  <p>  The Peace Process has succeeded over the last two decades in moving definitively beyond the violence of the Troubles. However, it is necessarily an ongoing process, requiring the continued active oversight and involvement of the two Governments as co-guarantors.  Since the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, it has been necessary to pursue a series of successive further political and legal agreements to consolidate the peace settlement provided for in the GFA and to address crises of political confidence in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  In 2005, the Independent Decommissioning Body confirmed that IRA decommissioning had taken place. In 2006, the St. Andrew's Agreement was published, which set out a path to full devolution of policing and justice and a stable power-sharing arrangement. In 2010, the signing of the Hillsborough Agreement allowed for the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly, which then began later that year.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the Stormont House Agreement was reached. The Stormont House Agreement envisaged the establishment of a new institutional framework for dealing with the past. Addressing the difficult legacy of the past remains an ongoing challenge at the core of the Peace Process, and as the Deputy will be aware, a process of intense engagement in currently underway with respect to legacy.</p>  <p>  Following the collapse of the Executive in 2017, there was a three year absence of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement before the New Decade, New Approach agreement was reached and they were restored to operation. The North South Ministerial Council has begun its vital work again, with two plenaries and a range of sectoral meetings now having taken place. The Government is committed to working in support of the full implementation of the NDNA and our own commitments. We also look forward to enhanced roles for the British Irish Council and British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC), as set out in the Programme for Government. A BIIGC took place on 24 June, with the next meeting planned for later this year. The first NDNA Implementation Review meeting took place on 11 January, and a second is planned in the weeks ahead.</p>  <p>  A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is a central provision of the GFA. An Ad-Hoc Assembly Committee has been established, and the Committee published its research paper on the &ldquo;Key Issues for a Bill of Rights&rdquo; in March 2020, and launched a public consultation in May. The Government remains firmly committed to the provision of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  All parties to the GFA recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, which in Northern Ireland includes the Irish language, Ulster-Scots and the languages of the various ethnic communities.  There is now a commitment in place from the British Government to legislate to implement the relevant provisions of the NDNA agreement if the Norther Ireland Assembly has not done so by October.   Progress has also been made regarding the Government&rsquo;s commitments supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland, including the allocation of: &euro;3m as part of the commitment in Budget 2021 for Irish language broadcasting; &euro;1.8m over three years (2020-22) to support the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and an All Island expansion of existing Irish Language Network strategy.  </p>  <p>  The Government continues to support the establishment of a dedicated structure for civic engagement by the Northern Ireland Executive as set out in the Good Friday Agreement under Strand One. In the NDNA agreement, it was agreed that the Compact Civic Advisory Panel would be reformed to propose the most appropriate model for civic engagement on specific issues. </p>  <p>The Government also continues to support the establishment of the North South Consultative Forum, as provided for under Strand Two of the GFA, and has worked to move the issue forward, submitting proposals to the Northern Ireland Executive for its consideration. We have also raised the issue at successive plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.   </p></reply>

In particular I am concerned at the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation, the Taliban&rsquo;s approach to human rights, and to the rights of women and girls and minorities in particular, as well as the need for safe passage out of Afghanistan for foreign nationals and at-risk Afghans.</p>  <p>  I have raised these issues internationally, including at the UN Security Council. At an emergency meeting of the Council on Afghanistan on 16 August, Ireland reiterated earlier calls on the Taliban to end its violent campaign, called for compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law and the protection of civilians, and highlighted the situation of women and girls in Afghanistan. </p>  <p>  Ireland worked intensively with other Council members on the adoption of Security Council Resolution 2593/21 on 30 August. That Resolution strongly condemned the Kabul Airport attacks on 26 August, reaffirmed the importance of human rights, humanitarian assistance, and the need to allow safe passage. Language proposed by Ireland on the importance of ensuring the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in a negotiated political settlement is a key part of that Resolution and its adoption by the Council has sent a clear and united message to the Taliban.  </p>  <p>  I will also be chairing a meeting of the Council on Afghanistan on 9 September. A key issue at that meeting will be the future role of the UN Assistance Mission and how it can contribute to supporting the people of Afghanistan, ensuring humanitarian access, and protecting the rights of Afghan women and girls to education, healthcare, and participation in public life.  </p>  <p>  I also participated in detailed discussions on Afghanistan with EU Foreign Ministers and EU Defence Ministers at our informal meetings in Slovenia on 2-3 September.  EU Ministers agreed that engagement with any future Afghan government will be conditional on criteria including a peaceful and inclusive political settlement and respect for fundamental rights of all Afghans, particularly women and girls, and minorities. EU Council Conclusions outlining this position in more detail are likely to be adopted in the coming week. </p>  <p>  At national level, on 16 August I announced, with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Minister for Justice, that places would be allocated immediately to vulnerable Afghan nationals under the Refugee Protection Programme. Approximately 300 places have since been allocated. Priority has been given to those working on human rights issues, including the rights of women and girls, as well as those working with NGOs, independent media and European and international organisations.</p>  <p>Finally, I have approved the provision of an additional &euro;1 million in humanitarian support to the UN High Commission for Refugees to help the people of Afghanistan and those who have fled to neighbouring countries.   </p></reply>

The ECAT deployed in the early hours of Tuesday 24 August with the support of the French Armed Forces. This was a short-term support to the consular response to the situation in Afghanistan. The goal of the ECAT Mission was to provide consular advice and assistance, including by assisting in the process of safe evacuation. </p>  <p>  The ECAT Mission built on the close cooperation and coordination on the evacuation process through Hamad Karzai International Airport which was ongoing with EU Member States, the UK, the US and other partners. Ten Irish citizens had been successfully evacuated between 17 and 22 August. It became clear however that there were enormous challenges for people to get to the airport safely, and to gain access when there. With the support of ECAT, which operated within the environs of the airport, 26 Irish citizens and residents were successfully supported to evacuate Afghanistan. </p>  <p>There are approximately 70 Irish citizens and dependents still in Afghanistan, the majority of whom, in addition to a number of Afghan citizens with Irish residency, have expressed a desire to leave the country. My Department, and the Embassy of Ireland in Abu Dhabi, continues to provide assistance and advice in that regard.  We are liaising with partners, including those who have a presence on the ground, to explore safe options for exit in the period ahead.    </p></reply>

The Act provides a legal basis for the various policies and procedures that are applied by the Passport Service in the issue of passports.</p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Act provides that a passport will issue in the name of a citizen as it appears on his/her birth certificate or naturalisation certificate. However, a name change for a passport from that which appears on a person&rsquo;s birth certificate is permitted under the Act in situations such as marriage, civil partnership etc. where civil, or legal documents are available to verify this change</p>  <p>  In cases where name change arises, other than by marriage or civil partnership etc, the Act requires evidence of the use of this new name over a two year period. In very sensitive cases there is discretion under the Act for accepting evidence of usage for less than two years.</p>  <p>The question of what a person&rsquo;s name is at any given moment in time depends upon its usage and the evidence to support the constant and sustained use of this new identity.  Evidence of this for at least two years&rsquo; through documentation such as bills/bank statements/official correspondence is required as a deed poll is not adequate evidence of the constant use of a new name.  This policy seeks to protect the integrity and security of the Irish passport and guard against passport or identity fraud.  </p></reply>

This includes working towards secure legal pathways for Irish people to live and work in the US as well as addressing the situation of undocumented Irish. We have continued to raise these matters in our engagement with successive US Administrations, Members of the US Congress, and leaders from across the political spectrum. The Taoiseach raised the matter in March this year while meeting with President Biden during his St. Patrick's Day virtual visit. He also discussed the issue of the E3 visa bill, and of creating pathways to citizenship, with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.</p>  <p>  I am glad to see that immigration issues, including possible pathways to citizenship, are a priority for President Biden, as demonstrated by his proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021. We continue to pursue the E3 Visa Bill, which, if passed, could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities to live and work in the US. Our Embassy in Washington D.C. continues its extensive outreach in support of the Bill, working with a range of Members of the US House of Representatives and the Senate. We will seek the reintroduction of the Bill to Congress at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  We will also continue to actively engage with the Administration as they pursue comprehensive immigration reform in the US. </p></reply>

As required by this Act, all records made or received in the course of the official business of the Department that are not subject to a disposal certificate are retained and then transferred to the National Archives at the 30 year mark, or the 20 year mark in the specific case of records relating to Northern Ireland. My Department has consistently completed the largest transfer of all Government Departments since the first intake of records in 1990. </p>  <p>  The ICT revolution and new technologies over the last 35 years have ushered in transformation in the operations of business and Government, and records keeping policies internationally are evolving to address the substantial challenges. In Ireland, our National Archives Act is clear that it is the content and context of information, and not its format, that determines whether it is a record.  Digital communications becoming the norm for Government work presents real practical difficulties for all Government Departments in terms of the retention, filing and storage of communications that could be of sufficient evidential value to constitute records.</p>  <p>  There is also the important challenge of reconciling the various obligations of cybersecurity, Freedom of Information and Data Protection Acts. The latter Act rightly obliges us to retain no records containing personal data beyond the time required by their limited, lawful purpose.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently undergoing a programme of change similar to other Departments as we are in the process of transforming records management practices and working to introduce a new modern system to meet the demands of our current work practices. These efforts are led by the OGCIO (Office of the Government Chief Information Officer) and include the roll-out of eDocs Records and Document Management platform. My Department will commence its migration to the eDocs platform next year.</p>  <p>In preparation for this, my Department initiated a comprehensive Records Management Reform Project in 2019. This will include an updated Retention Policy and Schedule based on the Guidelines issued by the National Archives in January of this year. It will also look at technical solutions for the efficient transfer and retention of records formed on new electronic technologies. We will incorporate these solutions and other innovations that came from our management response to the Covid-19 pandemic in our future ways of working.  </p></reply>

Ireland supports international efforts to reduce its influence and to strengthen the protection of civilians.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Abuja actively monitors developments in Nigeria and advocates for the protection of human rights, including the free expression of thought, conscience and religion.  Through the Irish Aid programme, Ireland provides humanitarian support those affected by conflict in Nigeria and the wider region. Ireland also provides funding to the Institute for Integrated Transitions, an NGO working in Nigeria, which has assisted in the establishment of an inter-ethnic and inter-religious committee on long term solutions to ethnic, religious, and resource based violence, including conflict between sedentary farmers and nomadic herders.</p>  <p>  Ireland, bilaterally and as a Member State of the EU, works with the Nigerian authorities and with UN partners to promote peace and security in areas affected by armed groups and insecurity, including as an elected member of the UN Security Council.</p>  <p>  As co-penholder on the Security Council file on the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), together with Niger, Ireland&rsquo;s key priority is to support and facilitate UNOWAS in its work on conflict prevention and peacebuilding in West Africa and the Sahel, and promoting democracy and human rights in the region. In its most recent Presidential Statement on this matter, on 17 August 2021, the Security Council strongly condemned continued attacks against civilians in the region, and expressed the need for accountability for human rights violations and abuses. The Council also recognised the adverse effects of climate change on security and stability in the region, and the need for long-term strategies to support stabilisation and build resilience.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Abuja continues to closely follow developments in Nigeria in cooperation with government authorities, civil society organisations, and our EU and UN partners. The Department of Foreign Affairs is committed to continuing to provide much needed support to strengthening peace and security in the region.</p></reply>

In March 2021, Ireland made a national statement at the Human Rights Council, during an Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the DPRK, to raise serious concerns about human rights violations in the country. </p>  <p>  Ireland urged the DPRK Government to take immediate steps to halt all human rights violations, to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s mandate and to fully implement the human rights treaties to which they are party.</p>  <p>  Ireland is fully aware of the recommendation regarding a possible referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC). We recently co-sponsored a resolution at the  Human Rights Council welcoming General Assembly resolution 75/190, which encourages the Security Council to continue consideration of a referral and also condemns in the strongest terms the gross human rights violations committed by the DPRK. </p>  <p>  In February, Ireland signed a joint letter to the President of the UN Security Council, requesting that the agenda item, &lsquo;The situation in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea&rsquo; remain on the list of items of which the Council is seized. This provides a possibility to discuss the DPRK, including human rights issues, at Security Council level. Ireland joined others in repeating this request at a meeting of the Security Council on 25 August. </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called on the DPRK to allow humanitarian access to address assistance needs, both at the Council and 1718 (DPRK) Sanctions Committee levels. Equally, Ireland has supported ongoing expedited humanitarian exemptions by the Committee. </p></reply>

In this role, we are chairing all meetings of the Council and are responsible for managing its agenda. I look forward to bringing Ireland&rsquo;s values and perspectives to this important task.</p>  <p>  The Council Programme of Work for September includes meetings on a range of  issues, including Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and the Middle East Peace Process. Developments in Afghanistan continue to be a high priority and I look forward to chairing a Council discussion on the situation on 9 September. We will also continue to closely monitor the situation in Ethiopia and Myanmar.</p>  <p>  The Presidency provides an important opportunity to highlight a number of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities and we will convene three High Level signature meetings during our Presidency.</p>  <p>  With over sixty years unbroken service, peacekeeping is a longstanding priority for Ireland. On 8 September, Ireland chaired an Open Debate of the Security Council on peacekeeping operations, with a specific focus on transitions from UN peace missions to a reconfigured UN presence designed to sustain peacebuilding gains. Work is underway on a Resolution on this issue, which we hope will be adopted during our Presidency.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will chair a High-Level meeting on Climate and Security on 23 September, during the UN General Assembly High Level Week. The meeting will deepen substantive awareness of how climate security risks are relevant to the work of the Security Council, and explore what tangible actions can be taken.</p>  <p>  Our third signature event will be a High-Level meeting on 27 September to mark the 25th Anniversary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The meeting will enable the Council to mark this important multilateral instrument as part of the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation architecture. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to prioritise the Women, Peace and Security agenda during our Presidency. We are working with Kenya and Mexico, who will hold the Presidency of the Council in October and November respectively, to mainstream the WPS Agenda during this period.</p>  <p>  We will also continue our work to protect human rights, uphold International Humanitarian Law, and promote accountability for violations. </p>  <p>  It is crucial that the Council hears the voices of those affected by its decisions. We will ensure the participation of civil society speakers in Council meetings during our Presidency, with a particular focus on women peacebuilders.</p>  <p>  We will continue to work openly and constructively with all partners, as a solution-oriented member of the Council both during our Presidency and throughout our term on the Council. </p></reply>

We expect that this trend will continue. While, my Department does not currently track the form of the records released under the Act, we have conducted a manual search through our FOI files and found 17 records in the form of text messages or other phone message communications.

To that end, personnel are provided with access to registration forms, through the chain of command. Defence Forces personnel who wish to exercise their right to vote are required to complete a Form RFC annually, to ensure their inclusion on the Postal Voters List. A significant operation then takes place to ensure that those who are registered to vote, at home or overseas, are provided with postal votes, to enable them to exercise their right to vote. </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence provides a link between the Franchise Section of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government (D/HPCLG) and the military authorities. This is to ensure that appropriate timelines for postal voting are agreed. Responsibility for the distribution of postal votes rests with the military authorities. </p>  <p>  On receipt of official notification from the D/HPCLG that an election or referendum has been called, the military authorities inform the GOCs and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service of the pending election. Orders are sent to overseas units indicating that a courier will be dispatched with ballot papers.</p>  <p>  Officers are appointed to collect ballot papers for the various Formations from various post offices. Close liaison is maintained with the Returning Officers from the D/HPCLG regarding dates and timings of collections. On receipt of ballot papers for their personnel, commanding officers check the papers against the nominal roll of personnel who completed their Form RFC. Ballot papers are distributed without delay to personnel concerned. </p>  <p>  The responsibility for returning the vote by post rests with the individual except in the case of personnel overseas, for whom the military authorities arrange for the votes to be returned. This involves the deployment of courier personnel to overseas missions to enable personnel deployed abroad to exercise their vote.</p>  <p>  On retiring or discharging from service, a member of the PDF is removed from the Defence Forces Postal Voters List and the appropriate civilian registration authority is informed to enable the individual to be transferred to the Register of Electors. If a postal ballot is identified by the Defence Forces as being in respect of an individual who has retired or discharged since the Register of Electors was published, then that postal ballot is forwarded to their last known home address.   </p>  <p>  I am assured that the Defence Forces places the highest priority on the thorough, diligent and timely administration of Postal Votes, and will continue to work with both the Local Authorities and the D/HPCLG to ensure that the system operates as efficiently as possible.</p></reply>

Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the <i>Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces</i>(the Gleeson Commission), MSA was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990.This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</p><p>The Final Report of the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions</i>was published in January 2001 and was considered and broadly accepted by the Government.  This Report was the first comprehensive examination of public service occupational pension arrangements since the foundation of the State.  The Commission was an independent body and had invited submissions from interested parties, giving those concerned an unprecedented opportunity to put their case on occupational pension issues.  I understand that groups representative of military pensioners were among those who made submissions and were met by the Commission.  </p><p>In its Report, the Commission specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances (including the MSA) and the consequences for public service pensioners generally.  However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with longstanding public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the Commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned.  Aside from pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the other groups affected include certain retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service and retired teachers.  In the context of the Government&rsquo;s subsequent consideration of the Commission&rsquo;s Report, no change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised or is contemplated.  </p></reply>

The most recent guidance for the education sector was published by the HSE in July 2021 and authored by the Civil Service Chief Medical Officer, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Public Health Medicine in HSE and Medmark Occupational Healthcare.  </p>  <p>  As with all other guidelines around public health measures, my Department has been led by expert medical advice provided by the Government through the HSE and other relevant public bodies. The HSE Guidance for the education sector published in July 2021 represents the latest available advice.</p>  <p>On 30th   June, 2021, where the Occupational Health Service (OHS) i.e. Medmark categorised a teacher or SNA as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; at any time before or during the 2020/21 school year, their &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; expired on that date. For the 2021/22 school year, having considered the HSE advice, the HSE Guidance for the education sector and information available on the OHS website, a teacher or SNA who believes they are at very high risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, must complete the online OHS COVID-19 Risk Assessment Questionnaire and submit it to the OHS.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessments are performed by a team of qualified and experienced specialists in occupational medicine. Available medical evidence, including reports from treating consultants as well as vaccination status of employees, are considered during the OHS COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment process.</p>  <p>  A teacher or SNA who has been categorised by the OHS and considers that the OHS &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; places them in an incorrect risk category, may request a review. The OHS will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided. The teacher or SNA may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. In a situation where the review outcome is that the COVID-19 health risk categorisation remains the same, a further review will only be undertaken, where additional medical evidence indicates there has been a change in the teacher or SNA&rsquo;s medical status or where there is a change in the HSE guidelines for the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group.</p>  <p>  As knowledge of COVID-19 has increased, some medical conditions that previously placed a teacher or SNA in the &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; group now places them in the &lsquo;Normal Risk&rsquo; group. A teacher or SNA in the &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; or Normal Risk&rsquo; group can attend the workplace where the school is implementing the COVID-19 Response Plan and the public health advice for schools. Where a teacher or SNA has been categorised as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; by the OHS, they will be facilitated to work from home.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Response Plan is designed to support employers and employees in putting measures in place that aim to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the school environment. It details the policies and practices necessary for a school to implement the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Work Safely Protocol&rsquo;, so as to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in the school environment.  All employers are required to have an up to date COVID-19 Response Plan in place. The plan outlines the arrangements in place to ensure a safe workplace for all employees. There is an obligation on the employer to discuss the school&rsquo;s COVID-19 Response Plan with employees and ensure that all appropriate risk mitigation measures are clearly in place for their protection.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0042/2021 details the current working arrangements and leave arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic for teachers and SNAs employed in recognised primary and post primary schools.</p></reply>

All employers are required to have an up to date COVID-19 Response Plan in place. The COVID-19 Response Plan details the policies and practices necessary for a school to implement the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Work Safely Protocol&rsquo;, so as to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in the school environment. The plan outlines the arrangements in place to ensure a safe workplace for all employees. There is an obligation on the employer to discuss the school&rsquo;s COVID-19 Response Plan with employees and ensure that all appropriate risk mitigation measures are clearly in place for their protection.  The employer has obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 to ensure the safety and welfare of staff at work. It is the duty of the employer to carry out a risk assessment to meet these obligations, including workplace pregnancy risk assessments.  The employer should also review existing risk assessments to consider any new risks that arise due to the school&rsquo;s COVID-19 Response Plan. </p>  <p>  The evidence available from the operation of schools during COVID-19 to date, shows that schools are low risk environments due to the infection prevention and control measures in place. My Department has been guided by Public Health as to the mitigation measures needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our schools. Public Health has stated that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. The aim of all of the COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures that have been put in place for schools is to support schools to operate safely and prevent the introduction of COVID-19 and also the onward transmission of COVID-19 among the school community. These measures protect pupils, their parents and school staff and are very effective when adhered to. The provision of CO2 monitors for every school will also be an important tool in keeping our schools safe and in addition to the mitigation measures already in place, our staff and students can be confident of returning to safe environments in our schools. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the reopening of schools for the 2021/22 school year, will be carried out in close consultation with Public Health and the Education Partners.</p>  <p>  In February this year, my Department requested that medical specialists thoroughly assess and recommend guidelines for &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; and also pregnant employees working in the education sector. At that time, my Department took a precautionary approach and instructed pregnant teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to work from home, pending the outcome of this review. The most recent guidance for the education sector was published by the HSE in July 2021 and authored by the Civil Service Chief Medical Officer, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Public Health Medicine in HSE and Medmark Occupational Healthcare.  </p>  <p>  In the particular case of advice around pregnant employees, this advice was prepared in consultation with the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the national professional and training body for Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Ireland, as well as other medical and public health professionals.  </p>  <p>  The HSE guidance for the education sector confirm that pregnant teachers and SNAs can safely attend the workplace in school where all the infection prevention and control measures are in place by implementation of the School COVID-19 Response Plan. This is the case whether or not the pregnant teacher or SNA has been vaccinated. However, all pregnant teachers and SNAs should apply to the Occupational Health Service (OHS) before the end of their first trimester, so that their individual medical circumstances can be assessed in the context of COVID-19. Those with underlying medical conditions may be categorised as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; and be facilitated to work remotely i.e. work from home. For a pregnant teacher or SNA, from 14 weeks gestation and categorised as &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; by the OHS who works in a special education setting, she may in certain circumstances be exposed to a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and may be facilitated to work outside of the special education classroom.</p>  <p>  It is of course open to a pregnant teacher or SNA to discuss their individual medical concerns with their own medical team.  Where their treating consultant has concerns over their fitness to work due to a pregnancy-related illness, then the terms and conditions of the Sick Leave Scheme (pregnancy related illness provisions) may apply, outside of the very specific COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment by the OHS referred to above. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessments are performed by a team of qualified and experienced specialists in occupational medicine. Available medical evidence, including reports from treating consultants as well as vaccination status of employees, are considered during the OHS COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment process. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0042/2021 details the current working arrangements and leave arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic for teachers and SNAs employed in recognised primary and post primary schools. </p></reply>

This was done at the end of May and followed on from work done centrally by an expert group that was looking at the role of ventilation in managing Covid-19. </p><p>A copy of the guidance is published at www.gov.ie/en/publication/ad236-guidance-on-ventilation-in-schools/.</p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use.  </p><p>The importance of good ventilation is an important aspect of public health advice on managing Covid-19 risks and this led to the establishment of an Expert Group by the Department of Health.</p><p>A sub-group of the main Expert Group focussed exclusively on the issue of improving and monitoring ventilation in schools. This report formed the based for the most recent updating of the ventilation guidance for schools and included recommendations in relation to strengthening the message about the importance of good ventilation, the use of CO2 monitors and, where considered necessary, air cleaners.</p><p>The use of CO2 monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas/rooms within a building may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with the impact that activities, outdoor weather and window openings have on levels of good ventilation within a room. This information can be used to inform strategies for improving ventilation and in that regard my Department has funded the provision of over 35,000 portable CO2 monitors for schools at an estimated overall cost of circa &euro;4 million. The portable units can facilitate measurements in a wide range of locations in schools.</p><p>Deliveries of CO<sub>2</sub>monitors to schools  commenced in the third week of August  and are expected to be completed by mid-September. In total, it involves over 35,000 CO<sub>2</sub>monitors being distributed to schools in either one or two deliveries over a four-week period.</p></reply>

Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p><p>Policy advice has been requested from the NCSE on the implications of the UNCRPD and this is expected in the coming months.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs. </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS also provides training to schools in programmes to reduce anxiety and promote coping and resilience in children and young people. </p>  <p>  The curriculum plays an important role in teaching students about managing their wellbeing. All students commencing Junior Cycle from September 2017 onwards undertake the area of learning called Wellbeing. Wellbeing crosses the three years of Junior Cycle and builds on substantial work already taking place in schools in support of students&rsquo; wellbeing. When planning a Wellbeing Programme schools should consider the NCCA developed short courses in PE, SPHE, and CSPE. </p>  <p>  In Junior Cycle, six indicators&ndash;Active, Responsible, Connected, Resilient, Respected and Aware&ndash; have been identified as central to students&rsquo; wellbeing. Learning in SPHE provides learning opportunities designed to enhance each of these indicators thereby contributing significantly to the school&rsquo;s Wellbeing programme in Junior Cycle.</p>  <p>  In particular the SPHE short course Strand 4: My Mental Health focuses on building positive mental health, examining young people&rsquo;s experience of mental ill health and learning how to support themselves and others in challenging times. These are the result of widespread consultation with education partners to ensure that the courses address important, relevant and meaningful learning for young people in these subjects. Wellbeing is one of the principles that underpins Junior Cycle education and is reflected in a number of the statements of learning that are central to planning for the student&rsquo;s experience of and the evaluation of the school's Junior Cycle programme.  </p></reply>

Following this, I announced that adjustments would be made to the 2022 examinations which are similar to those published in December 2020 in respect of Leaving Certificate 2021. </p>  <p>  The adjustments are outlined in Assessment Arrangements for Junior and Leaving Certificate 2022, which is available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate. </p>  <p>  These adjustments will leave intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice for students in the examinations.</p>  <p>  The adjustments provide greater choice for candidates across a wide range of subjects. For example, in Leaving Certificate Biology, candidates in 2022 will be required to answer to answer five out of seven short questions in Section A, whereas previously five out of six such questions had to be answered.</p>  <p>  In a smaller number of subjects, e.g. Leaving Certificate Mathematics, Technology and Computer Science, candidates will be required to answer a reduced number of questions on the paper, but no change will be made to the examination duration.</p>  <p>  A summary advice note setting out the key curriculum and assessment arrangements for Leaving Certificate Applied Year 1 and Year 2 students in the 2021/22 school year has also been published and is also available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate. </p>  <p>   The system of Calculated Grades which operated for Leaving Certificate 2020 was intended to be a once-off event in 2020 given the sudden and very challenging position at that time and the impossibility of running examinations in their traditional form safely.  </p>  <p>  A decision was made by Government in February 2021 to offer a system of Accredited Grades to this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate students.  The rationale for this was that, given the levels of disruption to learning experienced by current Leaving Certificate students during two significant and prolonged periods during their Senior Cycle education, it would have been unfair and unjust to require such students to sit traditional Leaving Certificate Examinations without offering an alternative or parallel process.  </p>  <p>  While schools were closed as a result of Covid-19 from January 2021, a programme of remote learning was provided to all students. Students who were in fifth year were also prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students. </p>  <p>  It is hoped that incoming sixth year students will be able to complete a full year of in-school tuition when they return to school at the start of the 2021/22 school year, and will experience no further disruption to their learning as a result of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  It was also announced, on 30 June that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.  The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.    The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice. There will also be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.</p>  <p>  All schools have an additional allocation of Special Education Teaching (SET) hours that are specifically used to support the identified additional and special educational needs of students.  The decisions made by senior management in the use of those hours should be underpinned by the principles laid out in the NEPS Continuum of Support, ensuring that the students with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.   Senior leadership have autonomy to use SET hours in response to both identified and emerging needs of students.  Following these principles schools can make responsive changes in provision for students with special educational needs that incorporate a variety of teaching approaches including, but not restricted to, for example; co-teaching, time bound small group withdrawal and intensive one to one support.  </p>  <p>  The Guidance and SEN departments in schools are also best placed to support students and families in applications for reasonable accommodations during state examinations (RACE).  The RACE scheme is operated by the State Examinations Commission. More information on these supports are outlined on www.examinations.ie. </p></reply>

Caranua's staff commenced working from home on 16th March 2020. The Department understands that Caranua's pre-existing phone, case management and shared drive systems supported the move to remote working. A number of staff already had access to laptops to support attendance at outreach events. Caranua is currently in wind-down.</p><p>Note 2 - The Residential Institutions Review Committee has no employees. </p><p>Note 3 - State Examinations Commission (SEC) - Following the outbreak of COVID 19, which led to the cancellation of the Examinations in 2020 and the introduction of a system of Calculated Grades, the SEC was deemed an essential service. While some remote working was put in place initially there were no additional costs associated with remote working. SEC staff were seconded to the Department of Education to work on the Calculated Grades, these staff continued to work in the SEC, while other staff returned to work in head office in September 2020. SEC head office staff continued to work in the office, with the SEC operating the Leaving Certificate Examinations and the Accredited Grades in 2021. </p><p>Note 4 - Notes in regard to Remote working in Department of Education aegis bodies</p><p>In line with Government guidance staff of the Department's aegis bodies, with the exception of the State Examinations Commission, have been directed to work from home since March 2020. At the time of responding, Government advice was that staff should &quot;continue to work from home where possible&quot;. Aegis bodies are in the process of engaging with staff to address the development of plans in relation to future working arrangements to address remote and hybrid working arrangements within the aegis bodies. As Caranua closed its executive office in March 2021, the issue of requests for hybrid or remote working does not arise.</p><p>Note 5 - The State Examinations Commission has advised that the nature of the work of the SEC does not lend itself to remote working, except in the case of certain specialised posts.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be  processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Department's website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any pupils attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisation representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required, or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it, they should indemnify the school.</p>  <p>  My Department cannot direct any member of the Board of Management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment to pupils, action and procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses. </p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of pupils for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school, when appointing an SNA. </p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally.</p></reply>

Dublin 9 is partly within each of the Whitehall_SantryD9, Beaumont_CoolockD5 and Drumcondra_Marino_D1 school planning areas.</p>  <p>  The most recent projections for all three school planning areas indicate increasing requirements at post primary level.  My Department is currently working to examine the capacity of the schools in the area to meet this projected demand. </p>  <p>  A number of capital projects have been recently completed or are currently planned or underway in the Dublin 9 area, including expansions at St. Aidan&rsquo;s CBS, Dominican College, Clonturk College and Scoil Caitriona.  Furthermore, a new post primary school was announced to be established to serve the Drumcondra_Marino_D1 school planning area.

These measures protect pupils, their parents and school staff and are very effective when adhered to.</p>  <p>  Current public health advice makes it a requirement for a face mask to be worn by teachers, staff in schools and students attending post-primary school. </p>  <p>  The HPSC keeps infection prevention and control measures under review on an ongoing basis. The advice regarding face masks has not changed for the new school year.</p>  <p>  The Department is also working with the HSE Testing Pathways Working Group which is examining the use of antigen testing in education settings. The approach to antigen testing in education settings, including in schools will be informed by the pilots currently underway in childcare and third level.</p>  <p>   The Department will continue to work with the group as it is considered important that any data collected from the pilot of antigen testing within the wider education sector is available to inform decisions on the appropriateness of more widespread deployment of such tests within the schools sector and the potential to scale to the sector.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to engage regularly with public health officials in respect of the safe operation of schools during Covid-19.</p></reply>

Subsequently the school submitted another ASA application for the provision of 2 special classes and associated accommodation and this application is currently being assessed. </p>  <p>  In relation to the school&rsquo;s application for a GP Room, as the Deputy is aware, the main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on the provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics. The second half of the NDP (from 2023 onwards) will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock. This will include a PE Hall/GP Room build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all schools have appropriate facilities to support PE provision.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Departments website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

By its nature, it is intended to be a short term intervention.</p><p>The scheme provides a compensatory educational service for</p><p>- Children with special  educational needs seeking an educational placement in a recognised school  </p><p>- Students, enrolled in  schools, with significant medical conditions which has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, major disruption to their attendance at school </p><p>- The scheme also provides Home Tuition for pre-school/early educational intervention for children with autism who meet the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility criteria. </p><p>Where a child is attending an early intervention or private pre-school setting, the home tuition hours allocated will be the difference between the hours approved in the pre-school or early intervention setting and the maximum home tuition hours for which the child would normally be eligible under the terms of this scheme.</p><p>Under the Scheme, in certain cases and where appropriate having regard to the criteria, the Home Tuition Grant may be extended until the end of July.</p><p>As tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.  Accordingly, it is a condition of the scheme that parents/legal guardians recruit a tutor who is qualified in the sector in which tuition is being provided, and is registered with the Teaching Council for the duration of the approved tuition, up to and including issue of final payment. </p><p>Where all efforts have failed to secure the services of a teacher qualified to teach in the sector concerned, the Department may consider the engagement of a person who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications) in a relevant area, e.g. Psychology.</p><p>In line with policy advice received from the NCSE, a review of the July Provision programme was commenced in 2019. This review process was paused due to the impact of COVID-19, during which the summer education programme was significantly enhanced and expanded to take into account the effect of school closures over 2020 and 2021.  The review of the programme will recommence at the earliest possible stage.</p></reply>

Teachers registered with conditions are generally given 3 years in which to satisfy the conditions. If a teacher fails to satisfy the condition within that period of time, they may request an extension of time. Section 32(1)b of the Acts states that it is at the discretion of the Council to grant an extension to that period of time. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all teachers are aware of the expiry date of their conditions, the Council issues a number of notices by email/SMS/letter to the teacher. In total an average of seven communications are issued starting 4 months in advance of the expiration date. This is to allow the teacher time to provide the necessary evidence or extension request with the required supporting documentation. </p>  <p>  The Council processes all extension requests in the context of the Procedures &ndash; Extension Request Assessments as published on the website. The Registration Panel on behalf of the Council consider the extension requests and supporting documentation on a case by case basis. Where the extension of time is refused the teacher is offered the opportunity to have the decision reviewed by the Registration Review Group and should submit a request for a review within 21 days of receiving the original decision. </p>  <p>  If a teacher has not met the conditions of registration and fails to submit an extension request to the Council, they lapse from the Register of Teachers in line with Section 32(2) of the Acts. The criteria is applied equally to all registrants and as such it is important to ensure all applicants are subject to the same procedures. </p>  <p>  The person referred to by the Deputy should continue to liaise directly with the Teaching Council and follow their guidance in order to meet the criteria to obtain full registration.</p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation Grant to cater for day to day running costs such as heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, general up-keep etc. and the Ancillary Services Grant/School Services Support Fund (SSSF) to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff.

However, there are a number of exceptions where my Department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a specific and urgent need.

The curriculum specification and prescribed syllabus materials are determined by the NCCA and it is the responsibility of each individual school to select the resources that it will use to support its implementation of the curriculum. With respect to the specific issue raised, it should be noted that the specification for Junior Cycle CSPE does not contain any reference to or mention of greyhound racing. </p>  <p>  The knowledge and skills that students are expected to gain across all curriculum areas are published in subject specifications on www.curriculumonline.ie.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA does not advise upon the content of specific text books. Nor does the NCCA review or provide feedback on textbooks or have any role in endorsing or approving textbooks. There are no written guidelines setting out this relationship between the NCCA and educational publishers. It is a matter for publishers and their editing processes to ensure their textbooks are fit for purpose in a competitive market and for schools to choose which, if any, of these textbooks they believe will support the teaching of the curriculum. It remains open to those with concerns to contact schools directly using the information publically available on my department&rsquo;s website. www.education.ie/en/find-a-school </p>  <p>  My Department does not review or approve the content of textbooks published by private companies, as this may be seen as an indication of approval for their use in schools.

The Expert Group recommended that the report be read in conjunction with advice issued by the Department of Education Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools. The Expert Sub Group report formed the basis for the most recent updating of the ventilation guidance for schools and included recommendations in relation to strengthening the message about the importance of good ventilation, the use of CO2 monitors and, where considered necessary, air cleaners. To support schools further to identify rooms which may have inadequate ventilation and to optimise comfort levels through a better understanding of the degree of window opening required in rooms, the Department have arranged for the provision to schools of a number of portable units (based on the size of each school). The use of CO2 monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas/rooms within a building may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with the impact that activities, outdoor weather and window openings have on levels of good ventilation within a room. This information can be used to inform strategies for improving ventilation and in that regard my Department has funded the provision of over 35,000 portable CO2 monitors for schools at an estimated overall cost of circa &euro;4 million. The portable units can facilitate measurements in a wide range of locations in schools.</p><p>The use of CO2 monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas/rooms within a building may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with the impact that activities, outdoor weather and window openings have on levels of good ventilation within a room.

These portable units can facilitate measurements in a wide range of locations in schools.</p><p>Deliveries of CO<sub>2</sub>monitors to schools commenced during  the 3<sup>rd</sup>week of August and are expected to be completed by mid-September. In total, it involves over 35,000 CO<sub>2</sub>monitors being distributed to schools in either one or two deliveries over a four-week period.  </p><p>The number of units provided by county is determined by the size and number of schools in each location. The bandings below have been used to allocate the monitors. <table>    <tr>       <th>Primary Schools (Classrooms)</th>       <th>Monitors per school</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 classroom</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 to 4 Classrooms</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 to 8</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>9 to 12</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>13 to 16 </td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17 to 20</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>21 to 24</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>25 to 30</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>31+</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Schools</td>       <td>Monitors per school</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Schools</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secondary Schools (Free Scheme)   enrolment bands</td>       <td>Monitors per school</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;500</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>501 to 750</td>       <td>25</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>751 to 1000</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1001+</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As of the 7<sup>th</sup>of September 16,500 monitors have been delivered. </p><p>CO2 levels provide a guide on air quality.  Monitoring CO2 levels will help schools to identify poorly ventilated rooms. The CO2 monitors being provided to schools guides them on the need to increase ventilation once Co2 levels are above 800 CO2 parts per million. </p><p>The updated guidance on ventilation references a role for air cleaners in certain more limited circumstances where for example a room is not well ventilated and works are awaited to address same.  The air cleaner can assist in such cases in improving air quality but it is important to note that air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation. </p><p>A school&rsquo;s architect or engineer can guide a school on whether an air cleaner is necessary or appropriate. </p><p>If an individual school has particular difficulties in managing ventilation my Department is available to guide and support it as required on the appropriate strategy to address same.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s ventilation guidance for schools is very clear and practical on the steps to be taken by all schools to manage ventilation levels. A copy of the guidance is published at www.gov.ie/en/publication/ad236-guidance-on-ventilation-in-schools/.</p></reply>

In the 2020/2021 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020. </p>  <p>   All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time for the 2021/22 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.

This includes the recommendations from Public Health that post-primary services would operate at 50% capacity and that masks would be worn. All other measures relating to hygiene, pre-assigned seating, cleaning and the wearing of masks by post-primary students are also in place.  Funding is being provided by my Department for the additional buses required so that services can operate at 50% capacity and for the cost of the other required measures. </p>  <p>  As the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services is rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeds, the capacity limit of 50% on post-primary school transport services will be subject to ongoing review and the Department will be considering the position in this regard over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>Should post-primary services resume operating at 100% capacity and  where additional vehicles that were provided for social distancing purposes are removed, any spare capacity available will be offered on those services to concessionary pupils or late applicants where such capacity exists.  </p></reply>

The group was originally established to consider contingency arrangements for the 2020 Leaving Certificate and was reconstituted for the purposes of planning for the 2021 Leaving Certificate. The group includes representatives of students (Irish Second Level Students Union), parents (National Parents Councils), teachers (TUI and ASTI), school leadership and management bodies, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p>  <p>  In meetings held in April and May, this group discussed the Leaving Certificate 2022 examinations. </p>  <p>  On 30 June, the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations received an update in relation to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. </p>  <p>  Following this meeting, I announced that adjustments would be made to the 2022 examinations which are similar to those published in December 2020 in respect of Leaving Certificate 2021. </p>  <p>  The adjustments are outlined in Assessment Arrangements for Junior and Leaving Certificate 2022, which is available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate. </p>  <p>  These adjustments will leave intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice for students in the examinations.</p>  <p>  The adjustments provide greater choice for candidates across a wide range of subjects.</p>  <p>  A summary advice note setting out the key curriculum and assessment arrangements for Leaving Certificate Applied Year 1 and Year 2 students in the 2021/22 school year has also been published and is also available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate. </p>  <p>   The system of Calculated Grades which operated for Leaving Certificate 2020 was intended to be a once-off event in 2020 given the sudden and very challenging position at that time and the impossibility of running examinations in their traditional form safely.  </p>  <p>  A decision was made by Government in February 2021 to offer a system of Accredited Grades to this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate students.  The rationale for this was that, given the levels of disruption to learning experienced by current Leaving Certificate students during two significant and prolonged periods during their Senior Cycle education, it would have been unfair and unjust to require such students to sit traditional Leaving Certificate Examinations without offering an alternative or parallel process.  </p>  <p>  While schools were closed as a result of Covid-19 from January 2021, a programme of remote learning was provided to all students. Students who were in fifth year were also prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students. </p>  <p>  It is hoped that incoming sixth year students will be able to complete a full year of in-school tuition when they return to school at the start of the 2021/22 school year, and will experience no further disruption to their learning as a result of Covid-19</p>  <p>It was also announced, on 30 June that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.  The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.    The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice. There will also be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.  </p></reply>

A feasibility report has been carried out by the Department&rsquo;s Design Team, presenting two options to address the issue. However, these options have been rejected by the neighbouring property owner. Their proposal is that a new boiler should be installed on its property and that the Department of Education should pay the full cost of this.  </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that while my Department is willing to make reasonable accommodations in respect of the vent, my Department does not accept that it should carry the full cost of a new boiler house for the neighbour. </p><p>The Design Team is currently working on the completion of the Stage 2(b) report, for the school building project, which upon completion will be submitted to the Department for review.</p><p>My Department issued correspondence to the neighbour via their solicitor outlining that the proposal for a new boiler house is not acceptable as it goes much further than dealing with the issue of the air vent and requesting that they revert to the Department by 10<sup>th</sup>September with proposals in respect of vent issue only, which the Department will ask its Design Team to review and if necessary convene a meeting.  In tandem my Department asked the School&rsquo;s design team to also explore any other options in respect of the vent. The neighbour has recently reverted in correspondence via their solicitor seeking a meeting between both parties Design Teams to endeavour to find a workable solution. My Department is liaising with the School's Design Team to arrange this meeting in the near future. </p><p>The school building project has been delayed by both the right of way and the resolution of the vent issues. My Department has been in continuous engagement with the neighbouring property with a view to progressing the school building project. As the Deputy will appreciate the school building project will provide a new 16 Classroom School  and my Department is committed to progressing this project as quickly as possible.  </p></reply>

This has been done in partnership many organisations including my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority and the Higher Education Authority. As part of this, the RSA has developed a range of material that teachers can use to educate school children about road safety as it applies to all road users &ndash; pedestrians, motorcyclists, cyclists and motorists. The resources are tailored to each user group. These are available on their website </p><p>In addition, while at post-primary level, there are no plans to introduce mandatory driver education classes, basic tuition to lay a foundation in driver education is featured on many school curricula already. </p><p>In relation to 16-18 year olds, there are opportunities built into the programmes for students to engage with the content of the driver theory test. For example, the 'Your road to safety' - Transition Year programme, consists of a 45-hour version and a 20-hour fast-track option. The programme provides important educational material and learning on road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and motorists. It covers such issues as seatbelts and airbags, driver fatigue, drink/drug driving, road-safety engineering and enforcement, basic first aid at road crashes, emergency services and rehabilitation, licensing and insurance issues, the NCT, purchasing a car and driving abroad.  The programme does not include driving lessons. However, relevant driver theory test content is included at the end of each module.</p></reply>

Supports provided would be based on children's individual needs, irrespective of the cause of those needs. </p><p>Where supports under my Department&rsquo;s various schemes were refused due to ineligibility, funding has in certain cases been provided by the HSE. As acknowledged at the time, this led to some delays in the provision of supports. Therefore, in conjunction with the HSE, my Department reviewed the procedures involved where the schools of children identified by this review wish to apply for supports, in order to establish if there was a more efficient way of making provision. </p><p>On foot of this review, and as an exceptional measure, the provision of certain special educational needs supports outside the terms of my Department&rsquo;s schemes was approved. In July 2020, the parents and the schools involved were informed of this. </p><p>Where the school wishes to apply for assistive technology for these pupils, it should do so in the usual way, i.e. by submitting the relevant application form to the local SENO or Visiting Teacher. Applications received will be reviewed as a matter of priority, and the SENO will provide my Department with a recommendation as early as possible. </p><p>Where the SENO recommends that the application meets the criteria, funding will be provided to the school through the assistive technology scheme, as normal. </p><p>Where the application does not meet the criteria however, and it is established that the equipment in question has not already been funded either by my Department or the HSE, then funding may be provided by my Department, outside of the terms of the scheme. </p><p>The equipment for which funding may be provided is as follows: </p><p>- Laptops </p><p>- Tablet computers</p><p>- Soundfield systems </p><p>- Radio Aids </p><p>The schools in question were advised that if they had previously applied for equipment under the Assistive Technology scheme, had the application refused and if the equipment was not subsequently funded by the HSE, the school should write directly to the Special Education Section of my Department, with a copy of the refusal letter, and request a review of the previously refused application. </p><p>The schools should only submit applications where the specific equipment is recommended in a professional report and the school&rsquo;s view is that it is essential for the pupil&rsquo;s education. </p><p>Funding for chair silencers (or &ldquo;Chair Sox&rdquo;) is not provided under any of my Department&rsquo;s schemes. If silencers are required however, and have not been separately funded by the HSE, then the school may apply to my Department for funding towards their purchase. The application for funding can be made in writing, and a quotation should be attached to same.  </p><p>I wish to again confirm to the Deputy the assurances which have previously been made in respect of additional teaching support.  Since the introduction of the Special Education Teaching allocation model in 2017, it is open to these schools to engage with my Department on the level of support required for these pupils.</p></reply>

Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p><p>Policy advice has been requested from the NCSE on the implications of the UNCRPD and this is expected in the coming months. </p></reply>

In this regard, any concern or allegation of a child protection nature received by staff in my Department is dealt with in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Procedures for responding to Child Protection Concerns which come to the attention of staff employed by the Department of Education.  </p><p>My Department does not make any judgment on the concerns which comes to its attention and ensures that the details of the concern reported to the Department, including reports which relate to historical abuse, are immediately passed on to the relevant authorities, i.e. Tusla-the Child and Family Agency, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or the school authorities as appropriate. My Department is aware of the matter raised in the media article provided by the Deputy. My Department has no powers to investigate child protection concerns.</p><p>When contacted by individuals in relation to historical abuse, as well as reporting the details to the authorities in line with the Department&rsquo;s procedures, my Department provides details of counselling supports available.  As part of the State's response to individuals experiencing distress as a result of childhood sexual abuse, a free National Counselling Service was set up which is run by the HSE and has been operating since 2000.  Full details are available on </p><p>In addition, my Department recently announced a revised ex gratia scheme to provide those, who had, by 1 July 2021,  issued legal proceedings against the State in respect of day school sexual abuse with an opportunity to apply for an ex gratia payment.

A fundamental principle of the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017 is that all schools must keep pupils/students safe from harm while attending the school or while participating in school activities. </p></reply>

This guidance is focused on the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection, including physical distancing measures and reducing the risk of congregation of students. It is a matter for each individual school to implement these measures locally taking into account its individual circumstances such as school layout.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that positive action has been taken by many schools on the issue of heavy school bags. Actions consist of a range of measures, including the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</p>  <p>  The use of digital resources by teachers and students in schools is increasing. While conventional textbooks are still widely used, a number of schools have introduced or are considering introducing e-books and other digital resources to enhance students' work in school and at home. Schools can use the book grant scheme to purchase a range of digital resources relevant to the curriculum. </p>  <p>  It should be also be noted that Scoilnet.ie, the Department funded website, supports Primary and Post-Primary teachers in sharing and finding useful resources for the classroom, including the World Books online encyclopedia resource, and other valuable online content and resources to assist in teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  Ultimately it is a matter for each individual school to determine which particular measures are most suited to its individual circumstances as to how the school concerned organises teaching and learning at this time. </p></reply>

In the 2020/21 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8kms at post-primary and are attending their nearest School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time will be accommodated on school transport services for the 2021/22 school year where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and may be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated.   Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the pupils referred to by the Deputy are not attending their closest post primary centre, and are therefore not eligible for transport under the terms of the scheme. Bus &Eacute;ireann has also advised that there is currently no service with spare capacity for the pupils to avail of for the current school year.  Payment for the pupils in question was received 25/06/2021 for the 21/22 school year and a refund will be issued in due course. </p>  <p>  In cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance the pupil resides from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language.  If a family has further information in regard to the closest school being full they should contact School Transport Section of my Department. Further information in this regard is available on my Department's website www.education.ie.  </p>  <p>  Such requests are considered on a case by case basis following  documentary evidence being submitted by the family, including but not limited to:</p>  <p>  - The detailed steps taken to enrol the pupil in the nearest and next nearest schools.</p>  <p>  - Evidence that an application for enrolment was made within the deadline dates specified by the school.</p>  <p>  - A letter from the School Authorities confirming that the school was full at time of enrolment. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-09a.1681.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021090900032#WREE03200"><p>Firstly, I wish to reassure the Deputy that my Department takes child protection very seriously and considers that the protection and welfare of children is a fundamental responsibility of all involved in the care and education of children. Any concern or allegation of a child protection nature, received by staff in my Department is dealt with in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Procedures for responding to Child Protection Concerns which come to the attention of staff employed by the Department of Education.  </p><p>My Department has no powers to investigate child protection concerns. Under these procedures the Department does not make any judgment on the concerns which comes to its attention and ensures that the details of the concern reported to the Department are immediately passed on to the relevant authorities, i.e. Tusla-the Child and Family Agency and/or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate. My Department cannot guarantee confidentiality to complainants in such circumstances as the information received must be passed on to the relevant authorities for investigation, including any details of the person reporting the concern.</p><p>In that regard, details provided by the Deputy with this question have been passed to Tusla.  <b></b></p><p>The issuing, by my Department of revised Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools in 2017 brought with it an extensive programme of professional development for teachers and school leaders. A fundamental principle of the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017 is that all schools must keep pupils/students safe from harm while attending the school or while participating in school activities. </p><p>My Department plays an important role in the oversight of the child protection procedures for schools. The Inspectorate carries out a range of inspections in all recognised schools. Schools are selected for inclusion in the broader inspection programme using a range of factors and information. Although the Inspectorate has no role in the investigation of individual complaints about schools, all correspondence is noted and it may, together with a range of other information, be considered by the Inspectorate in planning its inspection programme. The Inspectorate does not comment on its future planned inspection programme.</p><p>The child protection procedures for primary and post primary schools outline the obligations placed on boards of management, as employers, where an allegation of abuse is made against a member of school personnel. Chapter 7 of the procedures provides specific guidance to schools in relation to the reporting procedures for the concern as well as the protocols in relation to dealing with the employee. In a school context, the most important consideration to be taken into account is the protection of children, and their safety and well-being must be the priority. Each school authority also has a duty and responsibility, as an employer, in respect of its employees.  </p><p>Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provides that the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers is the responsibility of boards of management of recognised schools or, where the employer is a person other than a board, by that person. My Department does not have the legal powers to instruct a school to follow a particular course of action regarding individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints. However, procedures have been agreed between management and unions and have been published by my Department to assist Boards of Management/Schools. </p><p>In relation to how a parent might pursue a complaint to a school, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, my Department, does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases.  My Department's role is to clarify for parents and students how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. </p><p>Where it is felt that there is cause for complaint, matters would normally be addressed to the individual teacher or school Principal as appropriate.  If matters cannot be resolved at that level then a complaint can be addressed to the school&rsquo;s Board of Management.  Where a school has a formal complaints procedure in place this should be followed in pursuing any complaint.</p><p>In addition responsibility for bullying in schools falls to the level of the individual school.  Each school has an Anti-Bullying Policy and Code of Behaviour (or similar titles) and these are ordinarily accessible on the schools website or should be available from the school.</p><p>Where a parent is of the view that a school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, it is open to the parent to raise the matter with the Ombudsman for Children. The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised by my Department, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions or non-actions of a school has, or, may have, adversely affected the child.  </p><p>The Teaching Council of Ireland also has power to investigate a complaint about a teacher and to conduct fitness to teach inquiries.  Any person, including a member of the public, an employer or teacher may make a complaint about a registered teacher.The Teaching Council has a complaints facility that can be accessed in appropriate cases. Details are available on their website at </p><p>Further details on complaints can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at  </p><p>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/9bf5d3-inclusive-education/#child-protection-and-safeguarding.</p></reply>

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels. </p><p>The Department will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion, or over 20% of its total educational budget on making additional provision for children with special educational needs in 2021.</p><p>This represents an increase of over 50% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided. </p><p>Budget 2021 provided for an additional 990 additional SNAs for allocation to schools, bringing the total numbers to 18,000 by December 2021.</p><p>This allocation of SNAs is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2021 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>This will represent an increase of increase of 70% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.</p><p>Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews. The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>The question will be referred to the NCSE for their direct reply.  </p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p>  <p>  A copy of the guidance is published at www.gov.ie/en/publication/ad236-guidance-on-ventilation-in-schools/. </p>  <p>  The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p>  <p>  The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO2) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. </p>  <p>  My Department procured portable monitors that are being distributed to schools in August and September &ndash; between 2 and 20 at primary school level and between 20 and 35 at post-primary school level depending on school size, at an estimated overall cost of &euro;4 million. This will ensure that a CO2 monitor will be available for use in every classroom in Ireland. The monitors are portable, simple to use, and will give a digital reading. </p>  <p>  Deliveries of CO2 monitors to schools commenced in the third week of August and are expected to be completed by mid-September. In total, it involves over 35,000 CO2 monitors being distributed to, primary and post-primary schools. The target remains to have all monitors delivered by the middle of September.</p>  <p>Smaller sized schools will receive their full allocation in one delivery, with medium and larger sized schools receiving two deliveries. This approach maximises the number of schools that are provided with monitors as early as possible.    </p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p><p>A copy of the guidance is published at .</p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO2) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. </p><p>The Department procured a number of portable monitors that are being distributed to schools in August and September &ndash; between 2 and 20 at primary level and between 20 and 35 at post-primary level depending on school size at an estimated overall cost of &euro;4 million. This will ensure that a CO2 monitor will be available for use in every classroom in Ireland. The monitors are portable, simple to use, and will give a digital reading. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school.</p><p>Deliveries of CO2 monitors to schools commenced in the third week of August and are expected to be completed by mid-September. In total, it involves over 35,000 CO2 monitors being distributed to , primary and post-primary schools in the Free Scheme and schools approved on the basis of their application in the Fee Charging sector.</p><p>Smaller sized schools will receive their full allocation in one delivery, with medium and larger sized schools receiving two deliveries. This approach maximises the number of schools that are provided with monitors as early as possible.</p><p>The target remains to have all monitors delivered by the middle of September.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>-vExisting mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website </p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020  are available on the Departments website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes.</p><p>The staffing schedule which now stands at a new historical low will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.  </p><p>As part of the supports provided under The Roadmap for the Full Return to School in 2020, specific funding was provided to support Principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools.  This funding provided each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week.  Schools have been advised that, in the context of COVID-19, the additional allocation of Principal Release Days outlined in Circular 45/2020, &quot;COVID-19 Operational Supports for the Full Return to School&quot; will remain in place for the 2021/22 school year and each school with a teaching principal will have 37 Principal Release Days. </p><p>In total 1700 additional leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools since the lifting of the moratorium on posts of responsibility in 2017, which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  The Department has committed to annually revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year which ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system. The most recent update for the current school year is available on the Department's website (Circular 0025/2021). This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p><p>The Substitute Teacher Supply Panel was expanded last year, from a pilot scheme consisting of 6 base schools to 132 Substitute Teacher Supply Panels nationwide, with almost 380 newly appointed Supply Panel teachers employed, providing substitute cover to over 2,500 schools across the country.  Primary schools have been informed that the Supply Panel Scheme will continue for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>I understand the need for improved capitation funding and I am pleased that Budget 2020 has been able to provide for a further 2.5% increase in standard capitation funding for primary schools that applied from the start of the 2020/21 school year. This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in Budget 2019.</p><p>The combined increases given in 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration will be achieved. </p><p>All schools have received the benefit of the capitation increases awarded to date. It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets.</p></reply>

My Department is conscious of the need to have supports in place at the time that the customer needs them and to be able to respond rapidly to changes in the labour market and the demand for services.</p>  <p>  The procurement process was preceded by extensive engagement both at Ministerial and official level  and all stakeholders were given the opportunity to share their views and suggestions on the Department's plans to procure quality employment services in an open and competitive manner. At my instruction Departmental officials are continuing to engage with the relevant stakeholders including the ILDN, non ILDN service providers and employee representatives. </p>  <p>  Phase one of the process, involving the procurement of a Regional Employment Service for four lots over seven counties in the Midlands and North-East - areas currently without a local employment service - is at an advanced stage. Phase two will follow in due course with the aim of having services in place for early 2022.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring my Department incorporates the lessons learned in the first phase of procurement and engages once more with a broad range of stakeholders prior to the commencement of the phase 2 procurement. Any learnings from phase 1 will be incorporated into phase 2 to ensure there are no barriers to the participation of the community and voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the legal requirement to hold competitive tenders for future employment services remains and the procurement model will update decades-old contracts in line with procurement regulations.</p>  <p>  The design of the request for tender for the Regional Employment Service, places significant value on an organisations ability to deliver a wide range of services locally through a range of other service providers and has been developed to ensure it is accessible to tenders from the community and voluntary sector, giving due regard to their experience and competencies.</p></reply>

The current disability quota for the Department of Social Protection, The Pension Authority and Citizens Information Board is 3%. It is the intention of each body to achieve or maintain a target of 6% by 2024.

The Department has a dedicated Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) which has recently been incorporated into the newly formed HR Equality Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion Unit (ED&amp;amp;I).  The DLO provides supports to people with disabilities including arranging for workplace adaptions to both existing employees and new entrants.  In addition to this, the ED&amp;amp;I Unit regularly organise awareness and educational events such as webinars accessible to all Department staff.</p><p>Disability is an integral part of the Department&rsquo;s Equality, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion policy.  This is highlighted, in the context of the Departments commitment to the employment of individuals with disabilities, on the Departments public website. Under the Department&rsquo;s employee 'Engagement and Innovation' initiative, a dedicated working group was set up in 2020 in the area of &lsquo;Supports for Staff with Disabilities in DSP&rsquo;.  In accordance with the structure of this employee engagement programme, this collaborative group is represented across the grades in the Department, from trade unions, policy areas and staff with disabilities. </p><p>Recruitment for the Department is conducted by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  PAS are committed to ensuring that all competitions held are accessible to individuals who require adaptions or adjustments.  The Department annually participates in the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) Programme and the Department's HR area are currently in the process of exploring participation in the Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) Programme, which may increase the Department's direct recruitment of individuals with disabilities and provide access to development and employment opportunities within DSP.</p><p><b>Citizens Information Board</b></p><p>The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is committed to the ongoing improvement of services to people with disabilities. Robust policies and procedures are in place within CIB to ensure current staff with a disability are supported with all supports, which are reasonably expected to be provided by the employer.  Since 2019 CIB has extended the reach of all job vacancy advertising involving 13 local and national services working with minority groups including those specifically working with people with disabilities.  Every new vacancy is distributed to these agencies with a dedicated point of contact named should they wish to be provided with more detail.  Wording on all recruitment advertising and materials has been expanded highlighting CIB not only as an equal opportunities employer but spelling out how it encourages applications from all candidates regardless of race, colour, disability, marital status, family status, gender, religion, sexual orientation, membership of travelling community. </p><p>CIB have also developed a new Diversity and Inclusion Policy, highlighting to all staff CIB&rsquo;s commitment to everyone employed by CIB.  Flexi time arrangements have been put in place for staff with disabilities who find it difficult to travel to and from work during peak times, Occupational Health services and  employee assistance services are utilised to support any of our staff with disabilities.</p><p>All current employees have attended dedicated workshops on dignity at work.  Staff who sit on interview panels have had upskilling on interview techniques in advance for interviews and CIB are currently in the planning stage of an organisation-wide rollout of workshops on Disability Awareness.  As part of CIB&rsquo;s Corporate Social Responsibility programme each quarter of the year is dedicated to raising awareness of supports for all staff, October to December 2021 has already been confirmed as the quarter that is dedicated to raising awareness of people with disabilities in line with December being Disability awareness month.</p><p><b>The Pensions Authority</b></p><p>The Pensions Authority is supportive of both applications to vacancies from candidates who may have disabilities and employment of individuals who may have disabilities.  Furthermore, the Pensions Authority implements reasonable adjustments for current employees where they are identified/requested or if an applicant to a vacancy requires one e.g., a sign language interpreter during the interview process.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The Fuel Allowance is an important measure that assists pensioners and other welfare dependent householders to address income deficiency, especially during the winter when a household faces increased heating needs.  The duration of the scheme is designed to coincide with the coldest periods of the year and it is for this reason the scheme runs from October to mid-April. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government targeted one third of carbon tax revenues to go towards boosting the incomes of the poorest in our society.  Based on ESRI research, three key DSP payments were targeted for increases in the budget as a result - the Fuel Allowance, the Qualified Child Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance.  Accordingly, with effect from January 2021, I increased the Fuel Allowance by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28 for a period of 28 weeks.</p>  <p>  While I fully understand that these are difficult times for many people, especially for the vulnerable and the elderly, any further economic measures, such as extending the 2020/21 fuel allowance season for some customers, can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.  </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme, a Heating Supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs.  If a recipient of a social welfare payment has exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income, that person may apply for a Heating Supplement.  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  Heating Supplements are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A central policy framework for Blended Working in the Civil Service will be finalised in conjunction with employee representatives over the coming months.  This framework will inform the development of organization-level blended working policies tailored to the specific requirements of each Department/Office, whilst ensuring a consistency of approach across key policy areas.  In conjunction with this framework an application process is also currently being developed to allow staff to apply for blended working into the future.</p><p>As an essential service, staff in my Department have continued, throughout the pandemic, to work both on site in office premises and remotely to deliver for our customers.  The number of staff who are working remotely at any one time is approximately 3,300 or 50% of the total staffing number and has remained relatively constant through the Covid-19 restrictions. </p><p>To support remote working my Department has put in place a health and safety self-assessment system with the necessary training, furniture and IT equipment being provided as a result of these assessments. </p><p>The additional costs generated to date, relating to furniture and accommodation for remote workers during the Covid-19 pandemic are approximately &euro;107,000.</p><p>In relation to the costs regarding IT equipment, my Department has an overall capital allocation from which it procures all computer related hardware such as desktop computers and laptops including for remote working purposes.  It is not possible to separate out the expenditure of laptops and ancillary equipment specifically for remote working purposes from the overall computer hardware expenditure which includes all hardware procured under normal business as usual arrangements.  Furthermore, my Department does not make a contribution to wi-fi or personal phone costs incurred by staff.<i></i>In accordance with FOI legislation with effect from January 2016, details of public contracts awarded over &euro;25,000 are published quarterly on www.gov.ie.</p><p>The Departments HR Wellbeing Unit has developed and offered a range of online supports to staff and managers working remotely in the areas of personal and professional wellbeing.  In addition, my Department's HR area have also provided supports, advice and training materials in relation to managing staff remotely and managing newly appointed staff through their probation whilst working remotely.</p><p>The position in relation to the relevant bodies under the aegis of my Department is as follows:</p><p>1. Citizens Information Board (CIB)</p><p>All CIB staff members are currently working remotely. CIB has committed to developing a remote working policy in line with central arrangements. </p><p>33 laptops were provided to CIB staff at a cost of &euro;52,800. 35 mobile phones were provided to CIB staff at a cost of &euro;14,427 between March 2020 and August 2021.  Miscellaneous equipment was also provided to CIB staff (eg monitors, keyboards) at a cost of &euro;3,584.50.  CIB does not pay contributions towards wi-fi costs for staff working at home.</p><p>As CIB does not have a long-term remote working policy at present, no applications for permanent remote working have been received.</p><p>2. Pensions Authority</p><p>All Pensions Authority employees continue to work from home pending further guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding a return to the office.</p><p>Where required, employees return to the office to undertake essential IT, administration and facilities management work.  The Pensions Authority is currently developing its longer-term remote working policy and procedures in line with DPER guidance as it becomes available.  No employees have applied to work from home permanently or from a hybrid model yet.</p><p>During 2020, 22 new employees joined the Authority.  The Authority expenditure incurred across the organisation in dealing with the impact of Covid 19 was approximately &euro;100k.  Most of the increased costs relate to provide the ICT and general supports for employees required to work remotely.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 1,005,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit. </p>  <p>  While I am aware of the campaign by Epilepsy Ireland, extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to a person with any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and, accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.  </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

To date expenditure on the scheme is over &euro;8.6 billion. </p>  <p>  Since the gradual lifting of restrictions and the continuing progress on Covid-19 vaccinations, the number of recipients on PUP has fallen by over 70% from a peak of 481,000 in February to just over 143,000 last week.  It is important therefore in the interests of equity and sustainability to restore standard social welfare terms. </p>  <p>  To allow as much time as possible for the economy to re-open and for employments to recover, the Government agreed to taper the payment of PUP and withdraw it slowly over a prolonged period between September 2021 and February 2022 to align it with the standard jobseekers payments.</p>  <p>  From September the maximum rate of PUP of &euro;350 will reduce to &euro;300, the current rate of &euro;300 will reduce to &euro;250 and the rate of &euro;250 will reduce to &euro;203.  These new payment rates will take effect in payments made on 14th September.  Two further phases of rate changes are scheduled to take place from 16th November 2021 and 8th February 2022. </p>  <p>  The Government also agreed that PUP customers currently in receipt of the &euro;203 rate of payment would  transition to standard Jobseeker terms commencing in September. The commencement  of this process has been deferred until the end of September rather than from early September, as planned. This is in response to the publication, on 31st August,  of the Government's Roadmap "Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting". </p>  <p>  The Deputies may be aware that in general working age payments including jobseekers payments are not payable with other weekly social welfare payments. However, given the unprecedented circumstances of Covid-19, provision was made for PUP to be paid with certain other specified social welfare payments, including Carer's payments.  PUP recipients in receipt of concurrent weekly payments will also be contacted directly during the transition period and their position will be regularised in line with standard social welfare terms.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position for the Deputies at this time.</p></reply>

The estimated cost for daily expenses allowance in the first 4 months in the Reception and Integration centre to my Department is &euro;3.7m.  These costings have been developed based on the assumption that the new model needs to have capacity to meet the needs of 3,500 applicants per year, of whom one-third will be children.</p><p>In Phase 2, applicants will move out of the Reception and Integration Centres to accommodation in the community.  While it is envisaged that my Department will provide a payment channel for the new International Protection Payments on behalf of Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, it is that Department which will retain the policy and budget for the payments.

This includes time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the challenges caused by the Covid-19 public health restrictions and the adverse impact on a number of rural and urban CE schemes in recruiting new CE participants. My Department supported CE schemes since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, by ensuring that contingency measures were in place to support CE schemes.  </p>  <p>  This included the extension of CE participant contracts that were due to end during the periods of restrictions. The measures introduced helped to mitigate recruitment challenges for CE schemes while supporting the ongoing delivery of important community services throughout the period.  I and my Department are very aware of the need to continue to support CE schemes during the current recovery period. </p>  <p>  One of the measures included in the Pathways to Work Strategy announced by Government in July, 2021 was an increase in the capacity of the Public Employment Service in Intreo Offices and contracted services to further support jobseekers through the provision of job search advice and assistance.  This increased capacity will support persons who jobs are permanently lost due to COVID as well as those unemployed pre-pandemic.  These additional resources will be central to meeting the increased demand for services, given the impact of the pandemic on employment and will support the increased demand for new candidate referrals to fill existing and new CE vacancies.   In this regard, I would encourage CE projects to remain in close contact with the Department's Community Development Officers.</p>  <p>  Under Pathways to Work, the Government announced 3,000 additional places on Employment Support Schemes, including Community Employment.  Of the additional places, 1,475 places have recently been assigned to existing CE schemes.  These new places  will be available to existing and more recent long term unemployed persons, including those whose employment was adversely affected as a result of Covid-19. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of both the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities throughout the country, while ensuring that these placements are available for the current cohort of long term unemployed.</p></reply>

As such, the yearly average, and banded payments, were used to calculate the rate of payment - otherwise people would have had to wait and contribute for a considerable number of years to achieve a reasonable pension payment in retirement.  The yearly average mechanism is set out in detail as part of the Operational Guidelines for State Pension Contributory published on the Department's web site at .</p><p>A policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010.  In January 2018 the Government agreed to a proposal that allowed pensioners affected by the September 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which would include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.  This approach significantly benefited many people, particularly women, whose work history included an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  The interim TCA ensured that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - would determine their final pension outcome.</p><p>Those who reached state pension age after September 2012 had their pension entitlement reviewed under the interim TCA method with 56% of women reviewed receiving an increase while 24% of men reviewed also received an increase.  Those who have reached state pension age since January 2018 have had their pension entitlement assessed under yearly averaging and the interim TCA with the most beneficial payment being awarded to them.</p><p>As part of the Programme for Government, a Commission on Pensions was set up to look at sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  More broadly, it has also been considering the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and how the pension system can further accommodate carers, who are predominantly women.  The Commission will set out options for the Government to address issues such as qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements.  The Commission formally submitted its report to me earlier this week. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

If, for example, eligibility for the scheme involves a means assessment, then information and data necessary to assess means will be sought. This might include details of earnings and/or income from employment or self-employment, or details of assets such as capital or property. </p><p>My Department has a Customer Charter in place which sets out what a customer should expect when they contact, or are contacted by, the Department.  Inspectors operate under a code of practice which sets out the manner in which they are required to deal with customers.  The code requires that<b></b>customers must at all times be treated equally, fairly, with respect and dignity, as outlined in the Customer Charter.  </p><p>As regards the information sought by the Deputy on the number of home visits carried out by social welfare inspectors in 2020 by county, it is not possible to provide this as this information is not collated by the Department.  Where appropriate, details of home visits by Social Welfare Inspectors may be included in individual case reports.  Statistical information is not available from this source.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Under the Act, the National Disability Authority (NDA) has the statutory role to report, on an annual basis, on compliance with the 3% target.  </p>  <p>  The Disability Act 2005 defines disability as follows:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Disability, in relation to a person, means a substantial restriction in the capacity of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015 - 2024 the Government has committed to increasing the public service employment target  for persons with disabilities on an incremental basis from a minimum of 3% to a minimum of 6% by 2024.</p>  <p>In order to report on this target my Department asks every employee, whether or not they have any disability, to complete a census form and return it, in confidence and on a voluntary basis, to the nominated person in the HR Unit.  Based on these returns, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth reported a total of 5.33% of staff in the Department who had declared a disability as at the 31st December 2020.</p>  <p>  While this Department uses the Public Service Appointments to recruit new staff,  the Department also participates in the Willing, Able and Mentoring (WAM) Programme which offers 6 month placements at EO level to graduates with disabilities. While the Association of Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) runs this programme, it works with PAS in identifying suitable candidates for this programme.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth acts as the monitoring committee for the collection of this data from the National Disability Authority,  the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) and  Oberstown Children Detention Campus (Oberstown). With the exception of Oberstown, these agencies all exceeded the 3% target. Oberstown was just under the target, having focussed its recruitment throughout 2020 on a particular area of frontline staff - Residential Social Care Workers. However, while Oberstown did not meet the statutory minimum for 2020, it did provide 4 work experience placements for people with disabilities through out the year which were not counted as part of their overall percentage return at end of 2020.</p>  <p>  As independent bodies, the Ombudsman for Children's Office and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report directly to the Department of Expenditure and Reform with their statistical returns on employees with a disability.  </p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007.  </p>  <p>  Our approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation, each year moving forward on key reforms, with the obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments. </p>  <p>  One of the key pieces of legislation to be progressed is the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 which is the responsibility of my Department and a commitment under the Programme for Government.  </p>  <p>  This is a very important piece of legislation that changes the existing law on capacity from the status approach of the wardship system to a flexible functional approach, whereby capacity is assessed on an issue and time-specific basis.  It will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. We are working towards a date of June 2022 for full commencement.  </p>  <p>  Amendments are required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place.  Work is actively taking place on an Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which is expected to be published by year-end and enacted early next year.  The amendments will streamline processes, in the interests of those using its provisions.  They will also strengthen the safeguards included in the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill is also being used to advance a number of other legislative provisions required by the UNCRPD.  These provisions were previously contained in the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which lapsed with the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il, and include measures such as the role to be played by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the National Disability Authority in monitoring the implementation of the UNCRPD.  </p></reply>

However, my Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review. It will have regard to income support measures available to foster families generally.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge foster carers as the backbone of child care services. Foster care is the preferred option in Ireland for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians. Approximately 92% of children in care are looked after by foster carers. More than one quarter of these children are placed with relative foster carers.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week per child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week per child aged 12 years and over. This payment was protected during recent economic hardships and is tax-free. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes.</p>  <p>  Foster carers also receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. It is important that foster carers have access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p></reply>

Amendments are also required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place. </p>  <p>  Work is actively taking place on an Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which is expected to be published before year-end and enacted early next year.  The amendments will streamline processes, in the interests of those using its provisions.  They will also strengthen the safeguards included in the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  Some provisions of the Act have been commenced to enable; the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service; the establishment of a multidisciplinary working group in relation to Advance Healthcare Directives; and most recently, on the 1st of February this year, the repeal of the Marriage of Lunatics Act, which means that a ward can now marry if she or he has capacity to do so. </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service has made considerable progress in putting in place the administrative and IT systems needed to operate the 2015 Act.  To this end a budget of &euro;5.8 million was secured for the Decision Support Service for 2021, a significant increase on its &euro;3.5 million 2020 budget.</p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, meets monthly to oversee and drive progress towards full commencement.  The Steering Group comprises senior officials from the Department of Health, the Department of Justice, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service, the HSE, and the Decision Support Service, recognising that successful operation of the 2015 Act will involve multiple stakeholders.  They are working towards commencement of the 2015 Act in June 2022, with the Decision Support Service opening for business immediately thereafter.</p></reply>

The definition of relevant parent under the Act includes a parent of the child and the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a parent of the child.</p>  <p>  The intention of parent&rsquo;s leave is to enable parents to spend time with their child in the earliest years and is deliberately non-transferrable between parents to ensure that both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to spend time with their child.  This is further supported through the provision of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit, which is paid at an equivalent rate to maternity, paternity and adoptive benefits at &euro;245 per week.  It is open to employers to top up payments.  There is no barrier preventing them from doing so.</p>  <p>  It is important that the provision of family leaves meet the needs of working parents and families and my Department is monitoring the uptake of family leaves and will examine the need for further actions, as required.</p></reply>

Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).</p>  <p>  Targeted supports (Levels 4-7):</p>  <p>  - Level 4 addresses the needs of early learning and care practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early learning and care (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs.</p>  <p>  - Level 5 recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or that some early learning and care settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some minor capital building works.</p>  <p>  - Level 6 provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable a child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  - Level 7: Additional assistance in the pre-school room involves additional capitation for service providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports at Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. Funding can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or reduce the staff / child ratio, supporting the pre-school leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.</p>  <p>  In total, 15,509 children have so far benefitted from targeted AIM supports since AIM began in 2016. </p>  <p>  The total AIM budget for 2021 is &euro;48m.  However, in 2020, the number of approvals for additional assistance under Level 7 of AIM fell to 2,868, compared to the previous year of 4,657 due to service providers availing instead of Covid-19 financial support through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and we expect the expenditure in 2021 also to be lower than budgeted because of the EWSS.  </p>  <p>  AIM Level 1 spending is based on the number of INCOs, with the payment calculated on the basis of children in the ECCE programme supported by the INCO, at a rate of &euro;2 additional capitation per child per week. Expenditure on Level 1 for the pre-school year 2020/21 was &euro;5.6m.</p>  <p>  AIM Level 5 expenditure on equipment and minor alterations was approximately &euro;500,000 over the pre-school year 2020/21. During this time, 222 children were supported, with average spending per child of &euro;2,251.</p>  <p>  AIM Level 7 expenditure during the pre-school year was &euro;15.8m, averaging a cost per child in relation to whom additional assistance was approved of &euro;5,543. This figure is based on either &euro;210 per week to enable a service to supplement their staffing by 15 hours per week, or &euro;140 to supplement their staffing by 10 additional staff hours per week. AIM Level 7 additional capitation can also be approved on a pro rata basis where there is a clear justification for doing so (e.g. the child cannot attend the service on a full-time basis or other supports are available on a part-time basis). </p>  <p>  Other levels of AIM, such as training for practitioners, are not calculated on a per-child basis.</p></reply>

It entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies. </p>  <p>  The universal subsidy is available to all families with children aged between 24 weeks and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the Early Childhood Care and Education programme if later). The universal subsidy is based on the child&rsquo;s age, and not on income. Parents do not have to undergo an assessment to avail of this subsidy. </p>  <p>  The universal subsidy currently provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place up to a maximum of 45 hours a week. The current cost of this subsidy is &euro;22.50 per week, which costs &euro;11 million per year. Doubling this would amount to &euro;45 per week which in turn, would equate to an annual cost of &euro;23 million. </p>  <p>  As the universal subsidy is underpinned by age, an increase in payment does not increase eligibility. There are currently 11,000 children on universal. The cost modelling reflects a maximum universal participation rate of approximately 15,800. Increases to the value of universal payments may add 3-400 children to this number based on increased incentives to avail of the higher subsidy.</p></reply>

As of the end of August 2021, there were 1,185 persons who have been granted status and currently reside in accommodation centres provided by my Department.</p>  <p>  Significant work is undertaken to support these residents in moving out of accommodation centres and into secure accommodation in the community. My Department has a specific team in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) who work in collaboration with a number of stakeholders to collectively support residents with status, or a permission to remain, to access housing options.</p>  <p>  Stakeholders include; Depaul Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust (PMVT), the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the City and County Managers Association.</p>  <p>  All residents who are successful with their application to the Minister for Justice for a protection status or a permission to remain, are notified by letter by IPAS of the supports available to them and of the contact details of their support workers. These services are funded by my Department. Contact details for housing support workers are also posted in each accommodation centre and are readily available from the centre managers.  </p>  <p>  On a continuous basis a number of clinics (which provide information on housing options) are held for persons with a form of status. The clinics are held in accommodation centres with both IPAS staff and Depaul/PMVT support workers.</p>  <p>  While the supports mentioned here are made available to all residents who have been granted a status, it is always open to them and any other residents to make their own arrangements for accommodation at any time, if they so wish, and many do so.  </p></reply>

Their work in relation to retrospective cases, reported to them, offers support to survivors and ensures there is no current risk to other children. </p>  <p>  The cases of abuse, in Belvedere College in the 1970's, have been brought to my attention. Tusla confirm that no referrals were made at any time in respect of either of the two teachers as 'Persons Subject to Allegations of Abuse' (PSAA). Both individuals are deceased. Tusla cannot assess cases where PSAAs are deceased as there is no &lsquo;current risk to children&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The Jesuit Society of Ireland recently published the PSAA names and encouraged former students who may have suffered abuse to come forward. Subsequently, other referrals (arising out of the publication of PSAA names) have been made to Tusla by the Jesuit Society. Where cases meet the threshold for assessment, they are dealt with under Tusla&rsquo;s 2014 Policy and Procedures for Responding to Allegations of Abuse and Neglect and if sought Tusla advises and directs people towards appropriate counselling services. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Jesuit Society is currently conducting an enquiry into the allegations of sexual abuse by the former teachers at the school. The Society has appointed a Child Safeguarding Manager in the Jesuit Safeguarding Office as a confidential contact for anyone with information in relation to these or other cases of abuse.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Order's apology and current actions to address these matters. I encourage any person who has experienced abuse, or has reason to believe that a child is at risk of abuse, to speak to Tusla, or the Garda&iacute;. </p></reply>

My Department is supportive of HSE proposals to expand these pilot studies to further locations in the coming period.  Institutions not currently involved have expressed their interest and there may be scope for clusters of institutions to participate within the same region.  A site selection process is under way and will conclude shortly.</p></reply>

Upskilling and reskilling are a key Government priority to foster an inclusive recovery and to support the digital and green transitions, key commitments in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Lifelong learning lies at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s and the EU&rsquo;s education and training policy and is acknowledged as being vital for sustainable economic growth, the restoration of employment, and fostering social cohesion.  This recognition of the importance of lifelong learning is reflected in the targets set both nationally and at EU level for lifelong learning participation. Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy set a lifelong learning target of 10% to be reached by the year 2020 and 15% by 2025.  In quarter 4 2020, approximately 302,300 adults aged 25-64 years had engaged in lifelong learning, representing a lifelong learning participation rate of 11.6%, this was a reduction on prior year&rsquo;s attainment caused by COVID-19 related measures.   </p>  <p>  Further Education and Training (FET) is primarily delivered or contracted by the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs), under the funding and strategic direction of SOLAS. FET offers a diverse range of programmes and supports designed to meet the needs of individuals at different stages of the learning pathway. Courses focused on foundation or transversal skills development, including literacy, numeracy and digital skills, build the core capabilities that allow participants to move on to more advanced learning opportunities with the aim of enabling every citizen to participate fully in society across their lifetime.</p>  <p>  The new FET Strategy 2020-2024 recognises the key role that FET must play in helping to address the digital divide and provide learners with the core ICT skills to address digital literacy and commits to enhancing technology within FET to ensure that better use is made of digital technology for teaching and learning. There are a range of programmes available within FET for all persons who wish to develop their digital literacy. These programmes are integrated into adult literacy and numeracy provision and are designed to meet the specific digital literacy needs of learners. As a result, they are generally organised on a one-to-one or small group basis. </p>  <p>  A &euro;225m investment package was announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan, which includes a significant skills package for upskilling and reskilling aimed at equipping workers whose jobs are unlikely to return, including a focus on digital skills transition and a new Green Skills Action programme at further education level.  A research and innovation National Grand Challenges Programme has also been launched which will focus on the need for a transition to a climate neutral and clean economy as well as the challenges of digital transition.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 launched on 19th April last sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. The actions set out in the plan seek to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025. </p>  <p>  Government is committed under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship to working with employers to promote, enable and support the recruitment of apprentices.  Measures to support employer engagement in apprenticeship across all sectors of the economy, particularly within the SME sector, will be integral to the delivery of the target of 10,000 new apprentice registrations per annum by 2025.  These measures encompass both financial and non-financial and will include an annual grant for employers not benefiting from the existing mechanism of State-funded craft apprentice training allowances for off-the-job training. This employer grant will be administered by the new National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) and the level of grant will be announced by year end. </p>  <p>  Green skills are the heart of the Government&rsquo;s post-Covid recovery and regeneration plans. Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB) and retrofit programmes are currently provided in Waterford Wexford ETB, Laois Offaly ETB and Mount Lucas National Construction Training Centre with work ongoing to establish a further three centres of excellence in Cork, Limerick Clare and Mayo Sligo Leitrim ETBs. </p>  <p>  At higher education level, in addition to core full time and part time programmes, funding is also provided under Springboard and the Human Capital Initiative for programmes which support the development of green skills, including professionals in areas such as Building Analysis and Climate Adaptation; Sustainable Building Technology and Retrofit, Conservation and Sustainability.   </p>  <p>  Additional demand for skills to support the transformation to Low Carbon Economy are being identified through the ongoing EGFSN study &lsquo;Skills for the Low Carbon Economy&rsquo; which is due to be finalised in the coming period.</p></reply>

This applies to people who are dependent on different types of social protection payment.</p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been treated as reckonable income since it was introduced in March 2020. Income from the Covid-19 payment therefore has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance. </p>  <p>  A very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed based on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.</p>  <p>  An applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing support@susi.ie. </p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy cannot be provided in the format required.  When SUSI assesses an applicant&rsquo;s reckonable income, the totality of the income is examined. If the total income is found to exceed the income thresholds outlined in the legislation, the applicant is deemed ineligible due to their total income exceeding the income thresholds. </p>  <p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment is only one component of an applicant&rsquo;s total reckonable income and it is not possible for SUSI to determine which component of the income results in the total income exceeding the threshold.    </p></reply>

All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  However, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.</p>  <p>  An applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing support@susi.ie. </p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19. I am confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.</p>  <p>  Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

This sector offers a range of different programmes and offerings to both EU/EEA and non-EU/EEA learners who travel to the State to study English. My Department does not collect the data requested in respect of this sector. </p><p>As Irish society becomes increasingly diverse, developing English language skills is becoming increasingly vital in enabling non-English speaking migrants and their families to fully participate in all spheres of Irish life. While many migrants coming to Ireland are well educated and skilled, there is also a significant number of migrants with lower standards of education who require English Language tuition.</p><p>In the further education and training (FET) sector, all 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) offer free English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) classes, as part of their Adult Literacy provision, to meet the day-to-day social, cultural and work-related language needs of new community members. Priority is given to unemployed migrants, international protection applicants and refugees with limited or no English language skills.</p><p>ESOL Literacy classes are also provided to assist people with no formal education in their home country or who don&rsquo;t have basic literacy skills. These classes can be provided on either 1:1 or small group basis. All applicants are required to complete an initial assessment before starting class to ensure that all learners are provided with classes at the correct level. </p><p>Figures for 2020 indicated that planned beneficiaries for ESOL provision were 20,317. While figures did decline in 2020, no doubt as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, they remained relatively high at 16,274.

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases.  The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course. </p>  <p>  In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner:- </p>  <p>  - Craft apprentices were prioritised for a return to on-site learning on 8 March 2021.  </p>  <p>  - Delivery of off-the-job phases continued over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach assisted institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.  </p>  <p>  - &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This will facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand. </p>  <p>  - An additional &euro;12 million was allocated for 2021 to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures at higher education level (Phases 4 and 6). </p>  <p>  - A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is well developed. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time.</p>  <p>  - Phase 2 apprentice commence off-the-job training throughout the year. SOLAS are engaging with the ETBs to maximise and expand provision to clear the waiting lists for phase 2 training.</p>  <p>  - Phase 4 and 6 intakes are currently scheduled three time per year &ndash; September, January and April.  Additional capacity coming on stream at phase 4 and 6 from September has resulted with in the region of 2,500 phase 4 and 6 apprentices scheduled to commence off-the-job training in September, up from 2,100 per intake immediately pre-COVID. </p>  <p>  - In the event that Phase 4 and 6 are prevented from returning at full capacity, a number of alternatives remain available to ensure that craft apprentices are not precluded from qualifying in a timely manner, including the potential for competency assessments to allow apprentices to qualify.

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases.  The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. The minimum duration of each craft apprenticeship is four years, or 208 weeks. Attachment 2 details each craft apprenticeship and the minimum duration required to meet the standard.  The current average duration of each programme is being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy once available.</p><p>Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course. </p><p>In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner:- </p><p>- Craft apprentices were prioritised for a return to on-site learning on 8 March 2021. </p><p>- Delivery of off-the-job phases continued over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach assisted institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.  </p><p>- &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This will facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places across the system in the coming period and into the future.  </p><p>- An additional &euro;12 million was allocated for 2021 to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures at higher education level (Phases 4 and 6). </p><p>- A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is well developed. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time. </p><p>National annual capacity for the three off-the-job training phases has been impacted as a result of lockdowns and the closure of on-site training over the last number of months. The data attached in attachment 1 is based on the following assumptions:<ol type="1"><li>2019 data is based on off-the-job phases which started on or after 1/1/2019 and finished before 1/1/2020. As such, courses which started in 2018 and finished in 2020 are excluded.  The capacity total is based on the number of places allocated to each craft apprenticeship across phases 2/4/6.</li><li>2021 COVID data is based on off-the-job phases which started on or after 1/1/2021 and have a planned finish date before 1/1/2022. As such, it includes completed phases, those currently being scheduled and courses which are ongoing as at 7th September. </li><li>2021 non-COVID data (Column D) is an estimation. For phases 4 and 6 this is based on 2019 figures plus additional capacity coming on stream from September, the 2021 schedule has been used for phase 2.</li></ol></p></reply>

Where there are concerns in relation to compliance with the requirements of the Government&rsquo;s 'Work Safely' protocol that cannot be resolved through the processes set out in the sectoral protocols, they may be brought to the attention of the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority (HSA) utilising its complaints procedures - www.hsa.ie/eng/customer_service/make_a_complaint/. </p>  <p>  This initial resumption of in-person activity is a key stepping stone on the pathway to recovery for the ELE sector in Ireland. With the recent publication of COVID-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting, which sets out Ireland&rsquo;s plan for the next and final phase of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and which will see the broader reopening of Irish society, my Department will have further engagements with the ELE sector as it develops plans for its own wider reopening, including for the resumption of the recruitment of new international students in line with public health guidelines, relevant travel restrictions and advices, and in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s published roadmap.</p></reply>

The majority of institutions have made plans for large-scale on site learning in 2021. Large lecture theatres, in particular, will be actively managed, either through applying percentage occupancy limits, setting a maximum class size, an upper limit on lecture length/ period of continuous occupancy or otherwise, depending on local context and risk assessment. These variations are in line with the autonomy given to the HEIs in the Plan to make decisions on the return to campus in line with their own infrastructure and institutional contexts.</p>  <p>  The sector has now commenced to move from planning into the implementation phase with the realisation on the 6th September, of the commencement of the return of this sector to significant on-site teaching, learning and research in a number of centres including 6 higher education campuses.</p></reply>

Higher and further education and training, and research are considered to be essential activities and extensive planning has been undertaken to enable the academic term 2021/22 to take place mainly on-site for all students, learners, and staff.  </p><p>As part of this planning, the Department has worked closely with the higher education sector and student representative bodies to develop a protocol with key principles of assurance to ensure that the arrival of international higher education students for the coming academic year is managed safely and in line with public health requirements. This protocol includes all up-to-date public health measures and, in addition, details other arrangements such as familiarisation training for all these students in advance of their arrival. The protocol includes assurances from the Higher Education sector that students who arrive will be transported from the airport directly to suitable accommodation to allow them to adhere to the prevailing public health requirements regarding self-quarantine.</p><p>My Department has also been working closely with English language education (ELE) stakeholders over the course of the pandemic to date via the Covid-19 Working Group established for this sector. Following the publication of COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery: The Path Ahead last June, extensive planning was undertaken by sectoral stakeholders within this Working Group to enable the safe resumption of limited, small group, in-person provision to cater for the needs of this sector&rsquo;s existing cohort of students i.e. those currently in the State. On the basis of these plans and subject to the conditions of the notice published by my Department (), limited, in-person activity could begin to resume within this sector from 19th July 2021 where it is safe to do so. This initial resumption of in-person activity is a key stepping stone on the pathway to recovery for the ELE sector in Ireland. </p><p>With the recent publication of COVID-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting, which sets out Ireland&rsquo;s plan for the next and final phase of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and which will see the broader reopening of Irish society, my Department is having further engagements with the ELE sector. An update will be provided to the sector shortly.</p></reply>

In total, we received over 110 submissions in the public consultation from a range of stakeholders. In late June, the Department held an online stakeholder event where a wide range of stakeholders from across Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;I system came together to discuss the issues raised in the consultation paper and inform the strategy. A number of further meetings with key stakeholders have begun and will continue to run into autumn of this year. </p>  <p>  Development is ongoing, but it is the intention that the next strategy will set a vision and ambition for Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;I system that all relevant actors will identify with and contribute to, with ambitious national strategic goals and objectives out to 2027. Successive action-led Work Programmes will map out specific deliverables over shorter timescales. This will enable agility and responsiveness over the full period of the strategy and a strong focus on delivery and reform.</p>  <p>  I intend on bringing the strategy to Government for approval and subsequent publication later this year.</p></reply>

The Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. </p>  <p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance. In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person concerned would have to show that an easement existed, i.e., whether an easement of light or otherwise, and that there had been a substantial interference with that right.</p>  <p>  Mediation on such issues should be considered in the first instance. While the Mediation Act 2017 does not deal directly with the issue of overhanging trees, it does seek to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings. This Act contributes to the resolution of disputes by means of mediation, thereby reducing legal costs associated with such disputes and avoiding the stress involved in adversarial court proceedings.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 which relates to Public Service Employment does not apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as per their Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement &amp;amp; Action Plan 2020-2021 are committed to developing a Code of Practice for the employment of people with disabilities to support better employment outcomes for people with disabilities in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   </p>  <p>  An Equality Policy is in place in my Department, and we are currently in the process of developing an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) strategy.  </p>  <p>  Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 provides for a statutory report on the employment of people with disabilities in the public sector, which is submitted to the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This report is compiled by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, using information provided by all public bodies staffed by civil servants, and gives details of the number of people with a disability employed in the Civil Service. The 2020 report indicated that 138 out of 2,729 Department of Justice employees, or 5.1%, reported having a disability. This exceeds the current 3% target of employment of persons with disabilities set in the Disability Act 2005.  </p>  <p>  As my Department relies on the Public Appointments Service to assign the majority of its staff, the Department is limited in its ability to increase the percentage of staff who have a disability. However, the Department is delighted to take part in the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme every year. WAM is an initiative of the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD), which offers a paid mentored work experience placement to graduates with disabilities. So far this year, two graduates with disabilities have undertaken WAM placements in the Department. In addition, a previous WAM participant now occupies a permanent role in the Department, having been successful in a PAS competition and subsequently promoted in an internal competition. </p>  <p>  Candidates who have disabilities are provided with the necessary additional accommodations and supports at every stage of the recruitment process, including at shortlisting and interview. Candidates are invited to indicate any accessibility supports they may need as part of the communication surrounding a recruitment competition.</p></reply>

As outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, it is intended that a General Scheme of a Defamation (Amendment) Bill will be prepared by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  As a measure of the Government's commitment to this reform, the Defamation (Amendment) Bill, to implement the resulting legislative changes, is already included in the Government&rsquo;s updated Legislation Programme, which was published in January 2021.</p>  <p>  It is a priority for me and my Department to get the reform of defamation law right, and to bring forward the required legislation at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  In advance of completion of the review of the Defamation Act 2009, Schedule 1 of the 2009 Act was amended by the Part 20 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the amendments was to ensure that post-Brexit, fair and accurate reporting of certain statements, meetings and press conferences held in the UK continue to be protected against claims of defamation, by the defence of qualified privilege, in exactly the same manner as it was prior to Brexit. The need for the amendments arose because several provisions in the 2009 Act, as enacted, regarding the &lsquo;qualified privilege&rsquo; defence, applied to reports of statements, meetings, etc. which occur in an EU Member State. The amendments simply amended these provisions to refer to reports of matters occurring in a Member State or the United Kingdom. The amendments responded to concerns expressed by the media in relation to the effects of Brexit on the defence of qualified privilege.</p></reply>

It is not open to me as Minister to comment on any aspect of the Judge's work or the process of compiling the final report. My Department maintains regular contact with the Judge and has assured him that any assistance he requires to complete his final report will be made available. </p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret that this process has taken significantly longer than any of us would like, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible. I understand that Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  Judge Haughton recently wrote to my Department seeking comments on one specific section of the draft report. The Department further understands that Judge Haughton has been in touch with the O'Farrell family regarding this matter. Following receipt of responses from all relevant parties, it is understood that Judge Haughton will be in a position to finalise his report. My Department will continue to provide all necessary assistance to the Judge, and I look forward to receiving his final report in due course.</p>  <p>  Following receipt of the final report, the advice of the Attorney General will be sought on publication and any other issues arising.</p></reply>

Clearly any stabbing has the potential to cause irreparable physical harm and tragic consequences and the Government is determined to ensure that similar problems to those which have developed in neighbouring jurisdictions do not develop here in Ireland.</p><p>There is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place with respect to knife crime, including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned. Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has an extended power of search without warrant for knives and offensive weapons and Garda&iacute; have secured a substantial number of convictions in the Courts in recent years for possession of a knife or other weapon. That said, the Department will continue to keep sentencing policy under ongoing review and will review existing Garda powers in relation to dangerous weapons, including knives, to ensure they have the necessary legal tools to protect our communities. </p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the following are the statistics, as of 16 August 2021, for the numbers of knives seized by Garda Division in each of the years 2016 to 2021.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that these statistics are based upon operational data from the PULSE system as was available on 16 August 2021 and are liable to change. </p><p>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the 2016-2018 increase in recorded seizures is due in large part to the introduction of the Property and Exhibit Management System (PEMS) which improved the level of recording of all objects seized, including knives. </p><p>More recently, the increases in seizures are also due to proactive policing operations, particularly during 2020 with the increased Garda presence due to the COVID-19 public health response. There was a 4.7% increase in the number of knives seized between 2019-2020 (2,143 in 2019 and 2,248 in 2020). There was also a substantial year-on-year increase in the number of searches conducted in 2020 &ndash; many of which were associated with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s high visibility operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

A central policy framework for Blended Working in the Civil Service will be finalised in conjunction with employee representatives over the coming months. This framework will inform the development of organisation level blended working policies tailored to the specific requirements of each Department/Office, whilst ensuring a consistency of approach across key policy areas.</p>  <p>  The proposed Blended Working Framework paper sets out a number of core principles to apply to blended working across the Civil Service post-COVID. Key to all this is the duty of Departments to deliver a quality service to Government, the Oireachtas and the public with flexibility and agility. There is recognition also of a need to create opportunities for people to balance their working and personal lives more effectively where possible.</p>  <p>  My Department has commenced work on developing its own blended working policy and arrangements, which take into account our specific business needs and requirements, while remaining grounded in the Civil Service Framework. Blended working arrangements are expected to be implemented by March 2022. </p>  <p>  In the interim, my Department will begin the process of reintroducing staff safely to the office environment, with preparations underway to start transitioning from 20 September to facilitate teams working together in the office one day a week. This transition phase will also help to inform future blended working policies and practice. All transition arrangements remain subject to change and are dependent on the public health advice in place during that time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that many of the bodies and agencies under my Department&rsquo;s remit provide frontline services and have been committed to maintaining these essential services to the public throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The organisations facilitate remote working where possible in accordance with the public health advice where operational and business needs allow but obviously this is not possible for frontline staff in agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, Forensic Science Ireland and others. I can assure the Deputy that future blended working arrangements will take operational requirements into account and will be in line with Government policy and public health guidelines.</p>  <p>  It has not been possible to collate the detailed information on costs within the timeframe allowed. I will provide this information to the Deputy as soon as it is to hand.</p></reply>

My Department is providing practical support by way of issuing humanitarian visas to facilitate travel to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Priority has been given to those working on human rights issues, including the rights of women and girls and minorities, as well as those working with NGOs and European and international organisations. To date, my Department has recently issued more than 290 humanitarian visas or visa letters for this cohort. </p>  <p>  Under the IHAP, which has closed to new applicants, approximately 70 Afghan nationals have been issued with immigration status letters by my Department so far this year, enabling them to reside and work in the State. </p>  <p>  One hundred and four Afghan family members have been granted family reunification so far this year under the International Protection Act 2015, and applications in respect of a further 64 people are being actively processed by my Department.</p>  <p>  Similarly, visa applications for Afghan family members of Irish citizens and Afghan nationals living in Ireland are being assessed speedily and sympathetically. Any person that wishes to make an application for a visa to join a family member already living in Ireland, can do so online at: www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx. Eligible family members are generally dependent family including spouses, civil partners and children under the age of 18.</p>  <p>  Anyone who wishes to apply to bring an elderly dependent to live with them in Ireland under a Stamp 0 permission can find further information on: www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-a-non-eea-non-swiss-national/dependent-elderly-relative/.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing all international protection applications on hand from Afghan nationals with a view to expediting their progress, in line with updated advices provided by UNHCR in recent weeks. These applications are already prioritised, as agreed with UNHCR. The processing of these applications takes full account of whether a person will be in danger if not provided with a permission to remain here.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to monitor and respond to the evolving situation in Afghanistan. As I have outlined, our current focus is on processing all existing and new applications on hand speedily and sympathetically. </p>  <p>  Minister Humphreys and I have directed our officials to examine, as a matter of urgency, proposals for a humanitarian admission programme whereby persons resident in Ireland could apply for family members in Afghanistan to be granted admission to Ireland.

The Programme for Government gives a clear commitment to establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being, covering gambling online and in person, and the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, I expect to be in a position to publish the Scheme of the Bill in quarter three 2021. There is a clear path towards the regulator being fully operational in early 2023. </p>  <p>  When it is established, the regulator will have the necessary enforcement powers for licensing, and powers to take action where individuals or operators are failing to follow rules and regulations.  Operators offering activities in whole or in part online, will be subject to the licensing terms and conditions as set out by the regulator. Matters regarding enforcement will also be for the gambling regulator.</p>  <p>  Key objectives of the regulator will be preventing gambling from being a source or support to crime, ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way for companies to make decisions in certainty, and requiring safeguards including in relation to gambling advertising.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, given the size, complexity and technological development of the modern gambling industry and having regard to the current outdated and complex arrangements, it will be important that the regulator will be established on a sound footing and be adequately resourced to carry out this important task. </p>  <p>  Further details on the functions and powers of the regulator will be outlined in the Scheme.</p></reply>

Therefore, a sponsor of an elderly dependent relative is required to have earned in Ireland in each of the three years preceding the application an income after tax and deductions of not less than &euro;60,000 in the case of one parent and &euro;75,000 where two parents are involved. </p>  <p>  Where the elderly dependent relative has a guaranteed income into the future, this can be used to partially offset the financial limits (bearing in mind however that a person with a sufficient personal income for their needs cannot reasonably be regarded as being financially dependent).</p>  <p>  For elderly persons of independent means, the financial threshold is generally considered to be a lump sum to purchase a property in the State plus an income in excess of &euro;50,000 per person per annum. Each application is dealt with on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  Any elderly dependent granted a permission to join their family member in the State will be granted a Stamp 0 immigration permission. An inherent condition of their residence permission is that they are required to be self-sufficient. They are not permitted to avail of State benefits while resident here on a Stamp 0 basis even if they acquire an entitlement to such benefits. Holders of Stamp 0 are also not allowed to work, operate a business or engage in a profession in the State. They must also have private medical insurance to cover the duration of their stay. A Stamp 0 may also be granted to persons who can demonstrate sufficient funds to ensure they will not become a burden on the State.</p>  <p>  While all immigration permissions are kept under review, currently, there are no plans to revise the existing thresholds for elderly dependents.</p></reply>

Government policy restricts the availability of all hazardous fireworks to the general public. Licences under the Explosives Act are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators.</p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks. An example of the penalties faced include a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment if convicted of having fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply. Igniting fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalty. These penalties demonstrate the seriousness attached to breaches of the legislation governing the importation and use of fireworks.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the distressing impact the improper use of fireworks has on our communities and I share the concerns of the Deputies and of the local communities affected. I know the fear and distress fireworks being set off causes our elderly family members and neighbours and people with sensory challenges and other vulnerabilities. They also have a terrible impact on pets and other animals and livestock. </p>  <p>  That is why every year as Halloween approaches, my Department runs a safety campaign aimed at ensuring the public is aware of the dangers of illegal fireworks and bonfires. Taking into account the issues arising and highlighted to me last year, my officials are currently collaborating with a number of relevant bodies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Dublin Fire Brigade, the Irish Society for the Prevent of Cruelty to Animals, as well as the local authorities around the country in order to ensure that our messaging for this year is clear, impactful and ready to be launched and rolled out before the end of this month. As always, this messaging will continue to be pushed out across a number of mediums including social media on a regular basis until early November. </p>  <p>  In addition to the awareness raising work undertaken by my Department in the run up to Halloween, additional efforts are made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this time of year to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks, which is known as Operation Tombola.</p>  <p>  Operation Tombola also focuses on preventing associated public disorder and anti-social behaviour through the incremental deployment of resources, including Garda Public Order Units to augment local plans as appropriate. The Garda Commissioner has informed me that under Operation Tombola, Assistant Commissioner (DMR) has already issued an instruction to each Chief Superintendent in the DMR to put in place appropriate measures to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks in the lead up to Halloween, 2021. </p>  <p>  The Assistant Commissioner (DMR) has tasked each Chief Superintendent in the DMR to examine their policing requirements for the Halloween period and to effectively resource and implement their policing plans for this period.   </p>  <p>  I understand that each Chief Superintendent in the DMR is in the process of engaging with relevant stakeholders including the local authorities to identify, coordinate and implement an appropriate multi-agency strategy for the Halloween period, as part of their policing plans and that the Assistant Commissioner (DMR) has tasked Detective Superintendent, DMR Coordination and Tasking Unit, with ensuring open social media is monitored for any information in connection with anti-social behaviour and fireworks that may inform local Garda operations and initiatives.   </p>  <p>  In addition to the above measures, the Garda National Community Engagement Bureau have also developed a Halloween safety advice presentation that is aimed at parents/guardians, and which is available for Garda&iacute; to use as part of the Community Policing Toolkit when engaging with community groups or watch schemes. This places emphasis on tips for safety around bonfires and fireworks, emphasising the illegality of the latter and explaining the distress that Halloween can cause to animals and the elderly. </p>  <p>  A revised primary schools programme has also been developed focussing on these areas and emphasises that it is the job of the Garda&iacute; to keep children safe. Where it is not possible to deliver these presentations in person, an alternative proposes to use a safety video produced in partnership with Dublin Fire Brigade and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital, which informs children of the law in relation to fireworks and the dangers associated with them. It also provides fire safety advice and, with the help of the Garda Dogs Unit, it addresses the distress experienced by animals. Supporting posters and social media material are also available for download from the Community Policing Toolkit.</p>  <p>  Finally, I believe that it is important to state that in addition to Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 referenced above, there are a number of strong legislative provisions available to Garda&iacute; to combat anti-social behaviour more generally which include &ndash;</p>  <p>  - the Criminal Damage Act 1991;</p>  <p>  - Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;</p>  <p>  - the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and</p>  <p>  - the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p></reply>

Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities, while working closely with international law enforcement partners. </p><p>The National Drugs Strategy, &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025 &quot;, is unique among national drugs strategies across EU Member States in recognising the need to address drug-related debt intimidation at a community level.  </p><p>The Programme for Government, <i>Our Shared Future</i>, includes a commitment to support the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme. The programme, which was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN), responds to the needs of drug users and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation, has been implemented on a national level since 2013. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regard drug-related intimidation as a hugely serious issue which impacts significantly on communities throughout Ireland. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advise people to seek help and support from their local Garda&iacute;, even where a person has felt compelled to pay money to those who engage in drug related intimidation.</p><p>In dealing with any complaint of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the utmost regard to the safety and most effective means to afford the person or family subject to the threat the best level of security, advice and support. Confidentiality and security of the persons concerned are paramount for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when dealing with reports under the programme.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deals with drug related intimidation in a confidential and secure manner. Insofar as possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na offers confidentiality and provides practical personal security and safety information and advice in relation to particular threats or instances of intimidation, along with information on appropriate drug support services for the individual in the family who is accruing drug debts, while also providing information regarding the process involved in making a formal complaint.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of the new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This strategy includes a commitment to develop the work of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) to include targeted work with &lsquo;harder-to-reach&rsquo; young people. This includes young people heavily involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, for whom there are little supports and interventions available in practice, unless they are before the courts, in which case they may be under the supervision of the Probation Service. The strategy also prioritises early intervention work, including with younger children who are assessed as being at serious risk. Both of these cohorts may include children at risk of recruitment by crime gangs.</p><p>The development of this work within the GYDP network will be supported by the Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL).  The REPPP project has led on the production of the &ldquo;Greentown Report&rdquo;, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland, and was published in December 2016. The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and the Department of Justice. </p><p>The Greentown Report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations.  </p><p>The Greentown Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. The programme is managed jointly between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the University of Limerick.</p><p>Pilot applications of the Greentown programme, developed by the REPPP project, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these pilots will then be incorporated into mainstream GYDP practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial pilots from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years.  </p><p>The implementation of the Greentown pilot programme is part of the strategic objectives of the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This implementation process began with the establishment of the Governance and Strategy Group, and the Youth Justice Oversight Group. Both groups are chaired by the Department of Justice, which will provide oversight arrangements for youth justice Initiatives, including the Greentown pilots, to ensure that there is a cohesive response in practice to the needs of particular cohorts of children and particular communities.</p></reply>

The formulation of criteria is guided by research, including the learning from previous regularisation schemes, such as the 2018 Student Scheme. Schemes operated by other EU Member States are also being considered in its development.  </p>  <p>  My Department is now working to finalise the details for the Scheme, including eligibility considerations and qualifying criteria, with a view to bringing a proposal to Government shortly to allow for the launch of the Scheme before the end of this year.</p></reply>

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for this Government and over the past year we have introduced significant measures to combat trafficking, to create a more victim-centred approach to identifying and supporting victims and to raise awareness and provide training.</p>  <p>  While it was very disappointing that the US State Department did not acknowledge the significant progress made by Ireland over the past 12 months as sufficient to upgrade our ranking in the latest &lsquo;Trafficking in Persons&rsquo; Report, I am confident that the work we are doing should be reflected in the next TiPs report and that Ireland&rsquo;s ranking should be upgraded accordingly.</p>  <p>  I note that a number of key areas identified in the latest TiPs Report reflect the ongoing work that is, in some cases, already well-advanced, including:</p>  <p>  - The recent approval by Government to revise the National Referral Mechanism to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified and access advice, accommodation and support;</p>  <p>  - The drafting of a new National Action Plan on Human Trafficking;</p>  <p>  - The development of training, through NGOs, targeting front line staff in industries such as hospitality, airline and shipping who may come into contact with trafficked persons;</p>  <p>  - The work being undertaken to provide dedicated accommodation for female victims of sexual exploitation;</p>  <p>  - The improvements being made to the Criminal Justice System to support victims through the implementation of Supporting A Victims Journey;</p>  <p>  - The running of a new awareness raising campaign in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to build on the success of previous campaigns:</p>  <p>  - An increase in funding for supporting victims of crime generally and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking.</p>  <p>  The latest report also highlighted that at the time of drafting there were no convictions for Human Trafficking in Ireland. In this regard it is important to highlight the significance of the recent convictions for human trafficking handed down by the Courts and to acknowledge the dedication of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating and tackling this hideous crime.</p>  <p>  It was concerning that one of the factors given weight in this latest report was the continued reliance on an assessment made in an earlier TiPs report in relation to the fishing industry. This assessment was fully investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and no evidence was found to support the allegations of widespread human trafficking in the fishing industry. It is unclear why the State Department chose to place weight on one voice and not to take account of the balance of stakeholder assessment &ndash; including assessment by NGOs active in Ireland in tackling human trafficking &ndash; that these accusations are without foundation.</p>  <p>  The allegations in that regard should be assessed also in the light of the High Court judgement in the case International Transport Workers' Federation v the Minister for Justice and Equality [2018 No. 5398 P] which referred, in refusing an application for an injunction on behalf of the International Transport Federation, inter alia, to  </p>  <p>   'the extent of reliance by the plaintiff on speculation and the reports of others without applying due process like procedures to those accounts'.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has strong separation of powers and the courts are independent of Government. A High Court judgment cannot be dismissed as an expression of opinion amongst potentially many others, but &ndash; unless overturned on appeal &ndash; is a conclusive finding of law or fact.  </p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the State Department will look at this particular issue more objectively when assessing Ireland's ranking for the next TiPs Report.</p></reply>

Work on this Bill is currently ongoing in my Department. </p>  <p>  Minister McEntee and I also met with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in December 2020 to discuss the issues of pet theft and animal welfare legislation. A collaborative approach was agreed to dealing with the issue. As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for all animal welfare issues.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to further note that my Department is kept appraised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the issue of pet theft. Under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, the theft of an animal carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment on conviction. If the animal was taken from a person's property the crime becomes burglary and attracts a potential maximum of up to 14 years imprisonment. These are significant sentences by any measure.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act for the administration and management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including all operational policing decisions. This includes crime prevention initiatives and strategies. </p>  <p>  With regard to measures aimed at preventing such thefts, I am informed by the Garda authorities that information has been disseminated to the Crime Prevention Officers' Network countrywide specifically dealing with the topic of dog thefts. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety concurs with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe.</p>  <p>  Ongoing patrols throughout the country also act as a deterrent to mobile criminals and thereby help prevent criminal activity. Improved awareness of dog thefts among the community will ensure more vigilance within neighbourhood watch and community alert areas.</p></reply>

Cancer services continue to operate in line with guidance issued by the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP).</p>  <p>  The NCCP is continuing to closely monitor trends in numbers coming forward to diagnostic services, and the level of attendances for appointments for treatment. GP e-referrals to Rapid Access Clinics (RACs) from January to July stand at 117% of the activity in the corresponding period in 2019. New attendances at RACs from January to June 2021 (24,702) is at 96% of 2019 activity (25,791).</p>  <p>  Medical and radiation and oncology services are continuing, utilising the safeguards of social distancing and infection prevention &amp;amp; control measures built up in the past year.  The number of patients receiving chemotherapy from January to April 2021 was at approximately 90% of 2019 activity, while radiation oncology was operating at 81% of 2019 activity. </p>  <p>  Urgent surgery has been prioritised and there has been an emphasis on maintaining safe patient pathways in this regard. For 2021, surgery numbers up to end of May were 64% of 2019 levels. However, this figure does not include surgeries involving public patients that were undertaken in private hospitals, so the overall figure is likely to be higher. </p>  <p>  We would point out that data for 2021 may be subject to some change due to on-going validation processes. The availability of data has also been impacted by the ransomware attack in May this year. </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;12m has been allocated this year for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of 2019 (pre-Covid) levels. This funding is being used to support hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum/temporary support. It is also supporting virtual clinics and more accurate triage, and facilitating infrastructure and minor equipment purchases to increase capacity across RACs and surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology services. </p>  <p>  In addition, as part of Budget 2021, an extra &euro;20m has been allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year. This funding is being used to facilitate developments across prevention, diagnosis, treatment and patient supports.</p></reply>

Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.  HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) recently jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel, although these have been affected by the recent cyberattack on the health system. Many of the short- and medium-term recommendations have already been implemented.</p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Nursing Home Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations.</p>  <p>  At a broader level, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of this impact since the start of the pandemic, with various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons. There has been a very clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves, and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises. Findings of these reports confirm that the very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings. The reports produced nationally identify findings consistent with international evidence, which have highlighted that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into nursing home depends on the levels of the disease circulating in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community.</p>  <p>  While significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of the vaccination programme, and the current situation in nursing homes is broadly stable, the prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant has rapidly increased in Ireland and this poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.  It must be recognised that the pandemic has not concluded and at this time a priority focus of Government remains on the ongoing management of the COVID-19 response, to ensure that the positive gains now been experienced are preserved, and that those most vulnerable to the virus continue to be safeguarded, having regard to the residual risk. </p>  <p>  The Government is continuing to look at options which may be available to the State in relation to listening to the voices of those who have lost a loved one.</p></reply>

The HSE in its National Service Plans has committed to the continued implementation of a multi annual public health plan for the therapeutic treatment of hepatitis C. The Programme is allocated funding of &euro;25m each year by my Department.</p>  <p>  The NHCTP aims to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026 and to achieve the World Health Organisation goal of eliminating hepatitis C by 2030.

In this regard, the NHCTP are currently engaged in a formal epidemiological study to determine prevalence and to facilitate informed decisions regarding screening.</p>  <p>  With the outbreak of COVID-19, hepatitis C clinics were significantly impacted. However, clinics are returning to normal and the NHCTP is confident that the Programme is on target to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026, and in alignment with the WHO goal, to fully eliminate the disease in Ireland by 2030. To ensure that these targets are met, the NHCTP has implemented the following: </p>  <p>  1.The Community Prescribing Project </p>  <p>  2.The Irish Prison Service Treatment Programme </p>  <p>  3.Extending the Seek and Treat Approach to people who are non-methadone dependant </p>  <p>  The National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme Strategy 2020-2026 is currently under consideration by the Department.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-09a.2791.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021090900052#WRZZ01100"><p>The Government has provided extensive support to the Nursing Home Sector since the start of the pandemic. The Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) was established in April 2020 as a temporary, administrative measure to respond to the challenges being faced by the nursing home sector at the start of the pandemic. Up to &euro;134m for the Scheme was made available for 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  In broad terms, the Scheme has now substantially fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes and residents to address COVID-19 and therefore phased withdrawal of support is appropriate. Standard Assistance Payments continue to be processed for costs incurred up to 30th June 2021. After this, in recognition of the residual risk presented by the virus, Minister Donnelly and I have agreed to the continued availability of the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme until the end of this year. This will ensure that contingency is available in the event of an outbreak.</p>  <p>  As the pandemic has continued, many further support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been made available through the Health Service Executive (HSE), including the provision of PPE on a no-cost basis, the implementation of serial testing, the support and engagement of COVID-19 response teams and public health teams, the temporary accommodation scheme for nursing home staff and further supports. Many of these supports will continue to be provided by the HSE for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  At the time of the Scheme&rsquo;s inception, the unprecedented nature of the emerging pandemic meant that it was necessary to put such measures in place. There has been substantial support in place to assist nursing homes to build their resilience and ensure that they are fully informed and prepared for continuing to manage COVID-19 and fulfil their legal obligation and duties to residents. The circumstances are now significantly changed, reflecting both the success of the vaccination programme along with the considerable opportunity for nursing homes, over the past 18 months with the various support measures, to learn and adapt their response to COVID-19. This is also the case for every health and non-health sector, and service providers across Ireland must similarly adapt their service model in line with the wider public health measures. </p>  <p>  Nursing homes were prioritised for vaccination, and the vast majority of residents and staff have now been vaccinated. Thankfully, notwithstanding the current epidemiological situation generally and the risks posed by the delta variant, the substantial positive vaccine effect is being seen in nursing homes with low numbers of cases reported. This is a markedly different scenario compared to turn of the year. All the relevant health agencies including the Department will continue to closely monitor the current situation to respond to any changes in the risk profile that may arise.  On the 27 July, I convened an interagency meeting with HIQA, the HSE and the Department to focus on the current situation and ongoing management of risk. The HSE and HIQA have confirmed that they continue to closely monitor the situation and that all the relevant supports, including the COVID-19 response teams, remain activated and engaged with nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The vaccination programme and other public health measures support the minimisation of and control the impact of COVID-19, with COVID-19 vaccines effective at reducing the risk of hospitalisation or severe disease. The disease will nevertheless remain part of our lives for the foreseeable future, in a manner similar to other common viruses and infections. Good infection prevention control will continue be necessary in controlling the spread of such illnesses. This should be a matter of course in all healthcare settings, as it has always been, and is supported by regulation and standards. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre will continue to monitor COVID-19 alongside other such illnesses and update public health guidance accordingly. At a point where the vast majority of residents and staff are vaccinated, outbreaks have declined significantly and where learning and preparedness, including at provider level, has had the opportunity to evolve in a supported way, the TAPS as a temporary administrative measure has fulfilled its primary purpose, within the parameters of its sanction. This end date of the Scheme was announced in October 2020.</p></reply>

This work is essential to ensure that food made available for people to eat is safe. Persons accessing homeless services are among the most vulnerable in our community and may be immunocompromised.  There is, therefore, risk of serious illness as a result of any potential food borne infection.</p>  <p>  The EHS supervises over 45,000 food businesses and endeavours to work with food business operators to encourage an understanding of the legal requirements and to support compliance with the minimum food safety standards regarding structure, operation, safety management systems and staff training and to ensure compliance with food law where non-compliances are found upon inspection.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that the EHS has neither served, nor threatened to serve, a closure order on any voluntary street-based service distributing food to the homeless.</p>  <p>  The coordination of services to people who are homeless, including the provision of accommodation and food, falls within the remit of the Department of Housing, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and the local authorities.</p>  <p>  I recognise the value of voluntary organisations in providing food and other services to people who are homeless. I would encourage these organisations to engage with the relevant homeless authorities to ensure services are provided in accordance with food safety and other regulations.</p></reply>

The total number of patients seen across all Rapid Access Clinics (RACs) in 2020 (44,233) amounted to 88% of the 2019 figure (50,249).

Our cancer diagnostic and treatment services are open, and our healthcare staff will provide any necessary care.</p><p>Funding of &euro;12m has been allocated this year for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of 2019 (pre-Covid) levels. This funding is being used to support hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum/temporary support. It is also supporting virtual clinics and more accurate triage, and facilitating infrastructure and minor equipment purchases to increase capacity across RACs and surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology services. </p><p>In addition, as part of Budget 2021, an extra &euro;20m has been allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year.

Data is held in an encoded but unencrypted form. It is an open EU wide standard and there are numerous tools and applications freely available which enable decoding of this information. Hence any device which scans these codes has the ability to display the information. It is an open inter-operable standard, so that it can be used for checks at border crossings and as such, this risk cannot be totally eliminated.</p><p>Existing safeguards in the current DCC Checker App:</p><p>1.Only limited information is displayed.</p><p>2.After 2 minutes the information of the last scanned DCC code is automatically removed from the html of the web page and any &ldquo;printing/saving&rdquo; of the page will not save any information.</p><p>3.The verifier cannot use the browser back button to view earlier scanned codes.</p><p>4.The simple, streamlined design page makes it easy for an alert user to catch someone with open browser consoles trying to capture underlying information like DOB.1</p><p>Additional improvements in the upcoming versions of DCC Checker App: At present, after decoding - all the information is available as a JSON response but the new version will mask the DoB and UVCI fields.</p><p>In relation to the question regarding who is responsible for the protection of the certificate information, whether restaurants or bars ask for people to provide mobile numbers to facilitate contact tracing or whether they ask people to provide evidence of vaccination, they still have a duty of care under GDPR to treat that personal information correctly and in compliance with data protection regulations.</p></reply>

Under this programme, adult GMS patients, those who hold a medical card or GP visit card, with a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes are eligible to be managed as part of the programme by their GP.</p>  <p>  The 2019 GP Agreement introduced the chronic disease management (CDM) programme for GMS patients who have one or more specific chronic diseases, of which Type 2 Diabetes is one. The structured programme, commenced in 2020, is being rolled out to all adult GMS patients over four years (2020 to 2023), and will replace the Diabetes cycle of care programme as it is rolled out.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card.</p>  <p>  While Type 2 diabetic patients who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card are not eligible under the Diabetes cycle of care or the CDM programme, diabetes is one of the conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme. Under this scheme, patients with diabetes can receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness free of charge, regardless of whether they hold a medical card.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to calculate the cost of extending the CDM programme, the successor to the diabetes cycle of care programme, to all with type 2 diabetes as the fees payable to GPs could only be determined following agreement with the IMO on the scope and content of the extended service, as well as the cost of the additional supports necessary to provide for that service. It is not possible to provide an accurate estimate based on the fees payable to GPs under the CDM programme due to issues such as the lack of current prevalence data, the number of undiagnosed patients and patient uptake, and comorbidity.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.  </p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p><p>The HSE continues to work to improve access, particularly to urgent colonoscopy services. In addition, the NTPF is working closely with individual hospitals to improve access to endoscopy/colonoscopy services for waiting list patients, including through the outsourcing of G.I. Scopes treatment to private hospitals for clinically suitable patients, where capacity is available.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy regarding the number of persons awaiting an Endoscopy at University Hospital Waterford; the number of persons who have been waiting up to 30, 30 to 60, 60 to 90 and more than 90 days is outlined in the attached document.</p></reply>

Of course there are a small percentage of the overall number who have yet to receive their vaccination certificates and this relates to a number of factors e.g GPs who are uploading remaining data and also in cases where the quality of data is sufficient. This accounts for less than 0.9 % of all those vaccinated to-date. </p><p>To support the roll-out of Government policy, a helpline through the DCC Call-Center was set up to allow those members of the public who are travelling to deal directly with queries relating to the Digital COVID Certificate from Monday 19th of July 2021. The call centre has also since introduced new additional service channels. A new online form to request Recovery certificates for eligible persons was released on 22 July. Following this a portal allowing for Vaccine Certificate Request, Vaccine Certificate Details Update and a Vaccine Status portal were launched on the 30th July.  </p><p>In order to mobilise the DCC Call-Center, DoH entered into a contract with Accenture to capture service requirements for the coming months. The contract, envisaged to run for 7 months, is based on an estimated fee of &euro;6.5 million relating to an agreed scope, assumptions and estimate volumes. The contract fee is structured on a blend of components including a time and materials rate card based on the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) Multi Supplier Framework Agreement for the Provision of External ICT Technical Support Services (between Accenture Limited and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform), an estimate of fees based on a bill of materials for a CRM system, fixed fees based on call-agents resource levels and technology deployed and projected call volume from members of the public. The actual fees are determined on a monthly basis based on actual services and their performance levels delivered during the previous months, and the actual usage of consumption based services linked to call volumes from members of the public  <i>.</i></p></reply>

The responses are gathered and returned to the Central Monitoring Committee annually. The survey returns show that the number of declarations has almost doubled from 3.6% in 2015 to 7.1% in 2020. </p>  <p>  The Department engages in the following activities to promote and support the employment of people with a disability:</p>  <p>  - Recruitment is dealt with through the Public Appointments Service, and as such, is subject to the policies and procedures in place for that organisation, in particular, I refer you to the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024.</p>  <p>  - Follows the Civil Service Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disabilities. </p>  <p>  - Has a designated DLO to act as the point of contact for staff with disabilities, their line managers and the HR Unit to provide assistance and support to both staff and their line managers by the provision of information, advice and supports, where necessary. </p>  <p>  - Participates in the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM), which is a work placement programme that aims to promote access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities. There was one WAM placement in 2020. </p>  <p>  - The Department facilitated a weeklong transition year student work experience programme from two local schools in 2020 with 4 out of 8 of these students living with disabilities. The purpose of this programme is to encourage these students to pursue a career in the civil service. </p>  <p>  - Provides training to staff </p>  <p>  - The Department also periodically offers unconscious bias, disability awareness, diversity &amp;amp; inclusion and SAFETalk training to department staff </p>  <p>  A Monitoring Committee within the Department of Health collects annual data on the number of people with a disability employed in the HSE (including section 38 agencies) and Non-Commercial State Agencies. Out of the 23 agencies reported on for 2020, 19 of them met or exceeded the current target of 3%. 7 of these agencies already exceeded the future target of 6%. The Monitoring Committee and the National Disability Authority work with the agencies under the Department&rsquo;s aegis in order to meet and exceed the targets set. The reasons for the failure of a small number of agencies to meet the national target are explored and discussed, with feedback given to improve for the coming year.</p></reply>

Reactogenicity occurred at a slightly higher frequency in these age groups compared to adults, but side effects from the vaccine were similar to those experienced by adults e.g. injection site pain, fatigue, headache. Vaccination in those 12-15 years is associated with short-lived, self-limited side effects. </p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee considered the benefits and risks to this age group of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the short and longer-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on children and young people in this age group and recommended that vaccination be extended to those aged 12-15 years. COVID-19 infections in those aged 12-15 years are usually asymptomatic or mild. Hospitalisation rates, rates of ICU admission are very low and death is rare. This does not exclude the possibility of severe COVID-19 developing, even in the previously healthy child. The risk of hospitalisation is higher in those with underlying chronic medical conditions and can approach that of older adults with risk conditions. NIAC also considered other potential risk factors for children and young people aged 12-15 years as a result of contracting SARS-Cov-2 COVID-19 including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and long-COVID, as well as the psycho-social impact of COVID-19 on this age group. </p>  <p>  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended granting an extension of indication to both Comirnaty and Spikevax to include use in children aged 12 years and older and has concluded that the benefits of Comirnaty and Spikevax in children and young people in this age group outweigh the risks, in particular in those with conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19.</p></reply>

This does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the adverse experience<b>.</b>The information received by the HPRA may also be limited at the time of initial reporting (for example the report may or may not specify whether the patient has been hospitalised), and more information about individual reports may become available through follow-up.</p><p>The majority of regularly reported suspected side effects are consistent with the types of events typically observed following vaccination, including those described in the product information for the individual vaccines. Whilst not experienced by everyone, all vaccines have some side effects, the vast majority of which are mild to moderate in nature. These side effects need to be continuously balanced against the benefits of preventing COVID-19 illness. Overall, the national reporting experience in Ireland continues to support the assessment that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the risks.</p><p>The HPRA has been publishing regular public safety updates on reporting experience with COVID-19 vaccines, including information on the numbers and nature of these reports.

The Chief Inspector, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. </p><p>As the independent regulator of nursing homes, the Chief Inspector determines the appropriate approach and interventions required to monitor and ensure compliance with the regulatory framework. The Chief Inspector adopts a risk-based approach to regulation, prioritising monitoring, inspection and enforcement, based on the assessment of the risk, including the type of enforcement action to be taken. </p><p>Part 8 of the Health Act 2007 sets out the tools for enforcement available to the Chief Inspector in the event that a provider is non-compliant with specific provisions within the Act or the aligned regulations.  </p><p>Specifically the Chief Inspector may issue the provider with a warning and time frame to come into compliance and where there is a sustained failure to achieve compliance the Chief Inspector may:</p><p>- place conditions on a centre&rsquo;s registration;</p><p>- cancel the centre&rsquo;s registration or refuse to renew the registration;</p><p>- prosecute the provider.</p><p><b><i>Conditions on a centre&rsquo;s registration </i></b></p><p>Every designated centre is registered with 3 standard conditions which reflect the service, the building and the number of residents who can live in that centre. Applying additional conditions to the registration of a nursing home makes it clear that the ongoing registration of the nursing home is dependent on the registered provider adhering to the condition. The following is an example of an additional condition:</p><p><b>&quot;Condition 4 </b></p><p><i>Notwithstanding the requirements placed on the registered provider to comply with the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated centres for Older People) Regulations 2013, the registered provider shall take all necessary action to comply with: Regulation 23: Governance and Management Regulation 4: Policies and Procedures Regulation 26: Risk Management Regulation 27: Infection Control Regulation 8: Protection Regulation 17: Premises Regulation 6: Healthcare Regulation 5: Individualised assessment and care plan to the satisfaction of the Chief Inspector</i>.&quot;</p><p>To date:</p><p>- 113 nursing homes have additional restrictive conditions placed upon them.</p><p><b><i>Cancellation of a centre&rsquo;s registration or refusal to renew its registration</i></b></p><p>Repeated findings of regulatory non-compliance and concern about the care and welfare of residents may result in the Chief Inspector cancelling the registration of a centre or refusing to renew the registration of a centre. </p><p>Since the beginning of 2020 the Chief Inspector has:</p><p><i>Used Section 50 of the Health Act to:</i></p><p>- refuse an application to register a nursing home on the grounds that the applicant could not demonstrate compliance with relevant regulations;</p><p>- refuse an application to renew the registration of a nursing home on the grounds that the applicant could not demonstrate compliance with relevant regulations; and,</p><p>- to reduce the occupancy of a nursing home from 53 to 37 when the provider failed to come into compliance with relevant regulations.</p><p><i>Used Section 51 of the Health Act to:</i></p><p>- cancel the registration of one nursing home when the provider passed away; and,</p><p>- issue a notice of proposed decision to cancel the registration of one nursing home when the provider failed to come into compliance with relevant regulations.</p><p><i>Used Section 52 of the Health Act to:</i></p><p>- reduce the occupancy of a nursing home from 86 to 43 when the provider failed to come into compliance with relevant regulations.</p><p><i>Used Section 59 of the Health Act to:</i></p><p>- apply to the District Court to cancel the registration of two nursing homes:</p><p>1.Donore Nursing Home, Bray (Registered Provider: Brecon Care Limited)</p><p>2.Oaklands Nursing Home, Listowel (Bolden (Nursing) Limited.)</p><p><b><i>Prosecutions </i></b></p><p>The Chief Inspector has twice prosecuted registered providers of nursing homes for breaches of the Health Act 2007.</p><p><i>Chief Inspector v Registered Provider, Carysfort Nursing Home</i></p><p>Section 65 of the Health Act 2007 requires a registered provider of a designated centre to submit information to the Chief Inspector of Social Services which the Chief Inspector deems necessary for the performance of her functions under the Health Act 2007. The defendant was named on the register maintained by the Chief Inspector as the registered provider of Carysfort Nursing Home. In March 2018, the defendant failed to submit information requested by the Chief Inspector under Section 65 of the Health Act 2007 to enable the Chief Inspector to carry out her functions under the Health Act 2007. The Chief Inspector commenced a prosecution against the defendant in March 2018 contrary to section 79(2)(a) of the Health Act 2007 as amended, the penalty for which is provided for under Section 79(4) of the Health Act 2007 as amended. The defendant pleaded guilty to the offence at Dublin District Court on the 12 March 2020 and was convicted and a fine was imposed of &euro;500 with 6 months to pay. </p><p><i>Chief Inspector of Social Services v. Hillcrest House Nursing Home Limited</i></p><p>Section 46 of the Health Act 2007 prohibits the operation of a nursing home in the absence of registration and this is an offence under Section 79 of the Health Act 2007. This prosecution was commenced by the Chief Inspector of Social Services on the 21 December 2018 against the provider of residential service to older persons, namely Hillcrest House Nursing Home Limited. The prosecution was for failure to comply with Sections 46(1) and 79(1)(b) of the Health Act i.e. failure by the service provider to register the residential service with the Chief Inspector in accordance with the legislation. Hillcrest House Nursing Home Limited pleaded guilty to the offence at a sitting of Donegal District Court on the 20 March 2019. The District Court convicted the defendant and imposed a fine of &euro;500 with 3 months to pay.</p></reply>

An increasing number of reports and studies are now being published on the topic, however, at present there is no agreement on the definition or the terminology.</p><p>It is recognised that persistent and prolonged symptoms can occur after acute COVID-19 infection in a proportion of patients, including in some patients who did not develop symptoms severe enough to require hospitalisation. My Department, through the Health Research Board, continues to fund research into the clinical impacts of COVID-19.</p><p>Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate. People in the community who are concerned about persistent symptoms following Covid-19 should contact their GP in the first instance. Treatment is currently focused on management of specific symptoms. </p><p>Specific guidance on the treatment of 'Long COVID' is presently under development both here and internationally.</p><p>The HSE is currently assessing need and the best way to care for those impacted by Long COVID to ensure the appropriate supports are in place. As part of this work on post-COVID care, the HSE is examining how it can model the possible numbers that will be affected, noting that this will take time as more evidence emerges. I understand that the HSE has also been in touch with a group of people who are suffering post-COVID symptoms to inform understanding. </p><p>The Department of Health will continue to develop an understanding of the implications of Long COVID to inform policy as appropriate.</p></reply>

The cyberattack had the effect of removing access to most patient care systems and central business systems within the HSE. The initial efforts during phase 3 focused on restoring core patient care systems such as hospital radiotherapy, laboratory, imaging, pharmacy, mental health and patient administration systems along with basic email services. The HSE continues to work through the restoration phase and recently advised that over 95% of all servers and devices had been restored. Acute, community and corporate services are almost fully restored. </p><p>The majority of HSE staff can now have access email and most HSE Corporate systems have been restored.

The HSE has deployed additional expertise, resources and technology to provide enhanced monitoring of systems and networks whilst it procures  a permanent Security Operations Centre that will provide routine security and threat incidence monitoring in future.</p><p>Following a similar cyber attack at the Department of Health, all systems were restored to normal operational status within a relatively short period following the incident.

In accordance with the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The HSE assesses each application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of income that an individual can earn per week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.  </p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card income thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax, PRSI and the Universal Social Charge (USC) have been deducted. Certain expenses are also taken into account, for example mortgage payments, which helps to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that most social welfare payments (including Invalidity Pension) are means assessed as part of a medical card application once the applicant or spouse/partner has another source of income.  However, where an applicant&rsquo;s household income is made up solely of social welfare payments, they will be eligible for a medical card.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, income thresholds for a medical card (and GP visit cards) increase for those aged 66 to 69. Given that persons aged 66 will usually transfer to a State Pension at this point, if an applicant or married/co-habiting couple's household income remains comprised of social welfare payments solely they would continue to hold eligibility for a medical card.  Therefore, transferring from an Invalidity Pension to the State Pension does not of itself result in a person losing eligibility for a medical card.  In certain circumstances, an applicant or married/co-habiting couple may transfer to the State Pension but may then also be in receipt of additional income such as a private or occupational pension. This can result in such persons having to undergo a financial assessment to be reassessed to determine their eligibility for a medical card. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should also be noted that the current eligibility framework is kept under regular review throughout the year. In relation to this particular issue as an anomaly does not arise further review of the matter is not considered necessary.</p></reply>

I met with representatives from the group referred to by the Deputy on 12 July this year, with members of bereaved families in attendance, and have subsequently corresponded with the Group. </p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. The Expert Panel report, which was published in August 2020, has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified. </p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders. The recommendations of the report are varied and complex, are short, medium,and longer-term in nature, and require a mix of ongoing operational response to COVID-19 and a longer-term strategic reform. Those strategic reforms are, by their nature, complex and relate to whole of system issues. Many of the short- and medium-term recommendations have already been implemented.</p>  <p>  At a broader level, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of this impact since the start of the pandemic, with various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons. The significant examination undertaken by the Expert Panel provides important learning and a framework for enhancing older persons services both in the short and long-term and this work is progressing.</p>  <p>  The progression of the safe staffing framework in nursing homes is included in the recommendations of the Expert Panel report. Phase 3 of the Safe Staffing and Skill Mix Framework commenced in August 2020. This includes three distinct stages, the first of which will focus on nursing homes. This is a unique stage of the framework development as it is the first time it will span across public, private, and voluntary care settings. A National Taskforce, with representation from key stakeholders and agencies, has been established to develop a Framework for safe staffing and skill mix in long-term residential care settings for older persons. This important programme of work is progressing very well and it is anticipated that pilot testing of a model of staffing will commence with a baseline data collection in each of the pilot sites in the coming month.</p></reply>

Different approaches to the provision of personalised budgets are currently being piloted, and any decision to extend personalised budgets to a greater number of individuals, and the form that would take, will depend on the outcomes from the pilot project underway across all CHO areas and its evaluation.</p>  <p>  A purely cost-neutral approach would not involve additional expenditure in terms of the actual Personalised Budgets themselves. It is estimated that around 37,000 people receive either a residential or a day service, Personal Assistance or Home Support, at a cost of around &euro;1.95bn. Providing 540 Personalised Budgets could involve the conversion of approximately 1.5% of that element of the Disability Services to Personalised Budgets, or a redeployment of around &euro;30m of those funds. In a cost-neutral scenario, the ongoing costs of operating a Personalised Budget for the individual, such as dealing with matters like hiring, rosters, payroll administration, insurance, tax, and HR, would come from the individuals Personalised Budget.</p>  <p>  However realistically any widescale deployment of Personalised Budgets would entail some overhead costs to the HSE in terms of staff to support applicants through the application process, use of a standardised Assessment Tool to assess the support needs of the individual, and transition and set-up costs to develop new systems. International experience, and Irish experience to date, suggests that many applicants may not proceed to a Personalised Budget, if they consider that the benefits of a personalised budget arrangement may be outweighed by factors like the ongoing administration involved for themselves in organising such arrangements. To reach 540 Personal Budgets in operation would involve processing significantly greater numbers of requests as a number of people may decide to opt out at various stages along the path.</p>  <p>  Internationally, research across a number of jurisdictions suggests the uptake on Personalised Budgets is approximately 8%.</p>  <p>  Pending the conclusion and evaluation of the existing Personalised Budgets pilot programme, it is not possible to say with any accuracy what the overhead costs of a more widespread provision of this option would be. However, it is likely to involve a national programme office, plus dedicated staffing in each CHO area to support applicants through the application and transition process and carry out needs assessments; licensing for a national standard assessment tool and software, and training in the use of same; support around unbundling of current funding; and communication support including a website, Easy to Read materials and ISL interpretation. Preliminary estimates suggest that such overhead costs could be of the order of &euro;1.5m for a minimum national and local support service for supports to the applications process and making transitions to personal budgets, however the higher the volume of applications to reach a target 540 users, the higher those overheads would become.</p>  <p>  [1] Towards Personalised Budgets for People with a Disability in Ireland &ndash; Report of the Taskforce on Personalised Budgets (2018)</p></reply>

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service.  </p>  <p>  The HSE does not directly hire GPs and there is no approved salary scale in the public service for a GP post.  Equally, there is no appropriate measure of other costs required to ensure that a directly-employed GP could provide an adequate service (such as the cost of support staff, equipment costs, or other overheads).

It is not possible to provide an estimate of the cost specifically associated with each bed. However, as a guideline, it should be noted that the construction costs for a 15 bed unit average &euro;10m, with fit-out costs in the region of &euro;1.5m.</p>  <p>  The revenue funding required to operate a 15 bed specialist palliative care inpatient unit is &euro;3.8m per annum which equates to &euro;253,000 per bed per year.</p>  <p>  Finally, a 5 bed unit would not be considered as the staffing levels and related revenue costs would be prohibitive and maintaining a high level of clinical care would be very challenging. The locations for new inpatient units have been identified in line with national policy and the HSE's Pallative Care Development Framework 2017-2019, with units ranging from 15-36 beds.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p></reply>

Following the approval of the Finance Act 2020 which provides for the medical criteria in primary legislation, the Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, T.D., issued an instruction to the HSE to recommence assessments from 1st January, 2021.</p><p>The ability to hold assessments has been impacted by, among other things, the public health restrictions in place to suppress and manage the spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately there were delays in the processing of assessments due to the involvement of the HSE Medical Doctors in the national COVID-19 response and Schools Immunisation programme.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that it is continuing to monitor the situation in the context of resuming the range of services that are provided by Community Medical Doctors under the HSE Service Recovery and Restoration Plan, taking into account the pressures and challenges to the health services presented by COVID.</p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for consideration and direct reply to the Deputy</p></reply>

With gradual increases in staffing and other additional resources, the GMHS has been able to incrementally expand the number of services offered during the course of 2021.</p>  <p>  The GMHS PrEP service has recommenced and is seeing both new and returning service users. The Clinic&rsquo;s Consultant in Infectious Diseases (GMHS and GUIDE Clinic, St James&rsquo;s Hospital) and other doctors are providing virtual consultations, and PrEP service users attend GMHS for STI screening, blood testing and treatment as required. </p>  <p>  Those with diagnosed STIs or requiring Hepatitis and/or HPV vaccine continue to be treated in GMHS also. A weekly STI clinic has commenced for symptomatic screening and treatment of both new and returning service users and, also, follow up for those who require further treatment or vaccinations. The GMHS Nurse led asymptomatic screening service has also been re-instated, following the recent HSE cyber-attack. </p>  <p>  The closure of the GMHS in 2020 resulted from the pressures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and related primarily to the necessary redeployment of increasing numbers of personnel to diverse COVID-19 related duties. Staff in the Gay Men&rsquo;s Health Service (GMHS) were reassigned, by reason of necessity, to other HSE services.  Following the GMHS closure, significant efforts were made to maintain service provision through other locations, including the GUIDE Clinic in St. James&rsquo; Hospital. </p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, the GMHS was staffed by 97% agency staff; this is no longer the case. Funding for the PrEP programme allowed pro-rata recurring funding to be allocated to GMHS in 2020. As a result of pandemic related pressures on staffing, recruitment in 2020 initially focused on the services required to support the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  However, the HSE advises that a recruitment campaign to fill the posts for the GMHS PrEP programme commenced in the latter part of 2020 and is progressing well. 6 permanent posts in GMHS have been filled, with 3 still in recruitment phase. Furthermore, interviews for a permanent consultant position are expected to take place in September.  IT improvements have also been put in place. </p>  <p>  HSE Community Healthcare East advises that they have made every effort to restore, and maintain services as far as is possible, given current pandemic related pressures on resources.</p>  <p>  All health services, including the GMHS, are continuing to face constraints, resulting from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. It should be noted that, in order to ensure compliance with HSE Covid-19 safety measures, capacity at clinics is somewhat reduced.. Constraints include attendance by appointment only, or online as a result of the need to maintain social distancing. </p>  <p>  The GMHS will continue to reinstate services on a phased basis and in line with the HSE's Safe Return to Work Guide. Officials from the Department of Health and HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme are in regular contact with CHO6 in order to monitor progress. It is hoped that it will be possible to increase capacity as recruitment progresses, vaccination rates increase, and Covid-19 restrictions can safely be scaled back, in line with official guidelines.</p>  <p>  The GMHS website is updated regularly, and provides full details of services available, as these are reinstated. It is hoped that GMHS services can be delivered to their full potential and developed further, once pandemic related constraints on health service capacity as a whole can be safely reduced.</p>  <p>  HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is available, free of charge through the HSE, to those at substantial risk of acquiring HIV through sexual activity. PrEP is delivered through approved services that meet the National Standards for PrEP Service Delivery (www.sexualwellbeing.ie/prepproviders ) and is being rolled out in a phased manner. There are currently thirteen public and nine private approved PrEP service providers in Ireland www.sexualwellbeing.ie/getprep.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;5.4 million was secured for PrEP in 2020, including allocations for the recruitment of additional staff. Funding and roll-out of the programme continues in 2021.</p>  <p>  Whilst the PrEP programme remains fully funded, implementation has been impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. All health services, including STI/HIV/PrEP services, are continuing to face constraints, resulting from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. These include attendance by appointment only, or online as a result of the need to maintain social distancing.</p>  <p>  With regard to PrEP provision in Dublin, the HSE advise that two of the four Dublin based services have indicated that they currently need to limit new PrEP appointments. However, the other two services anticipate some additional capacity in the coming months. Of note, two large Dublin based services have reported an increase in the number of patients not attending their appointments, which has generated some extra capacity but an additional associated workload in determining the needs and wishes of those who have not attended for appointment.</p>  <p>  The HSE has provided the following recruitment update with respect to PrEP:</p>  <p>  Gay Men's Health Service: 6 permanent positions have been filled, 3 are still in recruitment phase, and a permanent consultant position is also in recruitment phase</p>  <p>  GUIDE Clinic, St James' Hospital: All agreed PrEP posts have been recruited on a permanent basis (8 individuals with an aggregate whole time equivalent (WTE) of 4.32)</p>  <p>  St Vincent's University Hospital: All agreed PrEP posts have been recruited on a permanent basis (4 individuals with a WTE of 3.0)</p>  <p>  Mater Misericordiae University Hospital: All agreed PrEP posts have been recruited on a permanent basis (5 individuals with a WTE of 4.25), with the exception of part of the 0.5 WTE consultant post (a permanent 0.2 WTE is in place, the additional 0.3 WTE is under recruitment).</p></reply>

With regard to recommending daily Vitamin D supplements to the entire adult population, the current policy advice on vitamin D supplementation is aimed at three population groups; infants, 1-4 year old children and all adults 65 years and over.</p>  <p>  Recommendation (2). Regarding vitamin D supplementation of the entire population, my Department has requested the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to review the evidence on this and provide me with recommendations. This is the process used by my Department to ensure evidence- based advice.  </p>  <p>  Once the Food Safety Authority of Ireland recommendations are received, we will develop a public health policy to increase knowledge and encourage increased intake of Vitamin D through supplementation, if appropriate.</p>  <p>  Recommendation (3). The issue of reducing the cost of Vitamin D supplementation by reconsidering the current VAT rate applied is a matter for the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  Recommendation (4). The issue of specific measures being put in place for frontline and healthcare workers is a matter for the HSE and my Department have referred this to HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the schools-based immunisation programme for the 2019/2020 academic year has been completed and the uptake rates for the HPV vaccine in that academic year are 82% for the first dose of the vaccine and 77% for the second dose. This is the highest uptake for the HPV vaccination programme since 2015/2016 and is particularly encouraging because it was the first year that boys were included in the programme and it shows that the provision of vaccine in community clinics did not adversely affect the uptake.</p>  <p>  The programme for the academic year 2020/2021 was paused during the first few months of 2021 due to school closures and redeployment of staff to the COVID-19 immunisation programme. The inputting of uptake information for the schools-based programme has also been delayed due to redeployment of administrative staff. However, Community Healthcare Organisations have reported that the vast majority of second level schools had their first dose of HPV vaccine delivered between October and December 2020.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  The uptake rate for the first dose of the HPV vaccine, in the 2020/2021 academic year, is 72% as of 17 August 2021, and this figure is expected to increase because data input on vaccine uptake is ongoing. The HSE expects the HPV vaccination programme for 2020/2021 to be substantially complete before the start of the 2021/2022 academic year.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.  </p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p><p>In relation to average waiting times, the NTPF has advised that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times. In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided here.</p></reply>

PrEP is delivered through approved services that meet the National Standards for PrEP Service Delivery and is being rolled out in a phased manner. There are currently thirteen public and nine private approved PrEP service providers in Ireland www.sexualwellbeing.ie/getprep.</p><p>The roll-out of the national PrEP programme was a significant landmark in the implementation of the <i>National Sexual Health Strategy, 2015-2020</i>. Funding of &euro;5.4 million was secured for PrEP in 2020, including allocations for the recruitment of additional staff. Funding and roll-out of the programme continues in 2021. </p><p>Whilst the PrEP programme remains fully funded, implementation has been impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. All health services, including STI/HIV/PrEP services, are continuing to face constraints, resulting from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. These include attendance by appointment only, or online as a result of the need to maintain social distancing, and the necessary redeployment of personnel to diverse COVID-19 related duties, which include testing, contact tracing, vaccination and front-line patient care.</p><p>However, despite Covid-19 related restrictions, the national PrEP programme has continued to expand. At the end of Q1 2021, there was a total of 2,995 persons registered and clinically approved for reimbursement. Data for Q2 2021 is awaited, but has been delayed owing to the recent cyber-attack.  <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Q4 2019 </th>       <th>Q1 2020 </th>       <th>Q2 2020 </th>       <th>Q3 2020 </th>       <th>Q4 2020 </th>       <th>Q1 2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of new individuals registered for PrEP </td>       <td>658 </td>       <td>674 </td>       <td>301 </td>       <td>502 </td>       <td>547 </td>       <td>313 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Despite significant service restrictions in 2020/21 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, PrEP services continued to see new and review existing PrEP service users. Many services adapted how they worked, delivering some care on a virtual platform.  </p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the HSE SHCPP has been in regular communication with public STI/PrEP services and community partners, and is working together with HIV Ireland to maintain an updated list of service availability. Information for users on how to access services is available here, www.hivireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/Sexual-Health-Service-Restrictions.pdf. </p><p>Services have been working hard to restore and increase service capacity throughout 2021 notwithstanding the challenges faced by the ongoing pandemic, the recent cyber-attack and, most recently, a national Early Infectious Syphilis outbreak. </p><p>I advised by the HSE that while two of the four Dublin based services have indicated that they currently need to limit new PrEP appointments, the other two services anticipate some additional capacity in the coming months. Of note, two large Dublin based services have reported an increase in the number of patients not attending their appointments, which has generated some extra capacity but an additional associated workload in determining the needs and wishes of those who have not attended for appointment. </p><p>Service users seeking appointments in Dublin should continue to visit service websites for updates on availability or endeavour to contact services to obtain an appointment or be put on a waiting list for an appointment. The full list of approved PrEP services and contact details is available on www.sexualwellbeing.ie/getprep. </p><p>Service users are advised to use condoms while they are awaiting an appointment. Condoms are available for free from a range of settings including public STI clinics; NGO and community organisations; and third level institutions, through the National Condom Distribution Service. For more information, please see the 2020 NCDS activity report here: </p><p>Regular STI testing is an integral part of care for those taking HIV PrEP. The current availability of free online testing for those in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare, Cork and Kerry has increased STI testing access. Information on STIs, testing, safer sex and HIV prevention is available on . </p><p>Needless to say, funding remains in place for the national PrEP programme and it is hoped that this service can be delivered to its full potential and developed further, once pandemic related constraints on the health service as a whole can be reduced safely.</p></reply>

This framework will inform the development of organisation level blended working policies tailored to the specific requirements of each Department/Office, whilst ensuring a consistency of approach across key policy areas. </p><p>Senior human resources staff and CEOs of the agencies under the aegis of my Department have been kept fully briefed in respect of the development of the Civil Service Framework and the shift towards blended working patterns for the post-Covid era.It is intended that the public sector, including the agencies under the aegis of my Department, will develop their own blended working policies based on the principles set out in the Blended Working Framework for the post-Covid era when it is agreed.</p><p>My Department has established an internal Blended Working Group involving key Corporate functional areas which is examining the practical implications of facilitating blended working by staff in the Department of Health. This will be ongoing over the coming months and will take account of central framework on remote working from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. An application process for blended working will be put in place for the staff of my Department and the public health sector staff in due course.</p><p>Over the past 3 years my Department has had a rolling programme in place to issue all staff with a personal laptop, as opposed to a desktop device.  These devices are used in the office and are also in use by staff as they work remotely at present.  For health and safety reasons, staff have been facilitated in bringing home some other equipment from the office, e.g. office chairs and peripheral ICT equipment such as a keyboard, mouse and external monitor, to provide for an ergonomically appropriate work-station as they are required to work remotely.</p><p>In line with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Guidance on working arrangements during COVID-19 for the Civil and Public Service, it has been decided that public service employers should not pay a daily allowance to their employees in respect of working from home. My Department does not pay broadband or phone costs for staff, other than the normal arrangements where a mobile phone is provided on an identified business need.  It is open to employees to make claims directly from Revenue in respect of actual costs incurred in working from home at the end of the relevant tax year, in accordance with relevant Revenue rules. Any claim in this regard is solely a matter for the individual concerned. </p><p>In respect of costs in the agencies under the aegis of my Department, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter. The information has been sought from the Non-Commercial State Agencies, and once collated, will be provided by way of separate letter to the Deputy.</p><p>In line with the Government campaign - #MakingRemoteWork &ndash; I am supportive of facilitating all reasonable and practical applications for blended working, while ensuring the continued effective and efficient delivery of the Department&rsquo;s business.</p></reply>

The introduction of the tax was an important action in the Obesity Policy and Action Plan, with the aim of combatting obesity through reducing consumption of added sugar in drinks and encouraging reformulation of products by the drinks industry.</p><p>Initial indications are that the tax has had a positive impact, particularly in terms of encouraging drinks producers to reduce the sugar content in their products. However, a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of the tax is needed, and the Department has commenced an evaluation of the measure.</p><p>The first step in this process was to look at existing examples that could inform the methodology to assess the impacts of the tax. This work is well advanced. The literature review and data scoping exercise will enable the Department to make an assessment of the potential approaches to evaluate the impact of the tax and the timelines and resources required for the evaluation. It is intended that the evaluation will be published when completed.</p></reply>

A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the recipients and the donors of blood and blood products. The IBTS constantly keeps all deferral policies under active review, in the light of scientific evidence, emerging infections and international evidence, to ensure the ongoing safety of blood and the products derived from it. </p>  <p>  The IBTS lifted its lifelong ban on men who have sex with men (MSM) from donating blood in January 2017, when the deferral policy was reduced to a period of one year following their last sexual encounter with a man.  My Department has established a post-implementation surveillance monitoring group, which is scheduled to meet later this week.  The group will assess the impact, if any, on the incidence of transfusion transmitted infections, following the change to donor deferral policies in 2017.  The output of this Group will contribute to the evidence base that can inform future decisions on proposed changes to deferral policies, including any future changes to MSM deferral policy.</p>  <p>  The IBTS established an independent &lsquo;Advisory Committee for Social Behaviours Review&rsquo; to review the evidence base for donor selection, deferral and exclusion in Ireland in relation to social behaviours that may increase the risk of acquiring specific blood-borne infections. The Advisory Committee aims to conclude its work in September 2021 and submit its report to the IBTS for consideration. My Department will be engaging with the IBTS during the course of this work.</p></reply>

However, the Dept of Health has supported the continued operation of drug and alcohol support groups and treatment programmes given their importance for the health and wellbeing of participants. It is committed to continue to provide bespoke guidance for this important health sector. </p><p>The Department has advised that the maximum number of participants in drug and alcohol support groups and treatment programmes can be increased from 15 to 20, to include organisers. This higher limit is subject to 2 metre social distancing in the venue. </p><p>A further increase in the maximum number of participants will be considered on foot of the Government roadmap to further re-open social and economic activities, which was recently published. </p><p>The following guidance should be taken into account in increasing the number of participants in support groups and programmes:</p><p>- All participants should be encouraged to available of the Covid-19 vaccination. Vaccination will not alone protect them from the impact of the disease, but will  protect other participants in support groups and programme. Vaccination is an important contribution to social solidarity. </p><p>- The Delta variant of Covid-19 is highly infectious and poses a major risk to the population, in particular those who are not vaccinated. Public health advice remains that the non-vaccinated should avoid congregated indoor settings. Other meeting formats - outdoors and online - should continue to be provided.  </p><p>- People living with drug and alcohol addictions may experience poor physical health and weakened immune systems, making them especially vulnerable to Covid-19. Participants who are vaccinated may continue to face these heightened risks due to weakened immune systems. </p><p>- Masks remain an important protective measure for everyone, including those that are fully vaccinated. Good ventilation of indoor venues is also imperative. </p><p>I appreciate the positive engagement by drug and alcohol support groups with the Department on this matter and their patience as we sought clarification on what was possible given the continuing public health restrictions. </p><p>My officials will continue to engage with these group to further increase attendance at indoor meetings, in line with the Government roadmap.</p></reply>

Thanks to the hard work of the Irish people and the progress of our vaccination programme, we are now entering a new phase in the management of the pandemic. As our approach to the management of COVID-19 transitions from population wide restrictions to guidance we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours, including in relation to self-isolation and restricting movements when advised, observing good respiratory and hand hygiene, physical distancing and mask wearing when appropriate. </p><p><i>COVID-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting </i>can be found online: <i>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/f5291-post-cabinet-statement-covid-19-reframing-the-challenge-continuing-our-recovery-and-reconnecting/</i></p></reply>

This will add 1,146 general acute beds to the hospital system over the number available on 1 January 2020. To date, 834 of these acute beds and 73 additional sub-acute beds have been provided under the Winter Plan. Delivery of additional beds and other measures in the Winter Plan is dependent on recruitment of appropriate staff, procurement of IT systems, delivery of physical infrastructure, developing new integrated ways of working and appropriate leadership and governance arrangements.</p>  <p>  At the start of last year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. Funding for a further 40 adult critical care beds was provided on a temporary basis in March 2020 as part of the response to Covid-19 in March 2020.</p>  <p>  A Strategic Plan for Critical Care was noted by Government in December 2020. This Plan aims to increase capacity to 321 by end-2021 and to 446 in the longer term. Funding of &euro;52m provided for 2021 will see the 40 beds provided in 2020 retained permanently and a further 26 added, to bring permanent baseline capacity to 321 by the end of 2021. The HSE has advised that 41 of these 66 beds are now in place, with the number open on any particular day fluctuating as a result of a variety of factors.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided funding for a large increase in the number of healthcare staff employed in the public health service. From the end of 2020 to the end of July 2021, there has been an increase of 4,361 whole-time equivalent healthcare staff, with the largest growth in Nursing and Midwifery (+1,343 WTE). There will be further growth this year, and Budget 2022 will set out the affordable recruitment numbers for 2022 in order to continue to adequately staff the health service.</p>  <p>  As the questions raised by the Deputy relate to operational matters, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the details requested.</p></reply>

That includes where a private company is sold whether within the State or to another company outside the State.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the interpretation and enforcement of data protection law, including in relation to the processing of personal health data associated with genomic or DNA samples, is for the independent Data Protection Commission. It is not something that I, as Minister for Health, can interfere with or involve myself in. However, I can inform the Deputies that matters relating to the sale of bio-samples or personal data related to the samples are matters that fall to be addressed in the informed consent process.</p>  <p>  As I said at the beginning of my answer, my Department has no relationship with the company specified in the Deputies&rsquo; questions. If an agency of the State provided funding to the company then the terms of that funding and any relationship created would be between the agency and the company but under no circumstances could any relationship set aside the provisions of data protection law. Indeed, it would be a serious breach of data protection law and of medical ethics for any hospital to gather genomic and DNA samples and related personal data as part of any relationship other than its relationship with the patient and his or her the care and treatment.</p></reply>

The new plan will continue to be based on the five strategic objectives as outlined in the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, published by the World Health Organization in 2015. </p>  <p>  As with the first Plan, it will be based on the One Health approach, which includes input across the human health, animal health and environment sectors to promote a synergistic response to the challenges presented by Antimicrobial Resistance. The timelines for the development of the second National Action Plan were impacted by the COVID-19 response during 2020. The experiences from the COVID-19 response provided an important context which has now been captured as a key input to the second plan to inform the human health actions. The new Plan will cover the period from this year through to 2025.  </p>  <p>  Antimicrobial Resistance remains a key priority and has been highlighted in National Risk Assessment reports since 2014. The COVID-19 response has provided a unique opportunity to further understand emerging infectious diseases. It has shown a particular role for infection prevention and control, which remains an enabler for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care.  Building on previous investment, significant funding has been provided in both 2020 and 2021 to further the provision of infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship in an integrated way across acute and community health and social care services. This is also in line with the recommendations from the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report. </p>  <p>  Substantial progress has now been made on the development of the Ireland's second National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and my Department is working with One Health stakeholders to finalise and prepare the Plan for publication in the coming months.</p></reply>

This evidence review included a review of relevant studies in relation to Ivermectin. </p><p>As confirmed by HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group, , evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments intended for systemic use, must be subject to the highest standards of rigour. Where a pharmaceutical intervention is recommended in the absence of appropriate supportive evidence, there is a significant potential for harm to the patient. Whereas this risk of harm may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. the intervention poses minimal risk, or the setting involves patients with high potential to gain due to almost certain risk of severe adverse consequences in absence of any intervention) this is less likely to be the case in the setting of mild disease, where a great number of otherwise well patients would potentially receive the intervention. </p><p>HIQA has also advised my Department that several international health technology assessment or guideline development organisations have specifically reviewed the evidence to date on ivermectin in COVID-19 and have cautioned or advised against the use of ivermectin outside the setting of clinical trials on the basis of the current evidence. HIQA has also advised that the pharmaceutical company MSD (Merck, USA), which holds a license in the USA for the use of ivermectin as an antiparasitic agent, on 4 February 2021 published a statement including the following: </p><p><i>&ldquo;</i>It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified: </p> <blockquote> 	No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; <br /><br />No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and; <br /><br />A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.  </blockquote>  <p>We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.&rdquo; </p><p>Further research was undertaken by HIQA and updated advice was provided to the NPHET on 12 May: <i>COVID-19 - Interventions and health related factors that prevent infection or minimise progression to severe disease</i>. This document was subsequently published by HIQA on the 23 June 2021: </p><p> </p><p>One of the key findings of the review was that Ivermectin is not currently licensed for the treatment of COVID-19. From this evidence summary, there is currently insufficient information on whether it can be safely used to prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. Ivermectin should therefore not be used as prophylaxis outside well-designed, regulated clinical trials as the benefits and harms are not yet clear when taken in the context of COVID-19 treatment.</p><p>Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions. However, HIQA noted the low quality of the evidence available including the high risk of bias, small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up, different trials and advised that results from these studies should not be used to inform decision-making with respect to effectiveness. </p><p>HIQA&rsquo;s overall finding was that there is currently insufficient evidence of either effectiveness or safety to support the use of any pharmaceutical intervention outside of well conducted, well-regulated clinical trials. Furthermore, no evidence was identified for the effectiveness or safety of any non-pharmaceutical interventions. </p><p>I trust that the above information satisfactorily addresses your question.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The data requested by the Deputy concerning IPDC &amp;amp; outpatient waiting lists at Beaumont Hospital is outlined in the attached document. This information is also available on the NTPF website at: www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm </p>  <p></p></reply>

The conditions covered by the scheme are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; Parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines. </p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In addition, where an applicant is over the income limit for a medical card, they are also assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Finally, citizens may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyberattack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of persons on waiting lists as inpatients and outpatients, respectively in all departments in University Hospital Waterford is provided in two of the attached documents. Regarding the information requested in respect of cardiac care, the third attached document provides a breakdown of routine and urgent elective cases and procedures.</p>  <p>  NTPF waiting lists are collected in respect of outpatient specialties and inpatient/daycase procedures. Waiting times can be examined in terms of the appointment or procedure that a patient is waiting for, however it is not possible to do so on the basis of clinical diagnosis.</p>  <p> </p>  <p></p>  <p></p></reply>

This provided a comprehensive overview of the proposed project. However, as a project initiated prior to the updated Public Spending Code (PSC), the Project Board is undertaking additional work to ensure full compliance with the new PSC. It will be submitted to the Department, as Approving Authority, and to Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) for technical review in due course.  </p><p>The PSC is designed to ensure that investment decisions are underpinned by a clear policy rationale and that costs are well understood. In 2019, the PSC was updated and introduced a new project lifecycle, tightening the arrangements for project decision-making, and clarifying the roles of the parties involved, including the responsibilities for Sponsoring Agencies and Approving Authorities. </p><p>All capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the new lifecycle approach of the updated PSC, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established.</p><p>The specific requirements that must be included in a business case at the various stages of the PSC, and the stages at which these are to be published, are detailed at </p><p>Whilst the NMH project pre-dates the updated PSC requirements, the PSC requires that so-called &ldquo;legacy projects&rdquo; undergo the same level of scrutiny as new proposals.</p><p>The business case for the relocation of the NMH to Elm Park is well advanced, but is being updated to ensure that it fully complies with all elements required under the updated PSC and by the National Investment Office in D/PER.</p><p>Once the business case has been updated, it will be subject to review in line with the requirements under Decision Gates 1 and 2 of the PSC. This approach is consistent with legacy projects across other areas of Government. </p><p>The Project Board has been working on updating these requirements and an updated business case is expected by the Department in the coming weeks.</p><p>If the technical review considers the business case to be in compliance with the PSC, the project proposal will be submitted to Government for approval-in-principle to progress to the next stage of the PSC. If approved-in-principle is granted to the business case, the project can move to the preparation of tender documents in line with EU Law and deployment of a tendering strategy.</p></reply>

The Standards will be available in early October. </p>  <p>  While these Nutrition Standards recognise that there are instances where the food provided varies due to the location or the nature of the occasion such as field trips and birthday celebrations, they recommend that food provided on these days still needs to comply with the Standards and suggest non-food treats to mark these occasions.  </p>  <p>  In a large service a birthday may be celebrated every couple of days. If children fill up on cakes and treat foods they will have little room left for the nutritious food that they need. It is important to celebrate and mark birthdays and the Standards provide advice on dealing with them. They recommend marking the occasion with fun games and activities rather than foods, and if a parent insists that a cake is sent to the Service they suggest parents are asked to keep it small, keep servings for children to bite size amounts and send leftovers home with the parent. If a number of birthdays fall on the one week, the Standards suggest consider marking them together at one celebration.</p></reply>

The programme is based on the principles of safety, effectiveness and fairness, with the objective of reducing severe illness, hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19 infection.</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The Committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practices in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.</p>  <p>  The NIAC review all data relating to COVID-19 vaccines on a rolling basis. Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the NIAC develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. These guidelines are continuously updated and include guidance on all new vaccines as they are approved for use in Ireland. </p>  <p>  You can read the guidelines at: www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/guidelines/covid19.pdf</p>  <p>  On the 28th of May, the EMA recommended an extension of the use of the Pfizer vaccine to include those aged 12 to 15 years. The EMA subsequently advised an extension of indication for the Moderna vaccine to include use in children aged 12-17 years. The NIAC reviewed these findings and has recommended that vaccination be extended to those aged 12 -15 years, those in this age group will be offered an mRNA vaccination to protect themselves from COVID-19. There are currently no vaccines authorised for use for those aged under 12 years old.</p>  <p>  Clinical trials to assess the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in children under 12 years of age are currently ongoing, with results expected later this year. Vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna are conducting trials in healthy children between the ages of 6 months and 11 years old using lower vaccine doses. Children have different reactions to medications and vaccinations, so conducting clinical trials specific to that population is important to fully understand the benefits and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines in this group. Once the data becomes available, it will be thoroughly reviewed by the European Medicines Agency and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee prior to the vaccines being administered to children under age 12. Non-pharmaceutical interventions including social distancing, hand hygiene, good respiratory etiquette and ventilation, as well as vaccinating as many adults and adolescents as possible will all help lower case rates amongst younger children.</p></reply>

As additional people become eligible for vaccination certificates, certificates are automatically issued after the second vaccination. The Office of Government Chief Information Office (OGCIO) issues certificates based on underlying data provided by the HSE and private test providers. Of course there are a small percentage of the overall number who have yet to receive their vaccination certificates (less than 0.9 % of all those vaccinated to-date) related to data quality issues. The HSE has multiple data sources for vaccine data (e.g., vaccine portal, GPs, pharmacies, acute settings) and data quality is varied. Extensive data quality work has been undertaken by the HSE to ensure sufficient and fully accurate information is available to support both generation and issuing of the certificate to an individual. The HSE continues to work to resolve outstanding data quality issues in relation to vaccination in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  As decided by Government, the Department of Health has mobilised a DCC contact centre at exceptional pace to manage the required workflows and communications to support citizens who may have queries in relation to Digital COVID Certificates for the purposes of travel. This has required an incredible effort across multiple government agencies to put in place the people, processes and technology required. An interim emergency line was put in place from 13th July in advance of the initial contact service going live on the 19th July given the level of public interest as soon as the first certificates began to issue through OGCIO.</p>  <p>  Due to unprecedented demand on the call centre over and above estimates of call centre demand based on an assessment of travel bookings and survey or insights data on travel intentions that Government or industry had access to, several enhancements were accelerated and put in place. The centre ramped up the number of call-handling agents over its initial weeks and stands at 86 agents since the 23rd August. Increased call handling technical capacity was also put in place through a second freephone number on 20th July.</p>  <p>  The call centre also introduced new additional service channels through the launch of online portals to provide additional channels to service queries from members of the public. A new online form to request Recovery certificates for eligible persons was released on 22 July. Following this a portal allowing for Vaccine Certificate Request, Vaccine Certificate Details Update and a Vaccine Status portal were launched on the 30th July. </p>  <p>  The Call Centre continues to work to improve the service and it is expected that a portal to allow citizens with incomplete citizen or vaccine information to provide this data will be launched very shortly to support the HSE gather outstanding data from members of the public who have yet to receive their certificates due to data quality issues. Once a person&rsquo;s identity and eligibility have been verified through this portal, a certificate can issue. Development work is also underway introduce webchat and a last portal to cater for certificate applicants for a DCC who are not resident within Ireland but may be resident on the island of Ireland and third countries.</p></reply>

Non collection of debts owed directly impacts on the affordability of services provided by the Health Service Executive in any year. There are cohorts of people who are exempt from these charges, including, but not limited to persons with full eligibility, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks, children suffering from diseases prescribed under section 52 (2) of the Act, and persons receiving services for the diagnosis or treatment of infectious diseases.</p><p>The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides that all persons ordinarily resident in the country are eligible, subject to the statutory in-patient charge, to public in-patient hospital services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;80 per night, subject to a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of twelve consecutive months. All persons accessing public in-patient services in a public hospital are liable for the statutory public in-patient charge, subject to a number of limited exemptions. There are no immediate plans to review the list of exemptions to this statutory in-patient charge. However, in line with commitments made in the Department of Health Statement of Strategy and the Slaintecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023, a review of the eligibility and charges system is planned. </p><p>The main objective of Sl&aacute;intecare is to provide the right care, at the right place, at the right time. Eligibility and some charges have been highlighted as an obstacle to a patient&rsquo;s access to swift high-quality healthcare. The Sl&aacute;intecare program is committed to addressing any eligibility anomalies through investigating the current eligibility structure. Sl&aacute;intecare&rsquo;s aim is to shift the system to care for those who are in greatest need first.</p></reply>

This guidance came into effect on 19 July. The public health advice is to restore visiting to near normal in terms of frequency of visits in those settings with a high level of vaccination of residents as quickly as possible, while also recognising the need to remain cautious as we continue to deal with the evolving risks associated with COVID-19.</p><p>The new guidance provides that:</p><p>- Providers should put in place the necessary measures to progress to more normalised visiting and visiting frequency as quickly as possible in line with public health guidance with no more than two visitors at any one time. </p><p>- Routine visiting will no longer need to be scheduled in advance. </p><p>- There is no requirement to have a list of nominated visitors. </p><p>- The duration of the visit should not be limited. </p><p>- Fewer restrictions will apply to residents going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home.</p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. In a broad sense, visits to nursing homes are governed by legislation under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013; regulation 11 provides that the nursing home should facilitate visiting and not restrict visiting except in circumstances such as the resident requesting same, or potential risk posed from visiting &ndash; this aligns with the risk assessments referred to in the visiting guidance.  The regulations also require that the nursing home has suitable facilities in place and available for residents to receive visits. It is the legal responsibility of each provider to assess the risks and mitigation measures associated with their service and how best to manage visits having regards to the specific circumstances that arise in relation to their service. The HPSC has developed public health guidance, mentioned above, to assist and support providers in this regard.</p><p>Notwithstanding the current positive epidemiological outlook and the cautious reopening of society, risks continue to remain and emergent risks such as variants of concern present ongoing challenges and the need for vigilance. Visiting arrangements should continue to take account of general public health advice and the necessary infection prevention and control measures, to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities. This is particularly important in the context of the increasing prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant. This new variant poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.</p><p>Visitors are reminded of their responsibilities with regard to self-checks for COVID-19 in advance of visits, infection and prevention control and social interaction with all individuals, while in the nursing home.</p><p>Communications have been issued by Minister Butler emphasising the need for service providers to follow the guidance and the issue of visits continues to be monitored by HIQA as requested by Minister Butler.</p><p>The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges.</p></reply>

It will be important to consider all possible policy tools in this area, including design guidance, and the particular needs associated with different medical conditions. I have also met with Minister Burke in the Department of Housing, and with the HSE, to discuss these issues, and this engagement is ongoing.

HIQA also submitted a paper to the Department outlining a number of suggested amendments to the legislation governing the operation of designated centres for older people.   </p>  <p>  Having regard to the NHEP recommendations, learning from the pandemic and HIQA's suggested regulatory enhancements, Minster Donnelly and I approved a two-phased approach to examining the legislation with a view to proposing enhancements to the primary and secondary legislation governing nursing homes.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that phase 1 will bring forward interim enhancements to the primary legislative framework to enhance governance and oversight of nursing homes. The proposals will, amongst other things, provide new and enhanced enforcement powers for the Chief Inspector of Social Services, HIQA; reduce timelines and processes for regulatory actions and introduce a new reporting system for the reporting and publication of key operational data to support national planning in an integrated way and improve the information available. In January 2021 the Government approved the inclusion of a Health (Amendment) Bill 2021 on its legislative agenda. It is expected that, subject to Government approval, a draft General Scheme will be published by the end of the year in line with Sl&aacute;intecare commitments, with a Bill and secondary legislation being published next year.  The Department has commenced preliminary consultation with relevant stakeholders on the high-level thematic proposals. </p>  <p>  In addition, secondary legislation will be drafted to enhance the current regulations in relation to a number of areas including infection prevention and control, governance and management and staffing.</p>  <p>  A bilateral project group, established in October 2020 and comprising representatives from the Department and HIQA, is supporting the legislative process.   </p>  <p>  A wider review of the regulatory framework, phase 2, will commence in the second half of 2022, taking into account a programme of longer-term strategic reform considerations arising from inter alia pandemic learning with a view to exploring moving towards a service licensing system. </p>  <p>  As the independent regulator of nursing homes, the Chief Inspector determines the appropriate approach and interventions required to monitor and ensure compliance with the regulatory framework. The Chief Inspector adopts a risk-based approach to regulation, prioritising monitoring, inspection and enforcement, based on the assessment of the risk, including the type of inspection undertaken. The approach to inspections typically includes a mix of announced and unannounced, as required.</p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards. </p>  <p>  HIQA, in discharging its duties, determines through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing homes meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.  HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) recently jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel, although these have been affected by the recent cyberattack on the health system.</p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations. Many of the short and medium-term recommendations have already been implemented.</p>  <p>  At a broader level, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of this impact since the start of the pandemic, with various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons. There has been a very clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves, and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises. Findings of these reports confirm that the very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings.  The reports produced nationally identify findings consistent with international evidence, which have highlighted that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into nursing home depends on the levels of the disease circulating in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community.</p>  <p>  While significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of the vaccination programme, and the current situation in nursing homes is broadly stable, the prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant has rapidly increased in Ireland and this poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.  It must be recognised that the pandemic has not concluded and at this time a priority focus of Government remains on the ongoing management of the COVID-19 response, to ensure that the positive gains now been experienced are preserved, and that those most vulnerable to the virus continue to be safeguarded, having regard to the residual risk.</p>  <p>  The Government is continuing to look at options which may be available to the State in relation to listening to the voices of those who have lost a loved one.</p></reply>

The details of these measures were subsequently outlined in the HSE National Service Plan 2021. In line with existing practice, an element of this funding was held back in the Department of Health.

To date, the HSE has requested &euro;6.93m of this funding, which has been approved.</p>  <p>  In cases where the entire amount of expenditure is not expected by year end, this is largely due once off time related savings, which can be attributed to the following: </p>  <p>  - Recruitment into designated roles, including notice period requirements resulting in actual start dates later than estimated.  </p>  <p>  - Facilities  opening later than the timing assumed when planning the operational funding levels in the Budget due to delays construction timetable. </p>  <p>  - Procurement/negotiation timelines extending longer than originally planned for when setting funding levels.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of the HSE in operationalising the business cases for the new measures announced in Budget 2021, especially taking into account the resources required to manage the public health response to Covid-19.

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment), which was signed into law on 22 July, introduced further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses. It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care.</p>  <p>  Within the NHSS, the asset value of a principal residence is assessed for 3 years, with 7.5% of its value going towards the cost of care. After 3 years on the scheme, the value of the property is no longer assessed. However, under previous rules, if the property was sold, the resulting cash asset was assessable in full for the entire length of stay in care. This could act as a disincentive for those who might otherwise consider selling their homes. The 2021 Act now extends the 3-year cap to cover the proceeds of sale, so that a person who sells their home will not see an increase in their contributions.

Currently passengers travelling into Ireland who have valid proof of being vaccinated with an authorised vaccination are not required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine. Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance. </p><p>There are 4 European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved vaccines currently accepted in Ireland, each of which have specific definitions for when a person is considered fully vaccinated. The following table outlines the definition of &lsquo;fully vaccinated&rsquo; in order to qualify for an exemption from mandatory hotel quarantine. <table>    <tr>       <th>A full course of any one of the following vaccines  </th>       <th>Regarded as fully vaccinated after  </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 doses of Pfizer-BioNtech Vaccine: BNT162b2 (Comirnaty&reg;)  </td>       <td>7 days  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 doses of Moderna Vaccine: CX-024414 (Moderna&reg;)  </td>       <td>14 days  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca Vaccine: ChAdOx1-SARS-COV-2 (Vaxzevria&reg; or Covishield)  </td>       <td>15 days  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 dose of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson/Janssen Vaccine: Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant] (Janssen&reg;) </td>       <td>14 days </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>‎At present, the Sinovac vaccine has not received EMA approval. As of 07 September 2021, no appeals to mandatory hotel quarantine have been granted on the basis of persons being fully vaccinated with Sinovac.  Similarly, there are no discretions applied to the quarantine period for persons vaccinated with Sinovac.</p><p>Neither myself as Minister for Health or my Department have any role in deciding which persons must enter mandatory quarantine or which persons are exempt from entering mandatory quarantine. All such decisions are to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p></reply>

Following Minister Harris' commitment to review the regulations on foot of the Deputy's query in 2019, Department officials contacted the HIA in respect of the clause pertaining to coverage of public hospitals. The HIA advised that their reviews included consideration of this issue and they are satisfied that there should be no change to this provision of the regulations. This position has become more relevant with the introduction of Sl&aacute;intecare which aims to exclude all private practice from public hospitals. These matters are being kept under review by the HIA and Department officials on an ongoing basis and in line with government policy on healthcare and health insurance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-09a.3984.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021090900072#WRUUU05300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1387 and 1388 together.</p><p>Enabling people with care-needs to continue to live independently at home for as long as possible is a priority for the Government. To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.</p><p>Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery. </p><p>With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. </p><p>On 27 April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. </p><p>In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.</p><p>Mobilisation of the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery is expected to commence in September, supported by the National Office. The pilot will deliver an additional 230,000 hours of home-support in four community healthcare network (CHN) sites over a six-month period. In addition, approximately 130 posts have been funded for the national rollout of the interRAI Ireland system, which the home-support pilot will test as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.</p><p>The <i>Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023</i>commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the <i>Programme for Government</i>commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services.</p></reply>

Accordingly, we have established a Contraception Implementation Group, which held its first meeting on the 28th July and will oversee implementation of the Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>In the meantime, access to free contraception is already enabled to some contexts, through the National Condom Distribution Service (NCDS), which was established by the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) in October 2015.</p><p>The NCDS functions as a central point for distributing free condoms and lubricant sachets to HSE services and other organisations working with individuals and groups at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes. The NCDS was expanded to 3<sup>rd</sup>level campuses in 2019 and will continue to operate in this context as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted and students return to in-person tuition.</p><p>It should also be noted that those with a GMS (medical) card already have access to most forms of contraception free of charge. Those with a GP visit card are supported to some extent as the clinical cost element of contraception is reduced. The Drugs Payment Scheme, for which anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland is eligible, covers the cost of prescription items above a limit of &euro;114 per month. </p><p>However, I am very conscious that, for those who do not qualify for a medical card, cost can be a barrier to accessing their preferred or most appropriate form of contraception.  As such, Minister Donnelly, myself and our Department remain committed to providing free contraception over a phased period, starting with women aged 17-25, as set out in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the current Programme for Government, the new policy,<i>Sharing the Vision - A Mental Health Policy for Everyone</i>, and the significant additional funding given to HSE Mental Health services in Budget 2021. </p><p>2021 saw a record budget for mental health of over &euro;1.1 billion, including &euro;23 million to commence implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of <i>Sharing the Vision</i>in 2021 and the HSE National Service Plan. I am committed to ensuring that Budget 2022 builds on this progress.  </p><p>While there is no doubt that Covid-19 has posed significant challenges, including isolation, bereavement, anxiety and loss of income and work for many, we do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health and subsequent demand on services.  A negative mental health outcome from the pandemic is not inevitable, if we respond in a cohesive manner. </p><p>Since the pandemic started, mental health services have responded rapidly, continuing to deliver supports in the safest possible way throughout the country. 2021 also saw an additional &euro;15 million allocated for measures in response to Covid-19 enabling the HSE and the Department to continue to plan for any surge in demand for mental health services and supports as it arises. The HSE have service surge capacity plans in place, including access to acute beds in the private sector. </p><p>The HSE has a range of proactive responses for any rise in mental health service needs, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports. In 2020, an additional &euro;2.2 million was allocated to develop telehealth and psychosocial responses to Covid-19. Telehealth services are now fully established while the HSE Psychosocial Framework, published in January 2021, provides a cohesive, coordinated, consistent and collaborative whole-of-population approach to the provision of mental health services and supports. </p><p>My Department is engaging in dialogue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Health Service Executive in relation to the 2021 Estimates. Until these discussions are concluded it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this matter</p></reply>

It is anticipated that immunisations will begin in early October and will be available free of charge to adults in specified at-risk groups and children aged from 2 to 17 years of age.</p>  <p>  The plan will build on the significant resources put in place under the winter plan for 20/21 which provided additional permanent acute bed capacity, additional home support hours, additional community-based services and an expanded flu vaccination programme to alleviate pressure on hospital emergency departments (EDs) and targeted initiatives to address population health needs which combine the need to shift care to home and ambulatory care environments, especially for high-risk cohorts such as elderly patients and those with chronic illnesses.</p></reply>

The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;80 per night, subject to a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of twelve consecutive months. All persons accessing public in-patient services in a public hospital are liable for the statutory public in-patient charge, subject to a number of limited exemptions which include; </p><p>- medical card holders; </p><p>- people receiving treatment for prescribed infectious diseases - including Coronavirus (Covid-19); </p><p>- people who are subject to 'long-stay' charges; </p><p>- children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school board examinations; </p><p>- people who are eligible for hospital services because of EU Regulations;</p><p>- women receiving maternity services; </p><p>- children up to 6 weeks of age; </p><p>- people with hepatitis C who have a Health Amendment Card; </p><p>- people who are part of the Redress Scheme for Women Resident in Certain Institutions.</p><p>Patient charges are a key element of the overall funding envelope of the Irish health system and are taken into account when agreeing the Annual Estimates and the subsequent preparation of the annual National Service Plan.</p><p>There are no immediate plans to review the list of exemptions to this statutory in-patient charge. However, in line with commitments made in the Department of Health Statement of Strategy and the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023, a review of the eligibility and charges system is planned. </p><p>The main objective of Sl&aacute;intecare is to provide the right care, at the right place, at the right time. Eligibility and some charges have been highlighted as an obstacle to a patient&rsquo;s access to swift high-quality healthcare. The Sl&aacute;intecare program is committed to addressing any eligibility anomalies through investigating the current eligibility structure. Sl&aacute;intecare&rsquo;s aim is to shift the system to care for those who are in greatest need first.</p></reply>

Visiting arrangements should continue to take account of general public health advice and the necessary infection prevention and control measures, to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities. This is particularly important in the context of the increasing prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant. This new variant poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.</p><p>Visitors are reminded of their responsibilities with regard to self-checks for COVID-19 in advance of visits, infection and prevention control and social interaction with all individuals, while in the nursing home.</p><p>I have recently communicated with all nursing homes in Ireland, advising them of the current guidelines. </p><p>The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges</p></reply>

Women&rsquo;s health is a priority for this Government, as outlined in the programme for Government and since the emergence of this matter, the ongoing priority focus for the Department and the HSE has been to meet the care needs of women experiencing mesh complications. Women affected by mesh continue to be strongly encouraged to engage with the relevant HSE contact points and the associated care pathways, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. </p>  <p>  Considerable work has been done and continues to progress in Ireland in relation to the safe use of mesh implants and ensuring that all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, multidisciplinary and patient-centred care is a priority. </p>  <p>  Multidisciplinary specialist services are available for women suffering from mesh complications through a National Specialist Centre which has been developed over two sites at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin and these have received specific funding from the HSE for the provision of these services.  Both centres currently treat women suffering with post-mesh complications and have been accepting referrals from the national pathway since it was set up in November 2018. </p>  <p>  The HSE has created a dedicated web page about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information regarding the pathways for women suffering complications. Full details of mesh removal services and contact information for relevant hospitals are available on the HSE website at www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-infants/vaginal-mesh-implants/.    </p>  <p>  As this Parliamentary Question also relates to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This estimate also assumes a full year testing and tracing programme of the type that currently exists and does not take in to account any changes which might arise in adapting the programme to expected changing circumstances (such as, for example, as might be expected over the course of the evolving and changing pandemic and considerations such as the broader management of other infectious diseases.) The estimate assumes a consistent rate of testing over the full year period although this is unlikely (and depends on future epidemiological situation, transmissibility of the dominant variant, the nature and location of infections, the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing transmission, public health guidance and measures in place etc). The estimate also assumes that variable costs are consistent across the period although this is also unlikely (e.g. staffing, transport, rent and fit-out, procurement costs etc). Fixed costs are assumed to be similar to present and no estimate of any changes is included and, again, it is likely that maintenance and location of testing centres will evolve over the coming year. </p>  <p>  In keeping with the evolving nature of the pandemic, the Deputy may also wish to note the transitionary approach to testing and tracing highlighted in the Government's recently published plan for the next phase of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, "COVID-19: Reframing the challenge, Continuing our recovery and reconnecting&rdquo;. </p></reply>

The HSE has advised that a new critical care bed will typically cost between &euro;1m and &euro;1.5m, depending on a variety of factors, including design, construction, equipping and all other associated capital costs. The HSE has advised that the average annual cost of running a critical care bed is estimated to be &euro;747k, based on 2018 data. However, it should be noted that this figure includes costs for both ICU and HDU beds, with the ICU beds the more expensive of the two.  </p>  <p>  A Strategic Plan for Critical Care was noted by Government in December 2020. This Plan aims to increase capacity from a baseline of 255 to 446 over time, fully addressing the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review. As the first phase of implementation, funding of &euro;52m was provided in 2021 to allow for the permanent retention of the 40 beds temporarily funded in 2020, plus an additional 26 beds as referenced by the Deputy. Of these, the HSE has advised that the six beds in UHL were opened in the first half of this year, with the beds at the Mater and Tallaght hospitals due to open in Q42021/Q12022 on completion of capital works.

Unfortunately, due COVID-19 restrictions I haven&rsquo;t been able to engage with people on the pierside.  In order to interact directly with members of coastal communities, during the month of May 2021, I held a series of virtual Townhall meetings with coastal communities around Ireland.  These virtual meetings allowed me to hear directly from those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit and to hear their ideas about the future of their communities.</p>  <p>  At these meetings, I gave an overview of the key issues that have faced the Fishing Industry since I took office, namely Brexit and COVID-19.  I noted that the industry had worked with their counterparts in other Member States to assist in the development of a strong Irish position for EU negotiations. I also noted the additional burden on Ireland in respect of the transfer of quotas under the TCA which I am working to address. </p>  <p>  I also took the opportunity to acknowledge the work of the seafood sector throughout the disruptions caused by COVID-19.

I am in regular and intensive consultation with all stakeholders, and it is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy. </p>  <p>  The delays that have arisen were caused by changes to the licensing system which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input to comply with environmental requirements. To find solutions towards resolving these issues, as well as focusing on woodland creation, Project Woodland was initiated early in 2021. </p>  <p>  It comprises four working groups, each with an independent chair and with members drawn from forestry and eNGO stakeholders on the Forestry Policy Group. The Project Board, chaired by Secretary General of my Department, published its first Interim Report in July and the  Project Manager has published the Project Charter which details project management oversight.</p>  <p>  As part of Project Woodland, a tender has recently issued to source legal and environmental expertise to carry out an in-depth review of the forestry licensing system. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licencing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. </p>  <p>  The business systems analysis currently being undertaken by an independent systems analyst will interact with and run parallel with the regulatory review, so that best possible system improvements are delivered.</p>  <p>In June this year, the Department issued 415 forestry licences. This output  was interrupted in July and August by the introduction of a new requirement for public participation under SI 293/2021, signed on 25th   June  by the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and  which applies to all similar planning issues. However last week licences returned  to expected levels with 110 new licences issued of which 92 were felling licences, with 41 private, and we expect this increased output to continue through to the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In terms of supply to the building industry, Coillte who account for around 75% of total sawlog to sawmills, have been fully licensed  for 2021.  We are still working through the backlog of private felling licences, and with a dedicated team in place and the system improvements introduced, we expect  recent private felling  licence output to be maintained.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.</p></reply>

Although the pace of deterioration accelerated in 2020, there are encouraging signs as the current 12-month rolling herd incidence at 29<sup>th</sup>August 2021 is 4.16% compared to 4.22% on 30<sup>th</sup>August 2020. The overall number of new herds restricted at 29<sup>th</sup>August 2021 is 2,879 compared to 3,033 on 30<sup>th</sup>August 2020 while the overall number of reactors at 29<sup>th</sup>August 2021 is 13,092 compared to 14,431 on 30<sup>th</sup>August 2020. If downward momentum can be maintained, it can give a sense of progress achieved by the renewed TB Strategy launched in January 2021.</p><p>The reasons for increase in disease over the last number of years are multifactorial and often relate to a combination of national and local factors. </p><p>The expansion of the dairy herd since 2015 has played a role in this, since dairy herds, larger herds, farm fragmentation and herds which introduce more cattle are all more at risk of TB breakdowns. Wildlife is also a factor.</p><p>The causes for the outbreaks of TB cases across the country within each county are various and require a range of actions to address the problem. </p><p>Within each county the TB programme focuses on wildlife, how disease is distributed in the area, contiguous programmes, gamma interferon testing, cleansing and disinfection, testing compliance and frequency and isolation of reactors. </p><p>Each TB outbreak is investigated by a veterinary inspector to identify the source of infection. In the case of every outbreak involving two or more standard reactors, there is a veterinary visit to advise the herdowner on how to eliminate infection and necessary measures to assist in reducing the risk of recurrence.</p><p>&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2021-09-09_pq152709092021_en.xlsx&quot;&amp;gt;number of herds experiencing a new restriction, due to bovine TB&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</p></reply>

To enable staff to work from home during the course of the pandemic, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine equipped staff with IT hardware and software including laptops, phones and software licences. The total spend on this to support remote working is in the region of &euro;1M, which includes devices purchased for new hires since March 2020, as well as costs that were budgeted for computer device replacements. These purchases will continue to be used as the staff&rsquo;s primary computer and communications devices, in-line with the  Department&rsquo;s strategy to enable the future of blended working.</p>  <p>  As we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, the Department will facilitate a meaningful transition back to the normal place of work, particularly for staff who have been working from home for the majority of the period in question. This will involve a gradual phased return of staff to the workplace and will be done in accordance with prevailing public health advice. This transition phase will involve for many staff a blend of remote working and attendance in the workplace. </p>  <p>  A central policy framework for blended working in the civil service will be finalised in conjunction with employee representatives in the course of the coming months. This framework will inform the development of organisation-level blended working policies, tailored to the specific requirements of each Department/Office, whilst ensuring a consistency of approach across key policy areas. </p>  <p>  Following the transition phase out of the current COVID-19 related arrangements, it is intended that the Department will introduce a blended working policy in April 2022, in line with the timeframe agreed by Government. The purpose of this Departmental policy will be to facilitate an element of remote working, in tandem with attendance at the workplace, within a formalised structure which supports the business needs of the Department. Staff will be entitled to apply for blended working, and all applications will be considered bearing in mind the suitability of the applicant and the role for blended working arrangements, as well as the needs of the relevant team and business area.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the development of the policy and this will continue to involve significant and appropriate consultation with key stakeholders, including staff, unions and management, prior to agreement, publication and implementation. Engagement with state agencies under the aegis of DAFM has been ongoing with a view to facilitating a broad consistency of approach, and this engagement will continue to be maintained.</p></reply>

In the four years of the scheme to date, &euro;66.9 million has been paid to 18,268 farmers.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to be able to secure funding as part of Budget 2021 to facilitate the extension of the scheme into 2021 prior to the next CAP.  Any further extension to the scheme for 2022 will be considered as part of the budgetary process in October.</p>  <p>  The existing payment rate of &euro;10 per eligible breeding ewe set under the current scheme was based on an assessment of the costs incurred and income foregone for the menu of actions set out under the scheme.  These were agreed with the Commission when designing the scheme and as such, it is not proposed to amend the payment rates under the scheme at this point.</p>  <p>  With regard to the new CAP, officials in the Department have been examining options to build on the existing Sheep Welfare Scheme. It is important to note that any such scheme must operate on the basis of specific actions to enhance animal health and welfare being carried out, with funding on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone, as is the case with the current scheme. The Department is working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide indicative funding for co-financing of the rural development aspects of the CAP Strategic Plan (CSP). A public consultation on the draft interventions proposed for the CSP has recently ended and the submissions received are being reviewed. I will continue to consult on the content of the plan with the key stakeholders, through the CAP Consultative Committee and through additional public consultation later in the year. </p>  <p>   Both I and the Government support the long-term development and viability of our sheep sector.</p></reply>

The new Forestry Programme will be the enabler of the short term goals of this new Forest Strategy and it will be the successor to the current Forestry Programme which is in place until the end of 2022.</p><p>Substantial work is under way on all the activities recommended by Jo O&rsquo;Hara in her report. The first Project Woodland Project Board Interim Report submitted by the Project Board to my colleague Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector,  was published on 1<sup>st</sup>July 2021. The interim report is available for download from my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/642e6-forestry/#project-woodland</i>) and sets out progress on work undertaken by the Working Groups. The report also provides an overview on decisions taken by the Project Board to date. For example, the Project Board has agreed to advance two Working Group recommendations immediately: an external regulatory review and the conducting of a public consultation process on the new Forest Strategy.</p><p>Matters, such as payment for eco systems services in recognition of the range of the environmental services provided by forests, the removal of restrictions on planting productive marginal land, grant and premium structures, and support to producer groups will be part of the discussions that will take place as part of the development of the new Forest Strategy and Forestry Programme. There will be opportunity for all interested stakeholders to contribute to this process as part of the public consultation process.</p><p>In relation to Producer Groups, I would like to highlight a finding from the Mid-term review of the current Forestry Programme which found that that there are sufficient producer groups in place throughout the country and that there may be a requirement to amalgamate existing groups.</p></reply>

The results of this review were notified to registered foresters by circular in June.  This Circular emphasised the provision of a harvest plan in support of a felling  application and  advised that a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) should only be provided when requested.  </p>  <p>  While not mandatory, a harvest plan is recommended.  It is straightforward for a registered forester to produce and can be prepared as part of the examination of a site for a forestry licence application.  A forester will usually prepare a harvest plan as part of the contract for services, that may include the felling and sale of the timber, and there would be no additional cost on the forest owner.</p></reply>

Corporate and public procurement policies worldwide are driving growth in demand for credibly certified materials.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s entire Coillte forest estate is certified to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification ( PEFC) standards.  Certification in the private forest estate is low by comparison and only a small number of privately owned forests are FSC and or PEFC certified. </p><p>In order to help forest owners to certify their forests, the Department funded a pilot Certification Scheme which was completed successfully in 2018. Two groups were funded under this pilot Certification Scheme and both received certification at the time. </p><p>To facilitate forest owners in the certification process this funded project provided a wide range of standard templates and information which is available to download from the publicly accessible web page at the following link; </p><p><i>www.groupcertification.ie/resources</i>.</p><p>While forest certification is a voluntary matter for forest owners, it is desirable that there would be an increased uptake from growers and support and involvement of all stakeholders. </p><p>Forest Certification is also assisted by my Department through the funding of Forest Management Plans for grant aided forests which is an important prerequisite during the independent certification process.  </p><p>In addition, COFORD via my Department has commissioned a study on private forest certification in Ireland which is currently in the process of being carried out. The study involves  engagement with stakeholders. This study will be made available once published later this year. </p><p>The Department has also approved funding to PEFC Ireland to part-fund the establishment of a working group comprised of industry stakeholders, in order to review the PEFC Irish Forest Certification Standard and the PEFC Ireland Scheme for sustainable Forest Management. </p><p>All these initiatives by the Department recognise the importance of forest certification and complement other licensing requirements which demonstrate sustainable forest management.</p></reply>

I know too that afforestation  is key to meeting our environmental objectives under the Climate Action Plan and in terms of biodiversity, as outlined in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The delays that have arisen were caused by changes to law and relevant court judgements which have required us to radically amend our licencing procedures. To find solutions towards resolving these issues, as well as focussing on woodland creation, Project Woodland was initiated early in 2021. It comprises four working groups, each with an independent chair and with members drawn from forestry and eNGO stakeholders on the Forestry Policy Group. The Project Board, led by Secretary General of the Department, meets regularly to monitor the progress of the working groups and a Project Manager has been assigned.</p>  <p>  As part of Project Woodland, a tender has recently issued to source legal and environmental expertise to carry out an in-depth review of the forestry licensing system. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licencing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. </p>  <p>  The business systems analysis currently being undertaken by an independent systems analyst will interact with and run parallel with the regulatory review, so that best possible system improvements are delivered. </p>  <p>  Alongside Project Woodland, the Department continues to look at system improvements which will increase processing time. A recent improvement introduced in the preparation of the various Appropriate Assessment documents have allowed for output improvements. These improvements have been rolled out to forest road licences and will shortly apply to afforestation.  </p>  <p>  On afforestation, forestry licences are valid for three years and at present there are 5,700ha of approved forestry ready to plant.  The planting season normally runs from October to May annually.  The Department has also assigned additional resources to afforestation licencing to increase output for the planting season this year.</p>  <p>In June this year, the Department issued 415 forestry licences. This output was interrupted in July and August by the introduction of a new requirement for public participation under SI 293/2021, signed on 25th June by the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and which applies to all similar planning issues. However, last week licences returned  to expected levels with 110 new licences issued and we expect this increased output to continue through to the end of the year. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.</p></reply>

The ambition is to ensure Irish farmers are empowered to purchase medicines from their supplier of choice. Initiatives such as the development of a National Veterinary Prescribing System (NVPS) will help deliver on this ambition. The NVPS will result in a prescription being made available to a farmer by choice of email, text or in paper. Farmers can then engage with Licensed Merchants, veterinary pharmacists or their veterinary practitioner in getting their prescription dispensed. </p><p>Negotiations on Regulation 2019/6 were finalised in early 2019. At that time, antiparasitic veterinary medicines could be supplied in Ireland without the requirement for a veterinary prescription. Therefore, in the course of negotiations on the Regulation, there was no rationale for Ireland to seek a  derogation permitting persons other than veterinary practitioners to issue veterinary prescriptions for these medicines. Following the coming into force of Regulation 2019/6 in January 2019, a Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) Expert Task Force undertook a review of antiparasitic veterinary medicines which confirmed that they no longer met the exemption criteria in EU law which permitted them to be supplied without a veterinary prescription. These conclusions were issued in a report in December 2019 and is available here <i></i>.</p><p>As a result, under EU law antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products must be upregulated to Prescription Only Medicine (POM) in Ireland from January 2022.</p></reply>

There  is a proven link between TB infection in badgers and bovine TB.</p><p>Badger culling has been demonstrated to be highly effective in reducing the burden of bovine TB on Irish family farms for over 20 years. However, DAFM is currently committed to reducing badger culling in favour of badger vaccination which is more sustainable in the long term for both ecological and disease reasons, in line with the Programme for Government commitment. This is possible because badger vaccination has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing badger to badger TB transmission and not to be inferior to badger culling when introduced to areas with low badger densities and reduced prevalence of TB.</p><p>The current policy is to vaccinate badgers to prevent disease outbreaks and to cull badgers where necessary in response to outbreaks in areas where epidemiological investigations have demonstrated the link between badgers and TB breakdowns on cattle farms. Areas where badger culling may previously have taken place are being incorporated into the badger vaccination programme on an ongoing basis but only when any underlying disease spread to cattle from wildlife has been suppressed.</p><p>Since the commencement of badger vaccination in 2018, 19,079 Km2 of land has been switched to vaccination on a phased basis and this will continue. The scientific evidence for the efficacy of badger culling is well established and the evidence to support badger vaccination within the TB eradication scheme is being added to on an ongoing basis as additional research is published in peer reviewed scientific journals. DAFM is currently collaborating with University College Dublin and the University of Waginengen to validate the efficacy of vaccination in the field and to model where higher risks exist at a local farm level which will support better targeting of TB controls in future years.</p><p>As the level of badger vaccination increases, it is expected that there will be fewer wildlife driven TB outbreaks in cattle and thus less need for badger culling. It is likely, however, that some level of badger culling will remain necessary until TB levels have significantly reduced.</p><p>DAFM provides advice to farmers on how to reduce the risk of TB from wildlife which can be accessed at; <i>www.bovinetb.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The scheme in 2021 is an annual scheme as was the scheme in 2020 and the pilot in 2019.</p>  <p>  Applications for BEEP-S 2021 were made via the Department's online application system at www.agfood.ie.  The scheme opened for applications on 16th  March 2021 and the closing date for receipt of applications was Monday 26th April 2021.  There was a 25 calendar day period after the closing date for the acceptance of late applications. </p>  <p>  As with many payment schemes that are applied for on-line and administered by the Department,  applicants may lodge the application themselves or alternatively they may authorise an agent to lodge the application on their behalf.  </p>  <p>  The Department issued two Press Releases on 16th March and 13th April 2021 on the BEEP-S and Dairy Beef schemes for 2021. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department issued five text reminders regarding BEEP-S to those who are registered to receive texts from the Department. The first two texts went to just over 107,000 people on each occasion while the fourth text on 21st April 2021 went to just over 8,000 farmers who were participants in the 2020 BEEP-S but who, as of that date, had not yet applied for BEEP-S 2021.</p>  <p>  The person named had not opted to receive texts from the Department and therefore the Department was precluded from sending communications to him by text.  </p>  <p>  There is no record of any attempt to create or lodge a BEEP-S 2021 application in respect of the named person. The Department received correspondence requesting a review of the non-submission of a BEEP-S application in July 2021 and again in August, 2021. Officials responded to both letters in July and August, 2021 with the August letter advising of the right to appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office.</p></reply>

The North East RIFF is part of the network of six Regional Forums around the coast that support the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF). The National and Regional Forums are consultative bodies, established to foster industry-led development of proposals for the management of non-quota stocks within six nautical miles of the Irish shore. Since their inception, the Forums have developed initiatives seeking to protect the future of the inshore sector, which is extremely important for Irish coastal communities. The Forums involve representation from inshore fishers, environmental interests, marine leisure, marine tourism and other marine stakeholders. A dedicated website provides information on the work of the Forums: www.inshoreforums.ie.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish fishing industry has several Producer Organisations, including the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation (KFO), the Irish Fish Producers Organisation (IFPO), the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (ISWFPO), the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation (ISEFPO) and the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation (IIMRO). Seafood processors are represented by the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association (IFPEA). All of these are national groups and cover, as appropriate, operators in County Louth. The Clogherhead Fishermen&rsquo;s Co-operative also  is based in County Louth.</p></reply>

On land use and deforestation, it notes that the overall trade-induced impacts from the Agreement are projected to be marginal and, as a result, land use intensity in Mercosur is also expected to increase slightly by up to 1%, driven mainly by grains, vegetable and fruit production. </p>  <p>  The agreement includes a detailed chapter on Sustainable Development, and recognises the need to address the urgent threat of climate change and the role that trade has in this regard. It also underscores the importance of both Parties implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement. The ESIA confirms this, and highlights an explicit mechanism whereby concerns can be raised about environmental and labour conditions on a bilateral basis in a manner that is transparent and subject to public accountability. </p>  <p>  I believe it is critical that these environmental provisions are strictly adhered to for the agreement to progress. I also note that additional text to the Agreement on climate and deforestation is currently being negotiated to strengthen these provisions. The Government, including my Department, is inputting to these discussions at EU level. It makes no logical or moral sense for the Mercosur bloc to be allowed to flout environmental conditions when countries like Ireland play such a leadership role in this space.</p></reply>

I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 transposing the UTP Directive into Irish law on 28th April 2021, ahead of the EU deadline of 1st May 2021.

The Enforcement Authority has the power to investigate complaints from suppliers, including primary producers, carry out investigations on its own initiative and initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the UTPs.  </p><p>I have recently appointed authorised officers to the Authority and work is ongoing to develop a communications and awareness-raising campaign which will commence shortly.

There has been a sharp increase in fertiliser prices since the start of this year. The fertiliser market is largely driven by global supply and demand and, while there are a number of factors influencing fertiliser price, the major driving factors for the current increase in prices are increased global demand driven by strong growth in agricultural commodity prices, rising production costs due to increased raw material and energy costs, and issues with supply for certain fertiliser products.</p>  <p>  No fertilisers are manufactured in Ireland, resulting in indigenous fertiliser companies being price-takers, dependent on global supply and demand and subject to Euro exchange rates against the US dollar and other currencies. </p>  <p>  Many farmers purchased their fertiliser earlier this year compared to previous years and were not exposed to recent price increases. However, it is expected that farmers will experience the full effect of higher fertiliser prices for the coming season. Fertiliser prices are projected to remain robust into next year as production is increased in response to rising global demand coupled with higher costs of production. As a key input in the food production system, the Department will be closely monitoring how the fertiliser market develops in the months ahead.</p></reply>

The majority of manufacturers of mineral fertiliser in Ireland market their products in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003. This Regulation ensures that fertiliser products are labelled accurately and meet minimum nutrient requirements. However, current EU and National fertiliser regulations do not require batch numbers and expiry dates to be included on fertiliser products labels. </p>  <p>  A new EU Fertiliser Products Regulation (FPR) (Regulation (EU) 2019/1009) is coming into effect next year. Under the new FPR, manufacturers will be obliged to ensure that the packaging of EU fertilising products bears a type number or a batch number or any other element to allow their identification. </p>  <p>  With regard to the inclusion of expiry dates, there is no requirement to include production or expiry dates for mineral fertiliser products under the FPR. However, the FPR puts in place a conformity assessment system to provide for quality assurance for fertiliser products that are available on the market. This conformity system will ensure that the necessary conformity assessment requirements and procedures have been successfully completed before products are made available and ensures conformity testing of products is performed in a reliable and reproducible manner. </p>  <p>  The FPR will also require the Department to continue to carry out market surveillance activities to ensure that fertiliser products being made available on the market comply with the requirements of the Regulation.</p></reply>

The remit of this Task Force is to examine the implications arising from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the UK for the Irish Fishing industry and coastal communities particularly dependent upon it. I have asked the Task Force to outline initiatives that could be taken to provide supports for development and restructuring so as to ensure a profitable and sustainable fishing fleet and to identify opportunities for jobs and economic activity in coastal communities dependent on fishing.  </p>  <p>  In July 2021, I received an Interim Report of this Task Force which made some limited recommendations pending its full report which I expect to receive in the Autumn.  While the Interim Report did not feature any specific recommendations relating to seafood processing, I understand that the Task Force is including this sector in its examination of the impacts of the TCA.

These Working Groups afford members the opportunity to help shape the Department's response to licensing issues, to voice the concerns of those they represent and to help shape the future of Irish forestry policy. This is a voluntary commitment, which members undertake on behalf of those they represent, and while I very much appreciate their participation, there is no fee paid. This is standard for stakeholder groups engaging with the Department. </p>  <p>  Project Woodland has introduced a framework for examining all aspects of licence delivery, as well as looking to the future of woodland creation. As part of the Project a tender has recently issued to source legal and environmental expertise to carry out an in-depth review of the forestry licensing system. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licencing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. </p>  <p>  The business systems analysis currently being undertaken by an independent systems analyst will interact with and run parallel with the regulatory review, so that best possible system improvements are delivered.</p>  <p>  Alongside Project Woodland, the Department continues to look at system improvements which will increase processing time. A recent improvement introduced in the preparation of the various Appropriate Assessment documents have allowed for increased output and I expect this year's licencing output to be significantly up on last year.</p>  <p>  On afforestation, forestry licences are valid for three years and at present there are 5,700ha of approved forestry ready to plant.  The planting season normally runs from October to May annually.  The Department has also assigned additional resources to afforestation licencing to increase output for the planting season this year.</p>  <p>In June this year, the Department issued 415 forestry licences. This output was interrupted in July and August by the introduction of a new requirement for public participation under SI 293/2021, signed on 25th June  by the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and which applies to all similar planning issues. However, last week licences returned  to expected levels with 110 new licences issued and we expect this increased output to continue through to the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has overall responsibility for the sector, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.</p></reply>

In tonnage terms, this means an increase from 191,843 tonnes to 298,299 tonnes &ndash; an increase of 106,456 tonnes for 2021. The Norwegian decision seeks to increase its share of the North Eastern Mackerel Stock from 22.5% to 35%. The Faroe Islands have since followed suit and also increased their unilateral share by 55%.</p>  <p>  Mackerel has been managed under a UN Coastal States Agreement that involved the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands for the period 2014 to 2020. Iceland had refused to participate in the management agreement and the three parties to the agreement set aside a significant share of the share of the stock (15.6%) to cater for catches by Iceland as well as Greenland and Russia. For 2021, after Brexit and the UK departure from the EU, the parties involved agreed a global Total Allowable Catch level but were unable to agree on a new sharing arrangement.  Consequently, there is currently no Coastal States Agreement on Mackerel in place.  </p>  <p>  While the EU and the UK have an agreed framework for fisheries under the TCA and recently concluded an annual agreement on shared stocks for 2021, there is no such bilateral agreement between Norway (and Faroes) and the UK. This was the justification used by both of these countries for increasing their mackerel share.</p>  <p>  I have consistently made clear that this declaration by Norway and Faroes to hugely increase their mackerel quotas is a direct threat to the sustainability of the overall mackerel fishery and the future of the Irish pelagic fishing industry. There is no justification for this unilateral, opportunistic and unsustainable move.  Both countries are now doing what they have consistently criticised Iceland for doing over the past decade. This is all the more disappointing because it undermines the critically important arrangements for  joint management of mackerel by the Coastal States under the UN structure. As the scientific advice sets the sustainable level of fishing each year on mackerel, an increase by Norway means either the stock is overfished or other parties must take a smaller share. Neither option is acceptable.</p>  <p>  Under the EU /UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, there will be a 26% reduction in the Irish mackerel quota within the EU by 2026, with 60% of this reduction applied in 2021. Mackerel remains Irelands most important fishery with a quota for 2021 of 60,849 tonnes valued at approximately &euro;80m and it underpins the important Irish pelagic fish processing industry in the North West. Ireland is the largest Mackerel quota holder in the EU.  </p>  <p>  I have called on EU Commissioner Sinkevicius to reject completely this unilateral action by Norway to claim a much higher share of the mackerel stock.  I wrote to him to ask him to respond without delay to this provocative and irresponsible action and to pursue actions available to the European Commission to protect the important EU mackerel fleets and mackerel processing industry. It is vital that the EU Commissioner takes urgent steps to counteract this irresponsible action by Norway. Norway must understand that responsible partners do not get rewarded for such unacceptable action.</p>  <p>  Our mackerel fishers have already taken unacceptable cuts to their share of the mackerel stock under the EU/UK TCA.  I am working with them to pursue all avenues to deliver a more equitable burden sharing within the EU.  I am very concerned that this action by Norway will add further uncertainty to the mackerel industry already trying to adjust to reduce quotas after Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Access to harbours is not covered under Coastal States Fisheries agreements.   Direct landings by non EU vessels are regulated under both North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission Port State Control rules and Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fisheries legislation.  Landings by Third country vessels can only take place in EU ports that have been designated specifically for this purpose and must fulfil all regulatory requirements including relevant documentation and prior notification.    Ireland currently has two fully designated ports &ndash; Killybegs, Co. Donegal, and Castletownbere, Co. Cork with five other designated ports for landings by Northern Ireland vessels.</p></reply>

The other five are located at Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East, Howth and Killybegs.  Funding is made available on an annual basis by the Department to the Fishery Harbour Centres, including Ros an Mh&iacute;l, via the Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme.</p>  <p>  The possibility of a deep-water berthing project at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC has been mooted for some time, as of yet no decision has been made to invest in its development.  Any decision to decide to proceed to a detailed design phase of such a project would be predicated on an overall decision to proceed with the project as a whole.</p>  <p>  The Department took the prudent step to review the Wave Modelling studies previously carried out in 2002 to ensure that the analysis takes account of both the revised Quay Development layout and the influence of climate change on wave models affecting the FHC.  Separately the Department has also commissioned a review of the Cost Benefit Analysis Report previously carried out by DKM Economic Consultants Ltd in 2017, again incorporating the revised Quay Development layout.  Both studies are obviously interlinked in that the Wave Modelling outcome will likely influence the Cost Benefit Analysis and final reports are expected in November/December 2021.</p>  <p>As is the case regarding developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres generally, any future decision on a possible deep-water berthing project in Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC, will only be considered on the basis of available Exchequer funding and competing national priorities.  </p></reply>

The townhall webinars were also well attended with in excess of 300 attending on each of the three nights.  These submissions are under consideration and will be taken on board in the development of the plan.  </p>  <p>  Discussions with key stakeholders will continue through bilateral engagements, and through the CAP Consultative Committee, where all key stakeholders are represented.  A statutory consultation on draft environmental report for the CAP Strategic Plan will be held in November with the final plan due for submission in December in advance of the 1st January 2022 deadline.  </p>  <p>  The plan will then be subject to an approval process with the Commission over a six or eight month period.  All elements of the plan will be subject to review and scrutiny by the EU Commission in line with the relevant regulatory framework around the three general objectives of economic, environmental and social sustainability. The CAP Strategic Plan will commence on 1st January 2023. </p>  <p>  As discussed during the public consultation process with respect to the Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme, the rationale for the proposed inclusion of the limit on herd expansion in participant herds in the context of this scheme is to ensure that participants do not increase their overall bovine animal emissions while participating in the voluntary environmental programme.</p>  <p>  In relation to rewetting, the All-of-Government Climate Action Plan 2019 targets 40,000 hectares of reduced management intensity of grasslands on drained organic soils as part of Agriculture&rsquo;s contribution to achieving national climate change targets. Informed by the Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) this rewetting initiative is estimated to contribute 4.4 Mt CO2 eq cumulative abatement over the period 2021 to 2030.</p>  <p>  Teagasc&rsquo;s calculations use Tier 1 values from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They include direct CO2 emissions, offsite CO2 emissions from Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) in drainage water, methane emissions from both soils and open drainage ditches, as well as direct N2O emissions from soils. </p>  <p>  Most importantly in relation to the question poised in the correspondence referred to by the Deputy, the increased methane emissions associated with re-wetting has been included in the calculations and the balance of emissions still return an overall emissions reduction.</p></reply>

Accordingly, officials at my department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications were tasked with drawing up recommendations for the future direction and composition of a refreshed Taskforce. Their recommendations are being reviewed at present. Once this review has completed, I will discuss options for the future of the Taskforce with my ministerial colleagues.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the completion of the Taskforce&rsquo;s work programme, I have continued to engage regularly with colleagues in Government, both national and local, with State agencies and regional development representatives and with commercial operators on a range of issues relevant to the development of rural connectivity. The lines of communication between former Taskforce members remain open and productive.</p>  <p>  Through various recent schemes, including the recent Digital Innovation Programme, my department continues to encourage deeper collaboration between stakeholders. The rural development policy I launched this year, Our Rural Future, commits to a fully connected and digitally enabled Ireland. To this end I and my officials will continue to engage with the appropriate organisations on a multi-lateral or bi-lateral basis to ensure these commitments are met.</p></reply>

A central policy framework for Blended Working in the Civil Service will be finalised in conjunction with employee representatives over the coming months. This framework will inform the development of organisation level blended working policies tailored to the specific requirements of each Department/Office, whilst ensuring a consistency of approach across key policy areas.</p>  <p>  My Department, like other civil service employers, hopes to transition staff back to the office during September 2021, on a staggered basis. It is intended that the enduring Blending Working policy will come into effect in April 2022. Currently, over 90% of my Department's staff are working either fully remotely or on a hybrid basis, this has been in place since March 2020 in line with public health advice.</p>  <p>  The agencies under the remit of my Department are independent legal entities responsible for managing their own corporate affairs and staff issues in compliance with statutory obligations, including observing public health advice and managing staff attendance patterns in their offices and remotely.</p></reply>

The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans. </p>  <p>  My Department commissioned an external review of the Walks Scheme to examine the delivery and strategic development of the Scheme, and assess the role and resourcing of the Rural Recreation Officer (RRO) posts throughout the country. The reviewers were also required to consider the level of funding provided to the Local Development Companies to deliver the scheme.  The recommendations contained in the review will inform decisions on the further strategic expansion of the scheme, including the resourcing of Local Development Companies.  </p>  <p>  West Cork Development Partnership has two very significant trails funded under the Walks Scheme &ndash; the Beara Way and the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Way. There are almost 580 landholders funded under these two walks receiving funding of about &euro;650,000. West Cork Development Partnership also receives funding for one full-time equivalent RRO position.</p>  <p>  I am aware that an issue has arisen with the delivery of the scheme in West Cork and officials from my Department have been in contact with West Cork Development  Partnership on a number of occasions. I understand that the company have outlined the challenges presented by the large number of participants on the Scheme in West Cork and the extensive area covered by the trails there. It is clear that the company has a significant workload relative to other areas and this issue will form part of the consideration of the the implementation of the Review of the Walks Scheme. The final report was received by my Department in July and I expect to soon be in a position to publish the report and respond to the concerns raised. </p>  <p>  I am committed to working with all of the stakeholders, including West Cork Development Partnership, to ensure that the scheme can continue to function effectively.</p></reply>

My Department is currently engaging bilaterally with relevant Government Departments and Agencies to discuss the issues raised by island communities through the public consultation process and to assess how they might be addressed.
