The aim of this debate was to deepen awareness of how climate is relevant to the work of the Security Council, and to outline what actions the Security Council could take within its mandate to address climate-related security risks. </p>  <p>  As an elected member of the UN Security Council, Ireland is prioritising the issue of Climate and Security.  Ireland is co-chair of the Informal Expert Group on Climate and Security of Members of the Security Council along with Niger for this year. </p>  <p>At the debate, I stated Ireland&rsquo;s intention to convene a discussion on a thematic Resolution on the topic. </p>  <p>  Initial discussions on the Resolution have now been convened by Ireland and Niger, as co-chairs of the Informal Expert Group. We are aware that not all Council members are like-minded on this topic, but we are hopeful for constructive engagement over the coming period.</p></reply>

I also attended a number of events hosted by him during the summit.</p>  <p>  I spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Johnson on 20th July, in light of the cancellation of our meeting planned for the previous day, for COVID reasons. We discussed the Northern Ireland Protocol and I stressed the importance of utilising the EU-UK framework for issues related to the Protocol. We exchanged views on the Covid-19 situation, especially in regard to the Delta variant. I also raised legacy issues, including serious concerns at the British Government&rsquo;s proposals and the impact they would have on victims and families. </p>  <p>  Previously, I met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Chequers on Friday 14th May.</p>  <p>  On that occasion, our discussions focused on ways our two Governments can continue to work together to support all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and promote peace and prosperity on both a North/South and East/West basis. We also discussed implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol and legacy issues.</p></reply>

His openness to engage was a demonstration of the EU&rsquo;s wish to hear at first hand and to understand the concerns of the people on the ground.</p><p>Subsequently, on 13 October, the European Commission published a far-reaching package of proposals aimed at finding solutions to practical challenges that have arisen in implementing the Protocol. </p><p>The Commission has engaged deeply with the issues, with the people, and with businesses in Northern Ireland.  The Commission package reflects that engagement and is a serious and considered response to the challenges and concerns that have arisen. </p><p>This package is now the subject of ongoing engagement between the EU and UK.  </p><p>I hope the UK Government gives them the serious attention they deserve and engage positively and constructively with the European Commission.</p><p>A positive outcome to those ongoing engagements is in the interests of both the EU and the UK, but most especially of the people and businesses in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

There were no special or exceptional arrangements applying in this regard.</p>  <p>  While I have responsibility for answering questions on administrative matters connected with the Office of the Attorney General, I have no function in respect of the detail of the Attorney General&rsquo;s professional engagements outside of his role as Attorney General.</p>  <p>  Prior to his appointment, the Attorney General informed me and I informed the other leaders of the parties in Government that he had a small number of existing litigation commitments that he considered he had a professional obligation to discharge.  It was agreed that he would do so.</p>  <p>  The Attorney General&rsquo;s involvement in these matters dates back to 2011 in one case and 2017 in two others.  The first matter related to the State recapitalisation of Irish Permanent.  The Attorney General was involved in one hearing in that matter in November 2020 and his involvement ceased at that time.  The second matter related to a commercial dispute and the Attorney General's involvement ceased in February 2021.  The final matter related to the Inspectors investigation into certain matters relating to INM and involved a hearing on two Saturdays, 18 and 25 September 2021.  The Attorney General's involvement in that matter ceased on 25 September.  He has no continuing private professional obligations.  I would note also that the Attorney General is bound by a duty of confidentiality to his clients.</p></reply>

The lists are reviewed twice a year to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my Department and of the relevant policy Departments including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The reviews involve a public consultation with submissions invited from sectors.</p>  <p>  In the most recent review ten submissions were received from the Agri-Food sector referring to occupations in the horticulture, dairy, pig and poultry industries and meat processing.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the most recent review was announced on 28 October. A press release is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  As a result of the review and in light of the continued labour shortages in the Agriculture and Agri-Food Sector, I decided to extend previous quotas to release 1000 general employment permits for horticulture operatives, 500 for meat deboners, 1500 for meat processing operatives and 100 for Dairy Farm Assistants. The quota for Dairy Farm Assistants of 100 General Employment Permits is subject to the minimum annual remuneration threshold of &euro;30,000. This quota, as with all the agricultural quotas will be followed by a strategic review of labour attraction and retention. </p>  <p>  The Dairy Farm Assistant quota is expected to assist with the challenges of the sector in securing sufficient labour, particularly during the busy spring 2022 period when it is expected that family labour will become less available than in 2020 and 2021 as the economy reopens following the pandemic.</p></reply>

The WRC Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect was launched on 1st April 2021. I believe it is too early to review its application, though I am open to doing so at a later stage.</p>  <p>  Codes of Practice are written guidelines, agreed in a consultative process, setting out guidance and best practice for employers and employees with respect to compliance with employment legislation. Employers, employees, and their representative bodies find Codes of Practice particularly useful as reference points and they often serve as the basis for internal policies and procedures within firms and across sectors. </p>  <p>  While failure to follow a Code prepared under section 20(1)(a) of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 is not an offence in itself, section 20(9) provides that in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court or the WRC, a Code of Practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the Code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be considered in determining that question. </p>  <p>  The Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect is a best practice guide and template to remind employers of the statutory obligations around record keeping and ensuring compliance regarding maximum average weekly working hours permitted for employees and employees statutory rest period entitlements.  The Code is also aimed at ensuring employees are aware of their statutory entitlements and how to raise concerns in relation to non-compliance. </p>  <p>  Whilst the WRC does not have a role in monitoring implementation of any Code of Practice, ensuring employers compliance with their statutory obligations is part and parcel of every WRC Inspection undertaken.</p></reply>

After the pandemic, I believe people should have a choice to work from home or in the office, so long as the work gets done and business and service needs are met.</p>  <p>  The right to request remote work is part of the Government vision to make remote working a permanent feature of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce in a way that can benefit all &ndash; economically, socially and environmentally.  The commitment to introduce legislation to underpin employees' right to request remote work was made in the national Remote Work Strategy published last January. </p>  <p>  Currently, all employees can ask their employers for the right to work remotely, but there is no legal framework around which a request can be made and how it should be dealt with by the employer. This new law will set out a clear framework around which requesting, approving or refusing remote work can be based.</p>  <p>  I carried out a public consultation in April and there was significant engagement. Informed by the public consultation, which included submissions from both employer and trade union representative groups and also a review of international best practice, the drafting of the General Scheme of the Bill has commenced. I will be seeking Cabinet approval for the drafting of Heads of a Bill this quarter and the Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible thereafter. The intention is to introduce a mechanism for employees to request remote working that is fair but does not place an undue burden on employers. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, there is plenty of advice and information available. The Government launched the #MakingRemoteWork campaign in June this year. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the advice and information available from Government to help workers and employers facilitate more remote and blended working.</p>  <p>  This includes guidance for employers and workers and a Remote Working Checklist which are all available on the DETE website.</p></reply>

The Act also significantly strengthens the overarching climate governance framework and embeds a process of carbon budgeting, including sectoral emission ceilings. The plans and strategies established on a statutory footing under the Act will require that policies are put in place to ensure carbon budget ceilings are not breached. Putting these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action.</p>  <p>  I am currently finalising an ambitious set of climate actions, through a new Climate Action Plan, that will set indicative sectoral emission ranges for 2030. This will mean more renewable energy, decreased transport emissions, changes in how we heat our homes and how we grow our food and look after our land. The Climate Action Plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with specific owners, timelines and steps needed to achieve each action. Under the new legislation, my Department will update the Climate Action Plan every year so that our actions keep step with the trajectory required to achieve our targets. </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 27 October, almost 273,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 115,000 premises have build works currently underway. The first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan. Surveys are complete or underway in County Westmeath in Mullingar, Sonna, Stonehall, Taghmon, Jamestown, Hopestown and Athlone. Pre-build works have commenced in the areas around Athlone and main build works have commenced in the areas around Mullingar. I am advised by NBI that it expects the premises referred to in the Question to be passed and available for connection in H1, 2022. </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 27 October, 386 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCPs are connected at Ballycomoyle GAA Club, Milltown Emper Community Centre, Whitehall Community Centre, Streete Parish Park &amp;amp; Community Hall, Castledaly Community Centre and Clonkill Hurling Club (4km from the premises referred to).

I am advised by NBI that, as of 27 October, some 12,942 premises in County Donegal have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Donegal in the areas of Letterkenny, Creeslough, Tamney, Bunbeg, Arranmore, Rutland Island/Burtonport and Inisfree Island/Burtonport. Surveying is the first step towards delivering the new fibre network and informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network.  I am further advised that pre-build works are underway in Letterkenny.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Donegal through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. </p>  <p>  Given the nature of the build and ongoing work to address the impact of Covid-19 related delays, it is not possible to give specific details on a per townland and quarter year basis out to 2026. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 27 October, 386 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCPs are connected at Rathlin Knitwear, Dunree Military Museum, Ray Community Centre, Glenveagh National Park, Malin Head, Tory Co-Op, Leghowney Community Centre, Meenreagh Hostel, Sliabh Liag Ranger Station, The Gweedore Theatre and Cranford Coole Community Centre. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Urbalreagh National School, Scoil Naomh Cholmcille, Drumfad National School, Scoil Naoimh Colum and Doaghbeg National School have been installed by NBI for educational access.

The grant schemes are kept under continuous review to ensure that they are as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.</p>  <p>  To date in 2021, almost &euro;65m has been provided in grants to support the purchase of electric cars. By year end, this will represent almost a doubling of supports to EVs in 2020.</p>  <p>  As a result, the EV percentage of overall car registrations has increased significantly this year and represented over 15% to end Q3 2021. Government is on track as regards the number of vehicles which need to be sold in 2021 to reach its projected annual EV target as set out in the CAP 2019. As of 30 September, there were 45,423 EVs registered in the national fleet.</p>  <p>  In the past year, many new BEVs with ranges of over 400km on a single charge have been introduced to the Irish market. Range anxiety is no longer an issue for electric vehicle purchasers, and while PHEVs provided an interim option, but emit both CO2 and air pollution emissions, this interim option is no longer necessary. Government supports should be provided to full electric vehicles, which will be the most effective means of reaching our carbon reduction pathway.</p>  <p>  I announced after the budget that grant support for PHEVs will be removed from 1 January 2021. Any PHEV which registers for the grant in accordance with the scheme rules before this date will be approved and the commitment carried forward into Q1 2022. However, from 1 January 2022 the SEAI will no longer accept grant applications in respect of PHEVs. </p>  <p>  For the top 10 PHEVS sold in 2020, four are high cost vehicles for which a grant would not be applicable and two have a direct BEV equivalent, that would be more useful in terms of decarbonizing the car fleet. Of the four remaining, three are made by manufacturers that have an equivalent size BEV model and only one model has no BEV alternative in its range. </p>  <p>  Under the Terms and Conditions of the grant process, drawdowns normally need to be made by year end (31 Dec). However, due to the slowdown in global car manufacturing, I am extending this drawdown date to 31 March 2021, to allow time for customers to take final possession of the vehicle. </p>  <p>  A range of incentives are in place to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles including:</p>  <p>  - VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000 for BEVs;</p>  <p>  - A grant of up to &euro;600 towards the installation cost of a domestic charge point for new and second-hand BEVs or PHEVs; </p>  <p>  - A low rate of motor tax;</p>  <p>  - BEV and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles (greater off-peak rates also apply to the M50 toll);</p>  <p>  - BEVs qualify for a 0% Benefit-in-Kind rate up to &euro;50,000 without mileage conditions;</p>  <p>  - BEV/PHEVs and their associated recharging infrastructure qualify under the ACA scheme and;</p>  <p>  - A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi/hackney/limousine sector with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible. Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric with up to &euro;20K available for a new BEV, &euro;25K for a new wheelchair accessible BEV and &euro;15K for a new wheelchair accessible PHEV.</p></reply>

Critical frontline workers continue to be the priority for the driver testing service.</p><p>The service continues to operate under restrictions in the interest of making it a safe environment while there is an ongoing presence of Covid. Given the necessity for a tester to be in close proximity to a test candidate, and to get into vehicles brought by the candidates which are therefore not a controlled environment, this places obvious limits on the capacity of the test service. </p><p>When the service resumed in June 2020, testers were conducting five tests each per day. Since 27 September 2021, this has been increased to seven tests per tester per day.</p><p>In order to deal with the backlog, the RSA received sanction to hire 40 new temporary testers, in addition to 36 they were sanctioned to retain or rehire in 2020. These new testers have completed their training and are now conducting live tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40 testers. An extra 10 temporary test centres have been opened and a further 9 locations have been expanded within the existing premises, to accommodate more testers. </p><p>The volume of tests being offered weekly continues to grow and for the past 4 weeks the average increased to 4098 tests being offered per week.

It is aimed at improving air quality in urban areas, together with influencing the uptake of zero emission passenger cars by improving general perception and awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use. The Scheme is funded by the Department and administered by NTA acting as agents of the Department with delegated authority and as the licensing authority for SPSVs.</p>  <p>  &euro;15m was allocated to support taxis to switch to electric. Over &euro;8m has now been paid out to applicants under the scheme with the remaining funds committed in the form of provisional grant offers.</p>  <p>  Per the Terms and Conditions of the eSPSV Grant Scheme 2021 the scheme may close if funding has reached capacity. The funds have reached capacity for 2021 and therefore the scheme closed as of 30th September 2021.</p>  <p>  The Department has funded an eSPSV scheme in previous years and as part of the Budget 2022 it was announced that there will be a scheme available in 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, per the Terms and Conditions of the eSPSV Grant Scheme 2021 any Grant Offer Letter issued to an applicant is valid until the earliest of three calendar months from the date of the Grant Offer Letter, the Scheme End date or 31 December 2021. The three calendar month period has been selected to allow reasonable time for vehicle delivery and completion of the vehicle licensing process.  </p>  <p>  However, any eSPSV which has an existing grant offer and was due to be delivered in 2021 but has met unforeseen delays due to semi-conductor shortage, may avail of an extension to 31st March 2022. This applies to an eSPSV of any value. Grant applicants should contact the NTA to arrange for this extension in relation to vehicles purchased and due for delivery in 2021. </p>  <p>  The allocation of funding to be carried forward into the next year is a matter for the Minister for PER, and I am engaging with him on this matter.  </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable.</p>  <p>  I announced the 2021 Regional and Local Road (RLR) allocations in February this year and all grant funding available to my Department has now been allocated. The allocation made available to Cork County Council this year is  &euro;68.5 million. </p>  <p>  The Department appreciates that, within the overall parameters set for the regional and local road grant programmes, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this. It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas.</p>  <p>  There were major cutbacks in funding for the road network in general during the post 2008 recession. As a result there is a backlog of road repair works in all local authority jurisdictions across the country.  As funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate protection and renewal of regional and local roads, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the protection and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.</p>  <p>  Within the budget available to the Department, funding is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible to eligible local authorities. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority's area of responsibility with some account taken of traffic. </p>  <p>  The main regional and local road grant programmes are focussed on specific policy objectives i.e. surface sealing to protect the road surface from water damage, road strengthening based on pavement condition rating to lengthen the life of roads and a Discretionary Grant Scheme which allows for a specified range of activities including winter maintenance.  These 3 grant programmes account for most of the grant funding. Apart from a requirement that 15% of the road strengthening grant is spent on regional roads, the allocation of funding to different categories of road is  a matter for decision by each local authority. </p></reply>

It faces imminent and important milestones in the coming months and these milestones will determine its progress in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Firstly, there is Government&rsquo;s approval of the Preliminary Business Case and secondly there is the submission of a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  On that first milestone, my Department has received draft Preliminary Business Cases for MetroLink.  This represents Decision Gate 1 under the Public Spending Code and the Preliminary Business Case is currently under review.</p>  <p>  For major projects, like MetroLink, the Public Spending Code requires a Government decision and I expect to seek such a Government decision in the near future.  If approved by Government, that will allow MetroLink to move into the statutory planning system, subject to the completion of the necessary planning and environmental documentation. </p>  <p>  The second impending milestone is the submission of Railway Order applications for MetroLink. That application requires the finalisation of an extensive set of documentation, including environmental impact assessment reports, and that work is ongoing in relation to this project.  </p>  <p>  I understand that an extensive body of work remains in relation to finalising the preliminary design, completing the required environmental impact assessment reports and closing out property referencing issues.  This should be completed during Q1 next year and, subject to the Government decision mentioned above, the project will then be ready to seek planning permission.</p>  <p>  An actual construction start date will ultimately be determined by the planning process and Government approval to proceed to construction at that time.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the current position.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-03a.124.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021110300076#WRC03600"><p>At the outset it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover in such circumstances.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p><p>On a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  For example, in relation to motor insurance, factors may include those such as the age of the driver and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age and type of vehicle, how the vehicle is used, the claims record, the number of drivers, and the location of storage.  Insurers also price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and do not all use the same combination of rating factors, so as a result prices vary across the market.  </p><p>Notwithstanding this, the difficulties faced by returning emigrants in respect of motor insurance was recognised by the Cost of Insurance Working Group (which ran between 2016 and 2020) and was the subject of a particular recommendation.  In this regard, a protocol was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance in relation to returning emigrants, under which insurance companies committed to accepting the driving experience of such drivers gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  The details of it is available on Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s website and the websites of its member companies.</p><p>The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated differently to any other driver, subject to verification of their continued driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  Thus, a returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending that time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.  My Department continues to review the implementation of this recommendation through its regular engagement with Insurance Ireland.</p><p>In relation to insurance more generally, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening andwidening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government. It is my intention, along with Minister of State Fleming, to work to ensure that the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government are progressed in accordance with the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>. As the Deputy may be aware, the Cabinet Committee Insurance Reform Sub-Group in July published the first six-monthly Implementation Report of the Action Plan. This shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now completed. The Sub-Group&rsquo;s focus now is on implementing the outstanding actions on time.</p><p>I would also like to note that, according to Central Statistics Office (CSO) data for September 2021, motor insurance prices are continuing to decline. Motor insurance prices in June were 36.6% lower than their peak in July 2016; and 8.4% lower than when the Government&rsquo;s Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform was established in September 2020. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this positive downward trend continues as the reform agenda progresses, including for returning emigrants.</p><p>In addition, it may interest anyone affected by this issue to know that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover. This can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu. In addition, Brokers Ireland can be contacted at insurancequeries@brokersireland.ie. </p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the <i>Action Plan</i>, including measures to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care in order to strengthen waivers and notices. It is my hope that the implementation of these key actions in particular should further help to improve the affordability and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and voluntary groups &ndash; including motorists in particular.</p></reply>

Over time, however, the relief had moved away from its original policy focus, and was being used regularly for the purpose of gifts. </p>  <p>  Consequently, changes were agreed in Finance Act 2016 so that the dwelling house exemption is only available for inheritances, and not gifts. The exception to this is where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative. For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. </p>  <p>  The intention in allowing such gifts under the dwelling house exemption is to facilitate independent living for infirm and elderly people. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to remove the condition that, in the context of gifts qualifying for the dwelling house exemption, a person must be a dependent relative of the person making a gift of a house to another person.</p></reply>

From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  However, in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold.</p>  <p>  The BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. The new BIK regime will commence on 1/1/2023 and from that date EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. ICE vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.</p></reply>

These services, which include an online communication channel through the <i>MyEnquiries</i>system, are available 24/7, are easy to use, are fully secure and, in most cases, remove the need to make telephone contact.

This was done through a pilot initiative called the National Taking in Charge Initiative (NTICI). </p>  <p>  Following the NTICI process my Department published the National Taking in Charge Initiative Report, in 2018. The report sets outs details of the bids arrangements and funding made to local authorities under the pilot initiative. The report included findings and recommendations which led to the introduction of the multi-annual funding programme, now in place, for the progressive resolution of housing estates with developer provided water services infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The report is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p>  <p>www.housing.old.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/national_taking_in_charge_initiative_report_dec2018.pdf  </p>  <p>  Under the NTICI process Tipperary County Council were recouped &euro;278,616 for the resolution of three estates with developer provided water services infrastructure (see Table 2 of NTICI report).</p>  <p>  On 21 September 2020, I announced allocations under the new multi-annual capital investment programme - the Multi-annual Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure Resolution Programme 2019-2021 - for the progressive resolution of housing estates with developer provided water services infrastructure, to enable the taking in charge of these estates. </p>  <p>  The focus of the first multi-annual programme is on estates in towns and villages where the resolution is to connect their water services to the public networks. The programme will also support a number of pilot projects where connection is not feasible in the immediate future. These pilot projects, together with a major study currently being undertaken by Irish Water, will inform future policy considerations on resolving sub-standard developer provided infrastructure with sustainable solutions.</p>  <p>  All local authorities that submitted bids were informed about the outcome of their bids in a circular which included a copy of an independent Expert Panel report on the bids process. The report provides the commentary of the Panel on their evaluation in the case of unsuccessful bids and guidance for the local authority in making future bids in upcoming programmes.</p>  <p>  The circular is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p>  <p>www.housing.gov.ie/water/water-services/circular-ldpi01-2020-approval-projects-residential-estates-under-developer  </p>  <p>  None of the eleven bids from Tipperary County Council examined under the first announcement were successful (see table at Appendix C of the report) for funding for resolution of their developer provided infrastructure. However, under the approvals circular, local authorities were asked to examine further estates that required funding for resolution. Arising from this process, valid bids for four estates were received from Tipperary County Council. </p>  <p>  I am awaiting a report from the Expert Panel following an evaluation of these further estates and the pilot projects.</p></reply>

The solicitor certifying the title must be a practising solicitor, that is, s/he must hold a practising certificate from the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  In addition, the solicitor certifying the title must be the purchaser&rsquo;s solicitor, that is, the solicitor who acted for the purchaser in the relevant conveyance or assignment. </p>  <p>  Section 32(1) of the Registration of Title Act 1964, as substituted by Section 55 of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, provides for the rectification of errors originating in the Land Registry and not cases such as those outlined by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In cases where incorrect information is provided in a Form 3 for which registration has been completed, the PRA has no legal basis to withdraw the folio from the Register.  Rectification of the National Land Register for such cases rests with the solicitor and/or the applicant, and an appropriate application or a Court Order must be lodged in the PRA to ensure the title is accurately reflected in the Register and the Land Registry Map. The correct application will depend on the particular circumstances of the case, and the solicitor for the owner, rather than the PRA, is the appropriate person to advise on this. The PRA may, however, be able to assist a solicitor in avoiding queries, if they engage prior to lodgement. </p>  <p>  Section 31(1) of the Registration of Title Act 1964 gives further power to the courts to make orders in a case of actual fraud or mistake.</p>  <p>  In cases where incorrect information is contained in a Form 3 for which registration is still pending, the lodging solicitor should withdraw the dealing.</p></reply>

Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.</p><p>- The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), is Ireland&rsquo;s official standards body and is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. NSAI has produced additional guidance to some harmonised standards, under the CPR, in the form of Standard Recommendations (SRs) which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain construction products in Ireland.</p><p>The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the CPR and in particular for the Declaration of Performance/CE marking of the construction product he or she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the NSAI.  </p><p>In relation to the specification of concrete blocks, the relevant suite of harmonised standards facilitating specification of masonry units is the EN 771 (series).  NSAI has published additional guidance in the form of &lsquo;<i>S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018/AC:2019 Recommendations for the design of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6&rsquo; </i>which  <i></i></p><p><i>- </i>provides guidance on the choice of masonry units and mortar classes most appropriate for particular situations as regards durability for finished work in Ireland, and</p><p>- recommends the use of Category 1 aggregate concrete blocks, which require independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks). </p><p>Aggregate is a key constituent of concrete blocks. Category 1 aggregate concrete blocks, should meet the prescribed density, compressive strength and be made with dense aggregate conforming to &lsquo;I.S. EN 12620+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo; and &lsquo;S.R. 16:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo;. Importantly, <i>&lsquo;S.R. 16:2016&rsquo;</i>outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production. This includes the requirement for a geological and petrographic assessment of the raw material (i.e. the quarry deposit) and of the finished aggregate product for use in concrete and concrete products to be carried out at regular intervals. The key objective of the geological and petrological examination is to determine if aggregates for the manufacture of concrete are fit for purpose and if deleterious materials are present in such form or quantity that may affect end use and performance.</p><p>Whilst the CPR focuses on the conditions which apply when placing a product on the market, clients, specifiers, designers and builders etc., should:</p><p>- when drawing up specifications, refer to the harmonised technical specifications and  specifically to the requirements of individual characteristics when necessary,</p><p>-<font color="#001A26">when choosing the products most suitable for their intended use in construction works, review the manufacturer&rsquo;s Declaration of Performance,</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- check the Standard Recommendations published by NSAI, which give guidance on appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of the product in Ireland, and</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- ensure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021, in this regard all works should be carried out in a workmanlike manner, using proper materials which are fit for he use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</font></p><p>Each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of the Market Surveillance Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/1020). This Regulation establishes an EU wide framework for market surveillance, and came into full effect in July 2021. This strengthens the existing provisions in the CPR (and other Union harmonisation legislation), relating to the compliance of products, the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on products entering the EU market.</p><p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas.</p><p>In addition, Dublin City Council has been appointed as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021 is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.Geological Survey Ireland are providing technical assistance and expertise to this campaign.  </p><p>In addition, I have asked the NBCO, in collaboration with GSI to conduct a focussed campaign in Co Donegal in relation to concrete blocks to ensure compliance with standards. </p></reply>

There are currently 67,000 first time applications on hand with the Passport Service. Almost half of online first time applications require the applicant or their guardian to submit the documents necessary to complete the passport application. These cannot be processed by the Passport Service until all relevant documents have been submitted and the application is fully complete. The Passport Service engages with all applicants who have not submitted the required documentation to ensure that their application is completed correctly and can proceed through the processing system. Unfortunately, 5,000 (7%) of first time applications are past the estimated issue date advised on our website. The Passport Service prioritises these applications and is working very hard to eliminate this problem. </p>  <p>  Over half a million passports and cards have been issued to date in 2021. Almost 45% of passports for simple online adult renewals issue within one business day. There are currently 135,000 passport applications on hand at the Passport Service. Of these, over 50,000 online applications are pending submission by the applicant of a range of outstanding documentation. </p>  <p>  To protect the integrity of the Irish Passport, first time applications require careful processing in order to validate the identity of the applicant and their entitlement to Irish citizenship for the first time. Additionally, in the case of children, consent of guardians must be validated. Accordingly, the current processing time for first-time online applications is longer than for that of a passport renewal application. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times, including examining the processes around the verification and processing of the supporting documentation for first time applicants. The Passport Service is also working closely with the Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Division and with the Public Appointments Service on an ongoing basis to recruit additional staff to meet the current and forecasted demand for passports, including first time applications.</p>  <p>  The Passport Online service is the most efficient channel for passport applications and is available to first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. I urge citizens and parents applying for first time passports for themselves or their minor children to ensure that they apply in plenty of time in order to have their passport in hand well in advance of their travel date.</p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m for the Passport Service in response to the increasing demand for passports at home and abroad.</p></reply>

Once a person is entered onto the Foreign Births Register, they are an Irish citizen and are entitled to apply for an Irish passport. </p>  <p>  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the processing time for Foreign Birth Registration applications stood at 18 months due to an unprecedented surge in applications as a result of Brexit, and the necessary rigorous processing that applies to citizenship applications. </p>  <p>  Due to pandemic-related restrictions, the current pause in Foreign Birth Registration processing began in late December 2020. Since their return to the workplace, Foreign Birth Registration staff have been reassigned to assist in the delivery of essential services. There are approximately 31,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on-hand. Foreign Birth Registration staff have continued to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Over 5,000 emergency Foreign Birth Registration applications have been processed so far in 2021. In cases of exceptional urgency, Foreign Birth Registration applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the Department will operate a transparent general policy of processing Foreign Birth Registration applications in order of receipt.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is actively planning to resume processing Foreign Birth Registration applications as soon as possible and I will arrange to have the Deputy informed once a date for the resumption of processing these applications has been finalised. My Department is committed to allocating further resources to assist with the high volume of applications, with a focus on reducing turnaround times.

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p><font color="#001A26">- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will  be processed in order of date received.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on th</font>e NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools  </p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Where a school is dissatisfied with how their exceptional review has been processed or is dissatisfied with the outcome of their exceptional review they can appeal. Applications for Appeal may be submitted through the NCSE Schools Portal: ncse.ie/school-support. Guidelines for the appeal are published here: ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website. www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

The Scheme, which was developed in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, provides for ex gratia payments to be made to those who qualify to apply for the Scheme and who satisfy the criteria as set out in the Terms of Scheme.</p><p>The ex gratia scheme was originally established in 2015 and was put in place to provide those, who had instituted legal proceedings against the State in respect of day school sexual abuse and subsequently discontinued those proceedings following rulings in the domestic courts, with an opportunity to apply for an ex gratia payment.  The Scheme was paused in 2019 following a report from retired High Court Judge Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill who, as Independent Assessor, reviewed a number of unsuccessful applications to the Scheme and was of the view that the criteria to qualify for a payment were too restrictive for this group of applicants.  The revised scheme opened for applications on July 21st 2021. 33 payments have issued so far. </p><p>Full details of the terms of the Scheme are available on www.gov.ie/en/service/90a42-revised-ex-gratia-scheme/.  Contact details for my Department for those wishing to apply to the scheme who require any clarification or information are provided.</p><p>Ireland is committed to fulfilling its obligations in implementing the ECtHR ruling.  This means that the revised scheme is designed first and foremost to provide a remedy to those who had issued and discontinued their proceedings against the State prior to the ECtHR ruling in <i>O'Keeffe v Ireland</i>and who did not receive a payment under the 2015 Scheme.  However, the revised scheme goes beyond that group in that all others who issued legal proceedings against the State at a later date and up to 1 July 2021, whether they are still in being, were discontinued at any point, or who had settled with the State, may also apply for an award.  </p><p>As well as broadening the scope of the Scheme, the type and nature of evidence that will be considered by the State Claims Agency in respect of individual applications (and as set out in the Terms of Scheme) broadens the means through which an applicant can demonstrate that they fall within the terms of the ECtHR judgment. </p><p>Overall, &euro;31m has been allocated for the scheme.  </p></reply>

It remains a key objective of the plan for living with COVID-19 that our children and school staff can attend school safely.  Further school closures are not envisaged during this phase of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated schools closures have had adverse consequences for many children and their families. The impact on children with special educational needs has been greatest. </p>  <p>  For this reason, my Department has prioritised support for this vulnerable group through the provision of additional supports, additional guidance for schools and new and enhanced education programmes.</p>  <p>  Pupils with special educational needs were prioritised for an early return to in-school teaching and learning earlier this year.</p>  <p>  While school buildings were closed, these students had access to a Supplementary Programme which provided additional one-to-one tuition or care support in their homes up until the end of April.</p>  <p>  A significantly expanded Summer Programme was offered during the summer vacation period.  This programme put an emphasis on supporting children with special educational needs to re-engage with education, rebuild their confidence and increase motivation, promote their wellbeing and inclusion and to help ensure that they could transition to their planned educational placements in September 2021.  A home-based strand was also available to pupils with complex needs where their school was not in a position to run a programme. </p>  <p>  Ensuring that schools can operate safely has been a key priority for Government. The Department of Education has an ongoing close working relationship with the Department of Health and the HSE throughout the period of the pandemic in the context of implementing important infection prevention control measures in schools to ensure that they can operate safely. Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with public health advice. The infection prevention and control measures in place in schools have worked very effectively to prevent and control Covid-19 in schools and remain in place for this school year. </p>  <p>  Public health has reviewed the measures put in place to ensure safe operation of schools and is satisfied that these infection prevention and control measures, when implemented correctly and adhered to, will continue to keep the school community safe. The Department will continue to work closely with public health officials and the education stakeholders in respect of the safe operation of schools during Covid-19.</p></reply>

There are currently just over 1,500 people in receipt of diet supplement at a cost of almost &euro;0.9m in 2020.</p>  <p>  A review of the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute was commissioned by my department during 2013.  The research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme could be met from within one-third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate, which was then paid at &euro;186 per week (and is currently paid at &euro;201 per week).  I am advised that the diet supplement scheme was discontinued for new applicants from 1 February 2014 on the basis of this evidence. </p>  <p>  Recipients continue to receive the diet supplement at their existing rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change.  This measure ensured that nobody was immediately worse off by the closure of the scheme. </p>  <p>  In cases of particular hardship, officials continue to have the legislative power to award a Supplementary Welfare Allowance payment in cases of exceptional need. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A new Wellbeing Unit was established to provide advice and supports for staff in the areas of overall health including work-life balance.</p>  <p>  The Code on the Right to Disconnect  (April, 2021) complements existing legislation which support employers&rsquo; and employees&rsquo; rights and obligations under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 and the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 &ndash; 2014.  These rights and obligations are managed and implemented by the Department's Human Resources and Facilities Management support areas.</p>  <p>  The Department is collaborating with the Department of Public Expenditure and Expenditure to design and develop a Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service to support individual government departments in their introduction of long term blended working arrangements.  The Right to Disconnect will be reflected in the Department's policy which will be published in early 2022 and will ensure the aims of the Code are reflected including to support 'both employers and employees to maximise the benefit from this changed working environment'.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Code, the blended policy will also provide for employee and employer obligations that work is carried out safely, ensure that employees&rsquo; rights are preserved and that employers and employees adhere to a balanced working environment.</p></reply>

The section goes on to specify that such regulations may make provision requiring the board to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child to be given into the custody of his parent.  </p><p>Under this section, regulations are in place governing foster care, placement of children with relatives, and residential care.  These regulations place obligations on Tusla in relation to putting in place and reviewing a care plan for the child, and also require that in reviewing the plan, Tusla must consider whether the circumstances of the parents of the child have changed, and whether it would be in the best interest of the child to be given into the custody of his or her parents. </p><p>Tusla inform me that data on reunification reports is not available or gathered by them. However, as outlined above, the consideration of reunification is a requirement in all cases and is required to be evidenced before the courts when care orders are applied for. Reunification is also an aim under the national model of practice in Tusla and is considered in every case.

I have therefore referred the matter to Tusla, and asked that a direct response be provided to the Deputy. I would like to mention however, that officials from my Department and Tusla have regular engagements regarding the service performance and activity data that is regularly published by Tusla and, when required, there are processes in place for the Department to request new performance indicators.</p>  <p>  Under Section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991 Tusla has a statutory function to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. This applies to all children, regardless of their age.  </p>  <p>  When a referral about a child welfare or protection concern is made,  Tusla social workers must assess the circumstances of the child or children involved.  Appropriate action to ensure the safety and protection of that child or children must be taken. These actions can include applying to the District Court for an order under Section 13, 17 or 18 of the Child Care Act if the child or children are considered to be at immediate and serious risk.</p>  <p>  Section 17 Orders are Interim Care Orders, and it is possible that an application for such an order would be made in the case of a newborn especially if a pre-birth case conference has taken place and the court judged that the child will be at serious risk if they do not come into care.  Breastfeeding is very important for babies, however the risks to the child must be weighed against mitigating factors and a decision made in the best interests of the child.</p></reply>

It will ensure that Irish speakers can interact with the Government and access public services through a high standard of Irish. Further information on this bill can be found in the following link www.gov.ie/en/press-release/a8eef-official-languages-bill-amendment-2019-before-the-dail/.</p>  <p>  There is already a broad range of courses available in Irish in higher education institutions that will meet future demand. </p>  <p>  The objective of the Advanced Irish Language Skills Initiative, funded by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, is to ensure the availability of qualified persons with Irish language skills to meet recruitment needs in Ireland and the EU. Under this scheme the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht provides funding for a range of specialised third level Irish language courses in areas such as translation, interpretation and law. Further information on this Initiative can be found in the following link www.gov.ie/en/publication/7c05c-third-level-education/.</p>  <p>  Under the Advanced Irish Language Strategic Initiative there are 8 courses available in 5 different institutions. There were 73 students enrolled in these courses in 2019/2020 and 84 students enrolled in 2020/2021.</p>  <p>  As of 2020/21, there were 67 courses in Higher Education delivering Irish language tuition or delivered through the medium of Irish, a total of 1,674 students (6,283 since 2016/17). This includes courses in Teacher Training colleges, but excludes courses in Irish Studies, Irish history, folklore, music/dance and the likes. A further 1,021 students are recorded as taking Irish language as a subject as part of a further 37 courses (5,618 students since 2016/17).</p>  <p>   The Department distributes recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for disbursement directly to the HEA's designated higher education institutions. The HEA distributes this funding as a block grant to the institutions. As autonomous bodies, payment of this funding, including any expenditure on Irish-language education initiatives, falls to the individual institution.</p>  <p>  In addition, specific support is provided for the development of Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge in NUIG. The Department has agreed to provide an allocation of &euro;900,000 for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 academic years.</p>  <p>   The Acadamh is a research and educational institution which is intended to promote and develop Irish-medium education. It is headquartered in NUIG&rsquo;s main Galway City campus, but also has campuses in the Ceathr&uacute; Rua  and Carna in Connemara, and in the Doir&iacute; Beaga in Gaoth Dobhair, Donegal.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, Higher Education Institutions (HEI) are autonomous, and determine themselves which Irish-language courses will be offered. While my Department will continue to be committed to the implementation of the Official Languages Act, it is not within my remit to direct a HEI as to the courses they offer. </p></reply>

Private housing lease agreements will not be accepted.</p>  <p>- A letter on headed paper from a Rental Agency confirming their tenancy;</p>  <p>- A utility bill or statement of top-ups for pay as you go utility meters in their own name, for example; landline telephone, fixed broadband, gas, electricity, cable/satellite television, home heating, waste, mortgage statements or property tax letters. SUSI does not accept mobile telephone bills. If the utility bills in the household are in the applicant&rsquo;s spouse's name, they are required to provide their marriage certificate with the utility bill. If they are co-habiting, SUSI will accept utility bills in their partner's name covering the relevant period along with correspondence issued to the applicant, at the same address and covering the relevant period e.g. bank statement or Statement of Liability/P21 or equivalent if sourced from outside the State; and/or</p>  <p>- Official documentation posted to the applicant at their address and relating to their residence there. For example, a letter from a Department of Social Protection confirming Rent Allowance at this address or a letter from any Government department confirming they are living independently from their parents. Please note, SUSI does not accept bank statements alone for this purpose.</p>  <p>  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p></reply>

This includes the number of members assigned to armed units. As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has pointed out, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a largely unarmed police service with a proud tradition of being a community police service by fostering close links with the communities it serves.  I know that the Garda Commissioner is fully committed to this principle and echoes the statement of the first Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Michael Staines, who stated, &ldquo;The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will succeed not by force of arms or numbers, but on their moral authority as servants of the people.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  I can also assure the Deputy that the Government and I, as Minister, remain fully committed to continuing the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a community based and largely unarmed police service. </p>  <p>  Armed Support Units (ASU) were established on a regional basis in order to provide an armed response capacity and capability to support and supplement, where necessary, front line unarmed uniformed Garda colleagues. Members of the ASU are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols in a uniform that deliberately distinguishes them from their unarmed uniformed colleagues. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering on the report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI), which puts community policing at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's work.  In this regard, as the Deputy will be aware, earlier this year my Department published the General Scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. This Bill will improve the performance and accountability of our policing and security services, and support the human rights of all people throughout Ireland, including the right to be and feel safe in their communities. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy, that section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2020, as amended by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, provides for the Policing Authority, with the approval of the Minister for Justice, to determine or revise the priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in performing its functions relating to policing services. The most recent policing priorities for 2021 reflect the work of the Policing Authority as well as the outcomes of the Authority's public consultation and consultation with Joint Policing Committees. The Policing Priorities for 2021 may be viewed on the website of the Policing Authority www.policingauthority.ie.</p></reply>

While the Bill will address these issues for EU transfers, it does not, as it stands, alter the position for other Convention states. Critically, after Brexit, UK transfers do not fall under the Framework Decision and will continue to take place under the Convention and existing 1995 Act. </p>  <p>  Work is continuing on amendments to the Convention regime, and it is the intention to seek Government approval to progress these necessary changes via amendments to the current Bill.</p>  <p>  The issues involved are particularly complex given the wide range of possible sentencing structures that may be involved, and the amended regime must be suitable to deal not only with transfers from the UK, but also from other Convention states. </p>  <p>  The outline of the proposed amendments has been drafted and legal advice is currently pending to ensure that they are robust. </p>  <p>  On receipt of this advice I hope to be in a position to quickly seek Government approval to introduce them.</p></reply>

It is important to ensure that the costs, benefits, and unintended consequences of any policy changes are fully understood and resolved before they are put in place. There is no existing exemption of rental or similar income from assessment within the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and due care needs to be taken to ensure that any future changes are appropriate; to protect and meet the needs of residents while also making provision for those in need of housing.</p><p>The Department of Health and other government departments continue to collaborate on this policy, including the identification of the number of houses that may be brought into use and the costs associated with the policy options available to address this action, with a view to introducing legislation as soon as possible once this analysis and policy development is complete.</p></reply>

The new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs.   </p>  <p>  In parallel with this, the Department has committed to establishing a Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group. The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and examine the evidence regarding the skills and labour market shortage, in home support and nursing homes. Potential areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, skills development, and sustainable employment of home carers into the future. </p>  <p>  The National Skills Bulletin 2021 produced by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS on behalf of the National Skills Council (NSC) presents an overview of the Irish labour market at occupational level.  In relation to Care Workers and Home Carers it reports that employment numbers fell for this occupation over the five-year period, with the decline relating primarily to the previous year, most likely due to COVID-19. Despite this, there was a high number of recent job hires in 2020, indicating that job churn is a factor for this occupation. There is also a high share (24%) of those working in this occupation aged 55 years and older which may affect replacement demand. Despite these issues, there was a high volume of vacancies advertised for care workers and demand for care workers is likely to be sustained given Ireland's ageing demographic profile.</p>  <p>  On 27th October 2021 Minister English announced changes to the employment permits system on foot of the most recent review of the occupations lists. It was not considered appropriate to make any changes to the eligibility for employment permits for Home Carers on this occasion as there was insufficient evidence that the issue is not one of terms and conditions.</p>  <p>  A large proportion of the staff who work in the homecare industry are employed by companies operating in the private sector and as such do not fall under the remit of the Department of Health or its agencies. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the terms and conditions, or the contracts of employment being offered in the private sector.  </p>  <p>  However, the continuing reopening of the economy and the labour market over the next few months should help to ease the labour shortages in the home care sector. </p></reply>

The safety of fishing vessels and safety certification, including matters relating to stability, is the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has no function in relation to the safety certification of fishing vessels or matters arising in relation to their stability. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Programme is the principal source of development funding for our seafood sector.  The Programme is implemented under the provisions of the EMFF Regulation (508/2014) which specifies to what purposes funds can be granted.  There is no particular provision of the EMFF Regulation that would facilitate an ex-gratia payment to assist in the case raised by the Deputy.  Furthermore, it is not possible to provide a grant for the decommissioning of the vessel concerned, as under the terms of the EMFF Regulation, decommissioning is not permitted after 31 December 2018.  </p><p>A new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) Regulation (2021/1139) for the 2021- 27 period was enacted in July 2021 and my Department is preparing a new corresponding Seafood Development Programme, which should be in operation next year.  However, similar to the EMFF Regulation, the new EMFAF only permits decommissioning of fishing vessels for very specific purposes concerned with addressing an identified imbalance in a particular fleet segment and only allows decommissioning of active fishing vessels and so is unlikely to be relevant to the case identified by the Deputy.<i></i></p></reply>

This has driven a sharp focus on the need for solutions and actions to address these pressing challenges. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has signalled his intention to publish the climate action plan 2021 soon. My Department is participating in several working groups contributing to the drafting of the plan. Climate action is actively being embedded across policies, programmes and work streams within my Department and the agencies under my remit, creating opportunities for innovation and to harness the collective input of policymakers, scientists, technical experts and industry representatives to generate meaningful climate action.  As a cross-cutting, wide ranging policy, this Plan will be considered in full by Government.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, progress continues to be made on implementation of the existing actions in the Interim Climate Actions 2021 published earlier this year.  These include work on a baseline study of ocean environmental variables from current programmes; the development of a natural capital accounting system for the seafood sector and resource efficiency tools for seafood processors.  Progress reports are regularly published online at: gov.ie - Climate Action: Important Publications (www.gov.ie)</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s goals for sustainable fisheries are supported through the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  The CFP provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in the waters around Ireland and throughout EU waters.  The CFP specifically provides that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long-term and are managed in a way that is consistent with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of contributing to the availability of food supplies.</p>  <p>   Technical measures are used to support sustainable fishing.  Technical measures are rules on how, where and when fishers may fish and also include requirements regarding fishing gear, catch composition and ways to deal with accidental catches.  A revised and updated EU Regulation on conservation though technical measures was adopted by Council and Parliament on 20 June 2019 (EU Regulation 2019/1241).  This Regulation sets the baseline standards for each sea basin.</p>  <p>  EU Member States with a fisheries interest in a given sea basin may agree on regional technical measures, adapted to the specific regional circumstances. Such measures can then be adopted as EU secondary legislation, if confirmed by scientists to be consistent with the objectives of the common fisheries policy.  Ireland works with Member States in the North West Waters region and are advised by  stakeholders through the North West Waters Advisory Council and Pelagic Advisory Council to agree appropriate technical measures for the fisheries in which we participate.    </p>  <p>  Under the CFP, EU fishing fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds subject to allocated fish quotas and compliance with the rules of the CFP, including those regarding fishing gear. </p>  <p>  Fishery management measures for offshore Special Areas of Conservation off Ireland&rsquo;s west coast &ndash; the Belgica Mound Province, Hovland Mound Province, North-west Porcupine Bank and South-west Porcupine Bank &ndash; are set out in the Technical Measures Regulation (EU Regulation 2019/1241).  These sites are Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service under the Habitats Directive for the protection of reefs.  In order to protect these habitats, the use of bottom contacting gear in these areas is prohibited under the Technical Measures Regulation.  This prohibition applies to all vessels, both Irish and non-Irish, operating in these areas.  </p></reply>

No. 8 of 2012, Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Registration of Horse Premises) Order 2012, and the requirement to have a valid passport for each donkey with the animal registered in the applicant's name. Full details are available in the terms and conditions booklet for the scheme, which is available on the Department's website. </p>  <p>  In particular, donkeys can only account for 50% of the stocking density requirement for a participant.  Participants are required to use other eligible livestock to fulfil the other 50% requirement.</p>  <p>  This change was introduced following the consultation process carried out as part of the review of the designated areas ahead of the launch of the 2019 ANC scheme. It was supported by the relevant farming bodies and approved by the EU Commission when Ireland's Rural Development Programme was amended.</p>  <p>  There is no proposal to amend the existing eligibility rules for the remainder of the current ANC scheme. The process of drawing up the successor scheme to the ANC under the new CAP is currently underway and details of the eligibility requirements for that scheme will be published once they are available.</p></reply>

Our beef and sheep farmers are the bedrock of our sector.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I announced that more than &euro;100 million will be provided in 2022 in targeted supports for the beef and sheep sectors including BDGP, BEEP-S, Sheep Welfare Scheme and Dairy Calf Programme.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently announced the details of the new &euro;9.8 billion CAP 2023 &ndash; 2027 budget and have given indicative allocations for each intervention in Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan.  </p>  <p>  The proposed list of interventions has been developed following an extensive period of consultations conducted by he Department over the past two years including engagement with the national CAP Stakeholder Consultative Committee and, most recently, a detailed public consultation that attracted over 1,000 submissions, and an ongoing series of in person, mart meetings over the past few weeks.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that funding over the seven-year period 2021-2027 is increased by almost 30%, or &euro;1.2 billion, compared to the 2014-2020 period.  In relation to the suckler scheme an allocation of &euro;260 million has been provided for the suckler carbon efficiency programme. For sheep farmers, an allocation of &euro;100 million was made for a sheep improvement scheme.  </p>  <p>  Details of these schemes will be announced in due course.  In addition to these specific measures, suckler and sheep farmers can avail of a range of other CAP measures including ANC, AECM and the Organic Farming Scheme.</p>  <p>  I regret entirely the notion that farmers are being sold out in the recent CAP proposals.  In fact, the proposals for Pillar II of the CAP Strategic Plan provide record funding for farmers, and much of this funding  will be made available to suckler and sheep farmers.</p>  <p>  Farmers can be assured that they will receive continued support in the ongoing economic and environmentally sustainable development of the sectors. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 supports Ireland&rsquo;s transition to Net Zero and achieve a climate neutral economy no later than 2050.</p>  <p>  There are also strong synergies between effective climate action and the market dynamics for beef and sheep meat.  Any failure to address climate and environmental issues will ultimately militate against the best interests of the agriculture sector.</p>  <p>  AgClimatise, the National Climate and Air Roadmap for the Agriculture Sector published by my Department last December, is a living document which sets out 29 actions designed to achieve a climate neutral agriculture sector.  In addition, I am confident that the strategic framework set out in the recently published Food Vision 2030 strategy, sets out an effective pathway to deal with these challenges, while establishing Ireland as a world leader in sustainable food systems.</p>  <p>  The Department and I continue to prioritise supporting sustainable development including through targeted supports aimed at supporting primary producers to increase the environmental and economic efficiency of their operations.</p></reply>

It makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland.  Cork County Council has secured over &euro;6 million in funding since the Scheme was re-established in 2017. </p>  <p>  The allocation of funding under the Local Improvement Scheme in recent years has been based on the physical area of each county, with maximum and minimum amounts applied for any individual county. Cork receives the highest allocation of any county based on this methodology. For example, the 2021 Scheme was launched in May with funding of &euro;10.5 million and Cork was allocated &euro;920,000. This represented the maximum level of funding available to any individual county. </p>  <p>  I should also clarify that this year I was able to allocate an additional &euro;10.5m under the Scheme after the initial allocation was announced. This funding was provided on the understanding  that it would be fully utilised by each Local Authority before the end of this year. As a result, it would not have been appropriate to allocate this additional funding without ascertaining what level of works could be delivered in each county before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  My officials engaged directly with each local authority, including Cork County Council, to establish the number of road projects they could complete by year-end and the associated level of funding required to deliver these before the end of the year. Each Local Authority received 70% of what they indicated they had the capacity to deliver before the end of the year.  On this basis, Cork County Council secured some &euro;493,000 under this second tranche, bringing their total funding in 2021 to over &euro;1.4 million.  </p></reply>
