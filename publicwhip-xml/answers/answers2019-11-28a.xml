Without high speed broadband it will be much more difficult to sustain existing jobs or create new ones. It will make it possible for rural Ireland to take advantage of the opportunities created by the digital economy, from health care to farming from education to agricultural development to tourism</p>  <p>  Officials working in the NBP Division of my Department, supported by a team of external expert advisers, have been working on this initiative since 2013. The total amount spent to date on the National Broadband Plan is &euro;28.833 million. This amount is largely comprised of the cost of these external advisers, as well as other costs associated with the procurement process. These external advisers have provided advice across many areas of expertise including, technical advice, financial and procurement advice, legal advice, economic and strategic advice, environmental advice and insurance and tax advice. The cost of external advisers to date is &euro;28.16 million. </p>  <p>  My Department's NBP team has also been supported by other officers across the Department. While the Department does not operate on a basis of allocating costs for each staff member across its range of functions, salary and other administration related costs for the Department are published in the annual Estimates and in the Appropriation Account.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-28a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800033#WRA01000"><p>Transitioning away from fossil fuels to more renewable, sustainable energy sources is at the heart of the Climate Action Plan.</p><p>Currently 40% of our homes use coal and peat for heating, many in combination with other fossil fuel heating systems. By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps. Currently over 99% of our vehicle fleet is powered by fossil fuels. By 2030, nearly a million electric vehicles will be on our roads. These measures will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions of harmful pollutants.</p><p>Extending the ban on the use of smoky coal would also have a positive impact on air quality, particularly in built up areas. </p><p>The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to 26 major urban areas. </p><p>My two predecessors proposed national extension of the smoky coal ban, but a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to extend the smoky coal ban. </p><p>This is very disappointing.</p><p>The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without a nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because these products produce similar levels of pollution. The legal threat is not only to take down any new nationwide ban, but to remove the existing ban which is currently in place in cities and many towns around the country. </p><p>In that context, it is particularly important to ensure that the measures put forward are not vulnerable to legal challenge, and I am continuing to work to finalise a legally robust way forward which will improve air quality by reducing air pollution, without jeopardising the existing ban. </p><p>I also intend to publish a Clean Air Strategy, which will set out a number of policies to improve air quality nationwide, in the coming months. </p><p>My Department is also funding the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s roll-out of the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), which will greatly improve the data available on air pollution in Ireland, facilitating the design and targeting of appropriate policy measures to tackle it.</p></reply>

The Committee also highlighted the importance of exploring opportunities to green existing jobs, and create new jobs in areas such as energy retrofitting for buildings, sustainable forestry and peatland restoration. </p><p>The Government has responded to this challenge in its Climate Action Plan, and subsequently with funding allocated through Budget 2020 and the appointment of Just Transition Commissioner for the Midlands.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan identifies the need to plan appropriately to ensure that those most affected by our transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient society are supported and equipped to contribute to this transition.</p><p>The Plan sets out a number of actions to support this objective, including: </p><p>- a programme of analysis to assess the economic and employment implications of the transition to a low-carbon economy </p><p>- the establishment of a Just Transition Review Group under NESC working group structures to advise the Climate Action Delivery Board </p><p>- supporting the work of the Midlands Regional Transition Team, the Midlands Regional Enterprise Strategy and the Midlands Regional Skills Forum </p><p>- identifying sources of funding that could be used to support the transition to a low-carbon economy and society, including inclusion of peat in the EU Coal Platform on transition. </p><p>Building on the actions in the Climate Action Plan, Budget 2020 allocated funding to support a Just Transition in the Midlands region, comprising:</p><p>- &euro;20 million for a new energy efficiency retrofitting scheme with the social housing stock in the region at its core, but enabling private homeowners to opt-in </p><p>- &euro;5 million for peatland rehabilitation </p><p>- &euro;6 million for a dedicated new Just Transition Fund, with ESB agreeing to contribute an additional &euro;5 million to this fund bringing its total value to &euro;11m.</p><p>My Department is in discussions with the European Commission with a view to making a state aid application for PSO support for an enhanced peat land restoration and rehabilitation scheme in the midlands. This is currently being processed through the State Aid pre-notification procedure.</p><p>The Government has appointed Mr Kieran Mulvey as the Just Transition Commissioner to facilitate discussions and work with stakeholders to develop, mobilise, and deliver opportunities for the Midlands. The Commissioner will collaborate with, and build on the work undertaken by, the existing local taskforces to ensure that locally generated ideas and projects are brought forward for consideration for funding from the Just Transition Fund. I published the terms of reference for the work of the Just Transition Commissioner on 19 November 2019. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-28a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800033#WRA01800"><p>The managed transition out of peat envisaged by Bord na M&oacute;na has been significantly impacted by the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision to refuse planning permission for ESB's West Offaly Power station beyond the end of 2020 and the subsequent ESB decision to withdraw a planning permission application for the Lough Ree Power station.</p>  <p>  Government has already taken significant steps to ensure that a just transition for the Midlands is adequately supported. This includes:</p>  <p>  - &euro;6 million for a Just Transition Fund, targeted at the Midlands, to support the retraining and reskilling of workers and to assist local communities and businesses in the Region to adjust to the low carbon transition. </p>  <p>  - Following the announcement that ESB intends to cease operations at the two plants at the end of 2020, ESB has committed to contributing an additional &euro;5 million to the just transition fund, bring the fund to &euro;11m. </p>  <p>  - &euro;5 million for a National Parks and Wildlife Service bog restoration and rehabilitation programme to restore 1,800 hectares of bog to their natural habitat, ensuring the return of these bogs to carbons sinks once again and creating 70 to 100 jobs; and </p>  <p>  - &euro;20 million targeted at the Midlands, to deliver a new model to group housing upgrades, as set out in the Climate Action Plan, which will support an estimated 400 direct and indirect jobs, as well as significantly upgrading the social housing stock in the region. </p>  <p>  Mr Kieran Mulvey has been appointed as the Just Transition Commissioner to co-ordinate Government&rsquo;s response to an accelerated exit from peat for electricity generation. </p>  <p>  Following proactive engagement by my Department and Bord na M&oacute;na, including a request from myself to Commissioner Ca&ntilde;ete earlier this year, the Midlands Region was accepted into the Coal Regions in Transition Platform in July. Membership enables the Midlands Region to avail of the support of a dedicated Country Team to assist with the development of strategies and projects for the region, focusing in particular on the employment challenges faced by workers. </p>  <p>  My Department is also in discussions with the European Commission with regards to the use of a Public Service Obligation to fund an extensive bog rehabilitation programme. This would provide Bord na M&oacute;na with the funds necessary to rehabilitate their industrial bogs above and beyond the legal requirements under their EPA licences. </p>  <p>  An interdepartmental group led by Department of An Taoiseach has been established to develop a just transition plan for the Midlands. Clearly this work cuts across a number of Government Departments, including my own Department, Public Expenditure and Reform, Business, Employment and Innovation, Rural and Community Development, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p></reply>

Learning from experience both in Ireland as well as other jurisdictions, it will:</p><p>- Group homes in the same area together to drive down cost; </p><p>- Start with social homes owned by the local authorities, but will include privately owned homes in the wider community; </p><p>- Introduce easy pay back models; and </p><p>- Develop smart finance. </p><p>The cost of bringing a home to a B2 or cost optimal standard is determined by a number of factors including the size and type of home as well as the starting condition of the home. A cost-optimal analysis commissioned by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government estimated the cost to achieve a B2 rating from a starting point of a D or E rating to be in the range of &euro;21,000-&euro;39,000. 90% of our dwellings are estimated to have Building Energy Ratings below a B2. Through the development of a new retrofitting model, we want to bring this cost down. </p><p>There are approximately 1.7 million occupied houses and apartments in the country. &euro;50 billion is based on a high level estimate of the cost of bringing those premises up to a B2 standard. A key task of the recently established Retrofit Taskforce will be to develop the new model and determine the overall cost associated with the retrofit programme to 203 and the most cost effective ways of achieving the level of retrofit upgrades required.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.</p>  <p>  The 2019 budget allocation for the Warmer Homes Scheme is &euro;39.8 million. The budget for 2020 will be &euro;52.8 million - a record level of funding for the scheme. &euro;13 million of this funding will come from the increase in the carbon price.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the measures available under the scheme were expanded. Previously, those homes which were not suitable for cavity wall insulation could not get their walls insulated under the scheme. Since the expansion of measures, the scheme can now, in certain circumstances, provide internal or external wall insulation. This is permitting the upgrade of a wider range of property types, such as homes with solid walls, and also increases the energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme can achieve. In addition, it will enable future fuel switching.</p>  <p>  Demand for the scheme is extremely high, reflecting the shift to deeper measures, and is impacted by longer delivery times associated with these types of works and the available budget. </p>  <p>  Action 173 of the Climate Action Plan commits to reviewing ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need. This review is underway and is scheduled for completion by the end of the year. </p></reply>

High speed broadband will allow citizens and businesses in rural communities to enjoy broadband speeds comparable to and in many cases better than speeds available to those living in towns and cities. This will enable rural communities to avail of the opportunities presented by the digital economy including healthcare, education, farming, rural development and tourism.</p>  <p>  High speed broadband services will allow farmers and farming communities to avail of new and emerging technologies that rely on a fast and reliable broadband service. Farmers can benefit through smart farming which allows increased production quality, remote monitoring of livestock, lower operational costs, reduced impact on the environment, better security technology and easier interaction with State bodies online.</p>  <p>  The benefits of high speed broadband to people&rsquo;s healthcare include enabling remote monitoring of older and vulnerable people in their homes, improving home-based care as an alternative to hospitalisation and the increased use of video medical appointments.</p>  <p>  In addition, the provision of high speed broadband in rural Ireland is of critical importance in areas such as flexible and remote working. Remote or home-working is becoming an increasingly prevalent employment model, including amongst overseas firms that continue to invest in Ireland. This area of the economy is projected to double over the next 5 years. It will also afford national and international employers better access to a wider catchment of skilled workers, even where offices and businesses are located within more rural areas.</p>  <p>  An initial enabler to rural communities will be the early roll out of community based Broadband Connection Points. It is expected that 298 Broadband Connection Points will be established and providing a high speed broadband service by the end of 2020.</p></reply>

This has impacted on the capacity of all broadcasters, including RTE, to produce high quality Irish content and to commission such content from independent producers.</p>  <p>  In July 2019, the Government accepted the recommendations of the Working Group on the Future Funding of Public Service Broadcasting that TV Licence Collection should be put out to public tender for a five year period to reduce the evasion rate. This process will be initiated as soon as the enabling legislation, the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill, which passed Second Stage in October 2019, has been enacted. At the end of the contract period, the licence fee will be replaced by a device independent broadcasting charge to take account of changes in how Irish people consume content. These reforms will generate additional funding for public service broadcasting. </p>  <p>  In addition to the reform of the public funding model, and in line with the commitment in my Department's Statement of Strategy, there will also be a review of two provisions of the Broadcasting Act, 2009. </p>  <p>  First, there will be a review of the proportion of TV licence funding allocated to the Sound and Vision Scheme under the Broadcasting Fund with a view to assessing whether it should be increased. At present, the Broadcasting Fund amounts to 7% of net TV licence receipts, currently &euro;14.5 million. This scheme, which is administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, supports the production of high quality TV and radio programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience and is accessible by independent producers and commercial broadcasters. </p>  <p>  There will also be a review of the minimum amount of funding that RTE is obliged to make available under Section 116 of the Act, for external commissioning of radio and television programming. Notwithstanding its financial difficulties, RTE continues to meet the statutory minimum amount of such funding which in 2018 amounted to &euro;39.7m. The review will examine if this statutory minimum level can be further increased which would provide an important additional stimulus for the independent sector.</p></reply>

High speed connectivity has multiple potential positive impacts on the lives and livelihoods of citizens throughout the country. The National Broadband Plan will ensure that those benefits can be enjoyed by the 1.1 million people living and working in the Intervention Area, in nearly 540,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms and 695 schools where commercial operators will not commit to deliver this service.</p>  <p>  It will encourage and facilitate new models of service in Health, Education and in Enterprise and help communities to benefit from new economic activities. More people will be able to work remotely, receive services in their own homes, and have access to technologies that will make for smarter living, learning, farming and business.</p>  <p>  The Government decision to appoint NBI as preferred bidder in May of this year was informed by detailed analysis of alternative options to deliver the NBP. That analysis, which was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in May, considered additional short term and longer term options, for example, the establishment of a State Agency for broadband delivery, designation of a new mandate to an existing State body such as the ESB, or the use of 4G and 5G technologies.</p>  <p>  The analysis shows that all of the alternative options identified would take longer to reach 100% of the Intervention Area premises compared to the current plan, may be more costly, in most cases would require a consultation on a new strategy as well as a new procurement process and State Aid application, and may not provide the level of future proofing required under the Commission&rsquo;s strategy, &ldquo;Connectivity for a European Gigabit Society&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The deployment of the network will quickly bring tangible benefits to those living in rural areas. Next year communities will be able to avail of high speed broadband services at approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points in rural locations around the country.</p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 115,000 premises by the end of 2021, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p>  <p>  No matter where a person lives in Ireland, the National Broadband Plan will ensure equality of opportunity to fully participate in the digital society.</p></reply>

By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps. Currently over 99% of our vehicle fleet is powered by fossil fuels. By 2030, nearly a million electric vehicles (35%-40%) will be on our roads. These measures will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions of harmful pollutants. </p>  <p>  Extending the ban on the use of smoky coal would also have a positive impact on air quality, particularly in built up areas. </p>  <p>  The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to our major cities. </p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in the air and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. </p>  <p>  Regarding the proposed national extension of the smoky coal ban, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban. </p>  <p>  This is particularly disappointing, given the impact poor air quality can have on human health and the environment and the emphasis the Government is putting on transitioning to a low carbon society. </p>  <p>  The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without a nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because these products produce similar levels of pollution. The legal threat is not only to take down any new nationwide ban, but to remove the existing ban which is currently in place in cities and many towns around the country. </p>  <p>  In that context, it is particularly important to ensure that the measures put forward are not vulnerable to legal challenge, and I am continuing to work to finalise a legally robust way forward which will improve air quality by reducing air pollution, without jeopardising the existing ban. </p>  <p>  I also intend to publish a Clean Air Strategy, which will set out a number of policies to improve air quality nationwide in the coming months. </p>  <p>  My Department is also funding the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s roll-out of the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), which will greatly improve the data available on air pollution in Ireland, facilitating the design and targeting of appropriate policy measures to tackle it.</p></reply>

PCIs are cross border energy projects deemed by the European Commission to be of the highest priority within the EU. The fourth PCI list was published in October 2019 pending ratification in early 2020.</p>  <p>  The North South Interconnector is critical to improving the efficient operation of the Single Electricity Market and increasing security of electricity supply across the island of Ireland. A resilient and well connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic wellbeing and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p>  <p>  In December 2016, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the project in Ireland, while in January 2018 full planning permission was granted for the section of the line that lies in Northern Ireland. Both of the planning decisions have been subject to legal proceedings in each jurisdiction. In Ireland, a Supreme Court appeal of the planning permission was dismissed on 19 February 2019. </p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland, on 8 February 2019, the Department for Infrastructure asked the High Court to quash the planning permission given so the planning application can be re-determined under new legislation introduced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in November 2018. On 24 July, SONI/EirGrid submitted an addendum to the Environmental Statement to the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland. That Department subsequently carried out a consultation process in Northern Ireland to provide members of the public with the opportunity to review and comment on the addendum and is now reviewing the submissions received. The Department for Infrastructure will determine in the coming months as to whether there is a need to re-open the public inquiry or if a final planning decision can be taken by the Permanent Secretary under the NI Planning and Functions Exercise Act.</p>  <p>  In June 2019, ESB Networks awarded a framework contract for the design, test and supply of steelwork in relation to the project. I am advised that the detailed design is currently in progress. However under the framework there will be no supply of materials until the planning process in Northern Ireland is complete. The earliest possible date for construction to commence is 2020.</p></reply>

It is heartening to see the active engagement and mobilisation to the climate crisis which is, without doubt, the defining challenge of our generation. I thank the members of the Youth Assembly for their recommendations for action to stop climate breakdown which I am currently considering.</p>  <p>  In relation to the recommendation to implement a tiered tax system on large companies, 104 installations are currently included the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in Ireland. The EU ETS is a cornerstone of the European Union's policy to combat climate change and its key tool for reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively. It is the biggest international system for trading greenhouse gas emission allowances and covers more than 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 31 countries, as well as airlines. In addition, to the 104 stationary installations, 13 aircraft operators are also included under the scheme in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government supports a strong EU ETS that promotes investment in decarbonisation in the power generation and industrial sectors in support of EU and Member States&rsquo; long-term decarbonisation objectives. Reforms to the ETS were introduced in 2018 in order to achieve a 43% reduction in ETS emissions by 2030 relative to 2005 levels. These reforms, including changes to the market stability reserve to address the prevailing surplus of allowances within the ETS, and improvements in the resilience of the ETS to major price shocks by provisions for periodic adjustments to the supply of allowances to be auctioned, are beginning to take effect. The reforms are already having an impact on the price of ETS allowances, with market prices currently in the region of &euro;25 per tonne, up from just under &euro;8 per tonne in January 2018.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the strengthened EU ETS regime at EU level, the Climate Action Plan sets out a number of supplementary measures to reduce emissions from the sectors covered by the EU ETS in Ireland, including:</p>  <p>  - delivering an early and complete phase-out of coal and peat fired electricity generation;</p>  <p>  - increasing electricity generated from renewable source to 70%;</p>  <p>  - working with the enterprise sector to support delivery of identified potential for cost-effective mitigation over the next decade.</p></reply>

In this context, the Government has committed to delivering a whole-of-Government approach to addressing this challenge, and to working with local stakeholders to ensure that people impacted can be best be supported.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 prioritised a number of just transition initiatives including:</p>  <p>  - &euro;6m Just Transition Fund targeted at the Midlands, to support the retraining and reskilling of workers and to assist local communities and businesses in the Region to adjust to the low carbon transition. In recognition of their longstanding relationship with communities in the Midlands, the ESB has agreed to contribute an additional &euro;5 million to this fund bringing its total value to &euro;11m. While details around the allocation of this fund are still being finalised, it is expected that it will support retraining and reskilling workers and assist local communities and businesses in the Midlands to adjust to the low carbon transition. There will be further consultation with the structures in place in the Midlands, including the Midlands Transition Team, on the application of the funding. In addition, I have invited the Just Transition Commissioner, Mr Keiran Mulvey, to make recommendations to me on the operation of the Just Transition Fund </p>  <p>  - &euro;5m for bog restoration and rehabilitation which will restore bogs to their natural habitat and become sinks that absorb carbon. This programme will support the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) to restore 1,800 hectares of bog in 7 counties, resulting in 28m tonnes of carbon stored over the next 5 years. It will create 70 jobs in year one, rising to 100 as the programme develops.</p>  <p>  - &euro;20m to deliver new model, to group housing upgrades together, as set out in the Climate Action Plan. Targeted at the Midlands, this will support an estimated 400 jobs directly and indirectly, as well as significantly upgrading the social housing stock in the region during 2020. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, Budget 2020 included specific provisions for protecting the most vulnerable:</p>  <p>  - A total of &euro;52.8 million is being made available to retrofit the homes of people living in, or at risk of, energy poverty through the Warmer Homes Scheme. This represents the biggest ever allocation for the Warmer Homes Scheme &ndash; more than double the initial allocation for 2019. &euro;13 million of this funding is ring-fenced revenue arising from the increase in the Carbon Tax. </p>  <p>  - The changes to the Fuel Allowance Scheme led by the Department of Social Protection, will increase the income of households who get the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week which means an annual increase of &euro;56. </p></reply>

Since 2000, over 400,000 homeowners have received direct support under these schemes. </p>  <p>  Social housing upgrades are primarily a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. A budget of &euro;25 million has been allocated to that Department for the social housing energy efficiency retrofit programme in both 2019 and 2020. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has also provided an additional &euro;20 million from revenues arising from the increase in the carbon tax for the retrofitting of social housing in the Midlands. This scheme will operate in a different way to the traditional local authority retrofit scheme by focusing on upgrading much larger batches of homes in distinct, compact geographical areas and providing the opportunity for private homeowners to retrofit their homes. This will determine the savings that can be achieved through a larger scale and more structured approach to the renovation of our housing stock. It will also provide an economic stimulus for the region. The specific design of the project will be driven by the Retrofit Taskforce which is chaired by my Department. </p>  <p>  Although Local Authorities have in recent years received some limited funding through the Better Energy Communities and Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Schemes, the SEAI does not have a ring-fenced allocation for local authority homes. Since 2016, the total expenditure on the Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Scheme is &euro;26.3 million and the SEAI estimate approximately 15% of this amount has been spent on local authority homes. It is not intended to have an SEAI ring-fenced allocation for local authorities in 2020.</p></reply>

I intend to bring the draft heads to Government by end-2019.</p>  <p>  While it would be impossible to protect people from every danger online, this Bill will ensure, for the first time, that robust regulation is in place and end the era of self-regulation by online platforms.</p></reply>

Ireland has abundant, diverse and indigenous renewable energy, which will be critical to decarbonising our energy system and enhancing our security of supply.</p>  <p>  The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) under development is critical to delivering on the ambitious target of 70% of electricity demand by 2030. To achieve 70% renewable electricity will require the grid to be able to recieve almost 100% electricity from renewables when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining. The 70% is an average figure, reflecting that there will be times when wind and solar final are not available. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is being designed to achieve its targets within a competitive framework which will put downward pressure on the costs to end consumers. The RESS auctions will ultimately determine the precise mix and cost of renewable projects and technology diversity, including onshore and offshore wind, solar, hydro and ocean technologies, will occur naturally as the scheme matures. </p>  <p>  Private sector funding through corporate contracting will also be essential for meeting higher levels of ambition to increase renewable energy supply. The Climate Action Plan commits to a 15% target for the renewable industry to develop projects through subsidy free corporate power purchase agreements by 2030.</p>  <p>  Long term decarbonisation of the electricity sector will require significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s potential in offshore renewables including harnessing the potential to export power generated offshore to other EU Member States. Further reinforcement of the grid (including greater interconnection to allow electricity to flow between Ireland and other countries), and putting systems in place to manage intermittent sources of power through developing a range of storage technologies will be essential. </p>  <p>  While significant investment will be required to meet long term targets in decarbonisation of electricity, rapidly falling costs of renewable energy technologies will help reduce the costs to energy consumers. The Department will ensure that the costs of electricity from renewable energy sources will be kept under review and that RESS auctions will be informed by up-to-date Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) analysis.</p></reply>

The Plan has been informed by the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and the All Party Committee on Climate Action. The Plan sets out over 180 actions, together with over 600 sub-actions, and embraces every relevant sector: electricity, enterprise, housing, heating, transport, agriculture, waste and the public sector.</p><p>The plan has a strong focus on implementation, with clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery.

The mapping exercise has been supported by a number of public consultations which have elicited significant response from industry and the public. </p>  <p>  The NBP contract, which was signed on 19 November, provides that the future proofed high speed broadband network to be deployed by National Broadband Ireland will also pass and connect new premises built in the intervention area over the next 25 years. The network will keep pace with developments outside the intervention area and minimum services offered will be reviewed every three to five years to ensure the network is keeping pace with demand. </p>  <p>  The tender submitted by National Broadband Ireland committed to a network that will initially provide services of 150Mbps to the majority of homes and up to 1Gbps to heavy data users and Small and Medium size Enterprises. Services on the network will be upgraded for consumers to 300Mbps by year 6 and 500Mbps by year 10 while businesses and heavy users will also get an upgrade to 2Gbps by year 11 and incrementally beyond that.</p></reply>

These targets cover emissions from sectors such as transport, agriculture, buildings and waste. The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published earlier this year by the EPA, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could remain between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020. </p>  <p>  The ESD allows Member States to meet their targets by means of unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets. </p>  <p>  The latest projections indicate that Ireland will cumulatively exceed its obligations by 14.8Mt over the 2013-2020 period. Ireland has, over the period since 2007, already acquired 5.3 million allowances that will be required for compliance. However, Ireland will need to purchase additional allowances to meet projected shortfalls in 2019 and 2020. My Department currently estimates the cost of this requirement to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required. Provision will be made in my Department's Vote for this purpose. </p>  <p>  This cost estimate is in addition to the costs already incurred from previous purchases and agreements entered into by the State, amounting to some &euro;121m in total since 2007, a proportion of which was used to meet Ireland's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol in the period 2008-2012.</p></reply>

However, there are complex issues at play in this area, which are understandable given the sensitive nature of the medical data in question.</p>  <p>  Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging was not introduced. ​A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017 to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Members of the Permanent Defence Force also cannot become members of a trade union. </p>  <p>  To compensate for these limitations there are a range of statutory redress mechanisms available to serving members, including  redress of wrongs, a Defence Forces Ombudsman and a Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p>  <p>   In 2017, the European Committee of Social Rights, in a non-binding ruling, upheld the prohibition of the right of military personnel to strike but did conclude that Ireland was in violation of Article 5 of the European Social Charter on the grounds of the prohibition against military representative associations from joining national employees organisations and in respect of Article 6.2 of the Charter regarding the right to bargain collectively.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the basis for the complaint pre-dates a number of significant Government initiatives. In relation to collective bargaining, the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations were afforded equal standing to other public sector trade unions and representative associations during the negotiations which led to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  </p>  <p>  The findings of the European Committee of Social Rights were considered as part of an independent review of the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force, which was completed last year. </p>  <p>  One of the recommendations from that review was that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with ICTU to explore the practicalities of a PDF representative association forming association/affiliation with ICTU, while giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service.</p>  <p>  Association with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective. I asked my officials to examine this matter further and, in this regard, Defence management (civil and military) have engaged in discussions with ICTU. Defence management have met with the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to discuss this matter. I have also discussed the matter of ICTU affiliation/association with both RACO and PDFORRA. </p>  <p>  I am aware of PDFORRAs longstanding ambition to affiliate with ICTU. I am also aware that RACO, the representative body for Commissioned Officers, have a conflicting position on this matter. The implications of possible association or affiliation are being carefully considered.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, the Government established the Public Service Pay Commission to provide objective advice to Government in relation to Public Service Pay Policy. Following the publication of the Public Service Pay Commission report in May 2017, the Government initiated negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, which culminated in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020. This Agreement was accepted by the PDF representative associations, that is RACO and PDFORRA and their members are receiving the benefits. </p>  <p>  Following the first report of the Pay Commission and in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government tasked the Commission with prioritising a comprehensive examination of recruitment and retention difficulties in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The report of the independent Public Service Pay Commission was published and accepted by Government in July this year. The Report contains a broad range of recommendations aimed at improving recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force.  In accepting the report of the Public Service Pay Commission, the Government also approved a plan Strengthening Our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase 1 to implement the recommendations in the report. The plan provides for a number of specific projects which are being progressed by civil and military personnel. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have received the benefits of collective agreements in the past and it is intended that future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will continue to be dealt with within this process.

The Bahraini authorties were contacted with a view to securing Ministerial meetings at which the Minister of State could discuss Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relationship with Bahrain, including our concerns about human rights. However, in the event, it was not possible on this occasion to secure such meetings as the relevant Ministers were out of the country. </p>  <p>  While consideration was given to postponing the visit it was decided to go ahead with the trade mission, given that a substantive programme was in place.

I raised the human rights situation with the Bahraini Foreign Minister in New York in September 2019 and officials from my Department met earlier this month with a delegation from Bahrain on human rights.

We, along with our EU partners, take these reports very seriously and have raised our concerns at official and political level with our Chinese counterparts on a consistent basis. </p>  <p>  Most recently, Ireland was one of 23 States to sign up to a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee on 29 October 2019. This statement called for the Chinese Government to urgently implement eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, including by refraining from the arbitrary detention of Uighurs and members of other Muslim communities.</p>  <p>  Ireland was also one of 22 States to sign up to a Joint Letter at the Human Rights Council in Geneva in July this year. This letter expressed concerns about credible reports of arbitrary detention in large-scale places of detention, as well as widespread surveillance and restrictions, particularly targeting Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. It called on China to uphold its national laws and international obligations and to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  At EU level, this issue was raised at both the EU-China Summit and EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in April this year. During the dialogue the EU noted that while actions to counter terrorism are essential, these actions must respect the principle of proportionality, fundamental freedoms, and international laws. The EU has also raised this issue at multilateral level, calling on China to allow meaningful, unrestricted, and unsupervised access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our EU partners, will continue to raise our concerns during contacts with Chinese authorities at both official and political level.</p></reply>

We are committed to promoting freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities. This commitment to promoting freedom of religion or belief is reaffirmed in the Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World.</p>  <p>  Within the EU, Ireland works with partners to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities. The EU's policy in this area is led by the Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief, which were adopted during our Presidency in 2013. The EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019 also includes an express reference to the promotion of freedom of religion or belief, and we will continue to work to ensure that these issues are addressed within the framework of the EU&rsquo;s external human rights policy.</p>  <p>The EU consistently raises concerns about violations of freedom of religion or belief in the course of political dialogues with partner countries, including human rights dialogues and consultations. The EU continues to be a strong advocate for Freedom of Religion or Belief in UN Multilateral fora, including at the Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly as well as in other international organisations including the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe. Most recently, the EU successfully tabled resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at the 40th session of the Human Rights Council in March 2019 and the 74th session of the UN General Assembly Third Committee in November 2019. Ireland co-sponsored both initiatives. </p>  <p>   In May 2016, the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker created the function of the Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief outside the EU, and appointed J&aacute;n Figel to the role. The Special Envoy has completed 16 official country visits since October 2016, during which he has met with government officials, civil society and human rights defenders. </p>  <p>   Finally the EU is providing financial support of over &euro;5m in the period 2018-2022 to three interfaith projects in the Middle East and Africa which aim to enhance cultural pluralism and intercultural understanding related to religion or belief. It has also increased its support to civil society projects on freedom of religion or belief under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights up to &euro;5.18m.</p></reply>

They are, though, keenly aware of the issues and concerns of those that may be affected by the outcome of the review. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the fact that we are coming closer to the date on which any changes on foot of the review are due to be implemented, I have, as I committed previously to do, written to Revenue seeking a factual update on the review. Once this process of engagement with Revenue has been completed, I will be in a position to comment further on the matter, and conscious of the timeline involved, I anticipate that I will be able to do so very shortly.</p></reply>

These distortions, which have very little impact on the underlying domestic economy, include the following:</p><p>- Investment in aircraft by the aircraft leasing sector for international leasing activities.</p><p>- The relocation of intellectual property-related assets or patents to Ireland. </p><p>The year-on-year declines in 2017 and 2018 are mainly a result of annual declines in the on-shoring in intellectual property assets by the multinational sector in those years, with investment by the aircraft leasing sector also a factor in 2017. However, when we look beyond these distortions it is clear that the underlying investment patterns in the economy in those years were positive.</p><p>Indeed, it should be noted that an alternative investment series - 'modified investment' - which is also published by the CSO and which removes the aircraft leasing and intellectual property related distortions from the GFCF figures, recorded positive growth rates in both 2017 and 2018.</p></reply>

The NIE contains the most recent series for gross domestic product (GDP) and related economic statistics for Ireland. The year-on-year percentage growth rates for GDP in constant (i.e. inflation adjusted) and current prices are presented in the table.  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2008 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>GDP (constant prices) </td>       <td>-4.5 </td>       <td>8.1 </td>       <td>8.2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>GDP (current prices) </td>       <td>-4.8 </td>       <td>9.4 </td>       <td>9.1 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The contraction in GDP in 2008 represents the onset of both the domestic and global recession. In particular, the negative growth in GDP is attributed to the negative growth in gross fixed capital formation (i.e. investment) and exports along with moderating private consumer spending in 2008 relative to 2007. </p><p>More recently, GDP has become increasingly distorted by the globalised activities of a small number of large multinational firms which have limited impact on actual activity in the Irish economy.</p><p>The GDP numbers in 2017 and 2018 are affected by these activities which include:</p><p>- Activity in the aircraft leasing sector which involves substantial investment in portfolios of aircraft for international leasing and which generate substantial fee income (i.e. services exports) without significant employment effects.</p><p>- The relocation of intellectual property (IP) related assets or patents to Ireland. </p><p>- The effect of 'contract manufacturing' whereby multinationals located in Ireland contract a party located abroad to produce and supply goods on their behalf to another party. Throughout this process the Irish firm retains economic ownership of the goods, such that sales of these products are recorded as exports in Ireland's national accounts.</p><p>While the high GDP growth rates recorded in 2017 and 2018 are impacted by a relatively small number of very large multinational firms who engage in these activities, the GDP figures are compiled in accordance with best international practice and statistical standards.  However, as Ireland is a small, open and highly globalised economy, the relevance of GDP as a metric by which underlying economic trends and changes in living standards can be assessed is considerably less than elsewhere.</p><p>To address this, the CSO publishes additional series, including modified gross national income (GNI*) and modified domestic demand, which are more closely related to the domestic economy. In particular, modified domestic demand - that is domestic demand excluding investment in foreign owned IP and leased aircraft - increased by 2.8 and 4.8 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively, pointing to robust growth in the domestic economy.</p></reply>

In total 176  tax expenditure measures are identified, in respect of which the total revenue forgone is estimated to be &euro;5.3 billion, are classified under the following nine broad headings Capital taxes (CAT/CGT); Pensions; Stamp Duty/DIRT; Local Property Tax ; Benefits-in-Kind; Corporation Tax; Excise Duty; VAT and Personal Tax Credits. It should however be noted that data for over 40% of the tax expenditures listed is not available, so the total revenue foregone of &euro;5.3 billion listed in the Report does not reflect the full amount of such expenditure.</p><p>The absence of revenue foregone data on a given tax expenditure can be due to any one or more of a number of reasons, including:</p><p>- It not being collected (normally where such collection/costing is not required in law);</p><p>- Revenue, due to taxpayer confidentiality considerations, being unable to provide the data  necessary to cost a particular tax expenditure as doing so might allow the use of the expenditure concerned to be linked to a particular taxpayer or small number of taxpayers; or</p><p>- the revenue foregone figure is below &euro;50,000.</p><p>As the report is prepared on the basis of the latest available date on revenue forgone in respect of each measure, it is not possible to accurately forecast the projected size of tax expenditures at the end of 2020. </p><p>It should be noted that Revenue provides an extensive suite of costings across nearly all tax heads, most of which are published in their Ready Reckoner: . In recent years, Revenue have greatly expanded both the range of the costings and statistics published, as well as making this information available in more open and accessible formats as part of commitment to support the Government&rsquo;s Open Data initiative. </p><p>Furthermore, my Department periodically reviews its approach to tax forecasting. The last such report was published in 2008. At present, the Department is currently assessing its tax forecasting methodology with various institutions (domestic and international) represented. The analysis will focus on the composition of the Irish tax take and the accuracy of the Department&rsquo;s tax forecasts, with a plan to report before end-2019.</p><p>There is continued monitoring of tax expenditures by my Department. Over the course of each year, a number of reviews of tax expenditures and other tax related matters are carried out by, or on behalf of, the Department of Finance. These are intended to ensure that the tax expenditures and taxes they relate to remain fit-for-purpose, to ascertain whether existing tax expenditures and taxes should be amended, continued, extended or ended, or to otherwise review certain taxes (existing and proposed) or groups of taxes.  These reviews are normally published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  </p><p>In relation to further new tax expenditures in 2020, a range of options for possible new tax measures are examined as part of the Tax Strategy Group process each year. In addition to consideration of measures under individual tax heads, broader papers on the area of Tax Expenditures were prepared for the TSG in July this year, and previously in 2017.  These papers are published, and are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

A key recommendation arising from the CIWG&rsquo;s reports was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and the publication of its two reports.  The PIC conducted a benchmarking of award levels exercise between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time and this has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced. This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland are 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales. The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.  </p>  <p>  The relevant legislation to establish the Judicial Council was a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, and as the Deputy will be aware, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the Judicial Council Act 2019.  This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum. It is important to note that the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations.</p>  <p>  A key step to moving this matter forward is for the Chief Justice to make the necessary appointments to the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  I therefore welcome the recent announcement by Chief Justice Clarke that he has designated the seven judges that will sit on the Committee. I understand that the designate committee will commence its activities on an informal basis shortly.  This is an important development as it demonstrates that the Judiciary are giving this matter the priority I believe it deserves.  While I appreciate that the development of a new set of personal injury award guidelines is the prerogative of the Judiciary, I believe that much work has already been done, in particular the PIC benchmarking exercise, which should assist the Judiciary in completing this work as soon as possible.  The Government is willing to provide the Judiciary with any background assistance, such as input from the Cost of Insurance Working Group, should they think that necessary.  In that context, I am happy for my Department to play its role.  I also understand that PIAB has written to the Judiciary to offer its expertise and assistance for the purpose of this recalibration exercise.</p>  <p>  I might also add that in addition to the work of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, the Law Reform Commission (LRC) is carrying out a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries.  This is another important recommendation of the CIWG, which I believe should not be overlooked.  I believe that if there was a significant move in this area, it could also have an impact on insurance pricing and could also help attract new entrants into the insurance market.</p>  <p>  Finally, as I have stated before, I believe that if the issue of the level of awards in this country is addressed, that the problems facing particular businesses and community groups as a result of particular insurers either withdrawing from the market or increasing the price of insurance should recede.</p></reply>

The Ireland for Finance strategy is supported by the public sector High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), which consists of the senior officials of the Departments of the Taoiseach, of Finance, of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, of Education &amp;amp; Skills, of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade, and the CEOs of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. The strategy is also supported by an Industry Advisory Committee, which consists of representatives of Irish and international IFS companies. The HLIC and the IAC meet quarterly as the Joint Committee. </p>  <p>  The Ireland for Finance (IFF) Strategy includes a commitment under Action 15 (Resourcing of the Department of Finance) to ensure the optimal resources are in place to deliver the objectives of the Ireland for Finance strategy and this is monitored on a continuous basis.</p>  <p>  A dedicated International Financial Services (IFS) Unit works on the Ireland for Finance strategy and operates as the Secretariat to the various IFF Committees.  It also coordinates work on IFS with other parts of the Department and the Permanent Representation to the European Union in Brussels. In the promotion of the Ireland for Finance strategy abroad, the IFS Unit act as the key liaison point with the Embassies, Consulates, and the international offices of the Enterprise Agencies, (IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland). It also works closely domestically and internationally with individual businesses, their advisors, and industry representative organisations.</p>  <p>  Apart from the dedicated IFS Unit, responsibility for IFS issues is spread across different areas of the Department with associated resourcing, namely: Financial Services Division; Banking Division; and International Finance Division.  Financial Services Division covers funds and asset management, along with insurance.  Banking Division covers banking and payments, while International Finance Division covers Sustainable Finance, FinTech and RegTech.  In addition, there is input from Legal Services and the Department&rsquo;s Financial Advisory Services across the range of international financial services on particular issues.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Finance recently advertised a position for a Communications/Media Manager role who will be appointed in the near future.  This role will be involved in the promotion of IFS with the two Enterprise Agencies and our Embassy network.  An external PR company has also been recently appointed to assist with particular aspects of IFS promotional work.</p></reply>

The development of the regions is one of the priorities of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  There were approximately 44,000 people in direct employment in the IFS sector at the end of 2018 with one-third of these jobs located outside Dublin.  The sector has a significant presence in a number of regional locations including Cavan, Clare, Cork, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Leitrim, Limerick, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.</p>  <p>  A number of international financial services companies have chosen to build centres of excellence in these regional locations, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the higher staff retention rates associated with operations outside of Dublin.  Close connectivity to educational institutions and the development of like-minded business lines in a particular regional hub are also important factors why companies locate in these areas.</p>  <p>  The two Enterprise Agencies (IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland) actively promote the advantage of regional locations to both existing and target clients.  IDA Ireland has an active &lsquo;second site&rsquo; strategy where companies in Dublin are encouraged and supported to establish a second office in a regional location. </p>  <p>  Groups such as State Street in Kilkenny, Northern Trust in Limerick, MetLife in Galway and First Data in Nenagh have successfully established a regional presence through this channel.  </p>  <p>  Other public sector bodies that are identified in Ireland for Finance as supporting the Enterprise Agencies include my Department and the nine Regional Skills Fora. At an upcoming meeting, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will provide an update on employment figures for Q4 of 2019 to the public sector High Level Implementation Committee, which is chaired by Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD.</p>  <p>  However, significant announcements during the year have included the opening of Fundrock&rsquo;s regional second site in Limerick, where it intends to employ 45 people; Rimes&rsquo; decision to establish its first office in Cork; and Japanese company JRI America Inc.&rsquo;s announcement to further expand its Technology Centre in Tralee, Co. Kerry, creating 100 new jobs over 5 years. </p>  <p>  Carne Global, an Irish founded global provider of fund management company solutions to the asset management industry, announced a significant expansion in its Irish operations earlier this year, creating an additional 250 regional jobs over the next three years in the South East.</p>  <p>  Opus Fund Services recently announced its decision to establish a regional second site in Wexford, creating 100 jobs while Liberty Insurance announced a 120-person expansion of its office in Cavan in addition to the announcement by DMS Governance that it is to create 50 further jobs in Cashel. </p>  <p>  The employment target in Ireland for Finance is to reach 50,000 people in direct employment in the sector by 2025.</p></reply>

To date contributions amounting to some &euro;236 million have been made, in the form of cash, counselling and property transfers.  </p><p>Some &euro;125 million of the &euro;128 million provided for under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement has been contributed with the transfer of two properties remaining to be fully completed. The cash and counselling contributions received under the Agreement, amounting to some &euro;65 million, were made on a collective basis and accordingly it is not possible to identify the amounts paid by individual congregations. </p><p>The offers made in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report included cash and properties and were valued by the congregations at &euro;352.6 million. However, when account is taken of offers not accepted and changes in the valuation of properties previously offered and the value of properties offered but not being reckoned as a contribution are taken into account, the total value of the voluntary offers achievable will be lower than the amount of &euro;352.6 million offered. The Religious Sisters of Charity has advised that it was waiving its claim for legal costs from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA) and offsetting this claim against the remaining cash contribution of &euro;3m. The Oblates of Mary Immaculate has advised that it did not seek legal costs from CICA while the Presentation Brothers has refunded its CICA legal costs of &euro;600,000.</p><p>Some &euro;111 million of the &euro;352.6 million offered has been received to date, including &euro;108.4 million in cash together with added interest, and properties valued at &euro;2.8 million. Valuations in respect of a number of properties that have fully transferred have yet to be received. The &euro;108.4 million in cash has been contributed by 15 congregations. A final cash payment of &euro;2 million is expected to be received from the Congregation of Christian Brothers in December 2019, while an additional contribution of &euro;1 million is expected to be received from the Presentation Brothers in 2020/2021.

It also enhances their understanding of life and culture in the Gaeltacht and the reality of life in bilingual communities. </p>  <p>  I was very pleased therefore that Budget 2020 includes a commitment to restore the Gaeltacht grant for students in State-funded primary initial teacher education programmes.  The measure will take effect from the academic year 2020/2021. </p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  -  Utilising existing unused capacity within  a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).  While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Skerries school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.  </p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the enrolment issues in the Skerries area for 2020.  In this context, my Department has been in direct contact with the Patron of Skerries Community College in respect of the capacity in the school.  Skerries Community College has expressed a willingness to increase its long-term projected enrolment to 1,000 pupils. As a result a permanent extension consisting of 3 general classrooms, 3 SET/Offices, Science Laboratory and prep area, Art room and toilets has been approved by my Department.</p>  <p>  Pending the delivery of the permanent extension my Department has also approved interim temporary accommodation consisting of 3 mainstream classrooms with toilets along with the converting an existing space to create a Science laboratory. The Patron of Skerries Community College is currently tendering for the interim accommodation approved. It is expected to have all interim accommodation in place for September 2020.</p></reply>

Goal 3 of the Plan is to &ldquo;gather accurate data and evidence on access and participation and to base policy on what that data tells us&rdquo;. The HEA&rsquo;s recently published Spatial and Socio-Economic Profile of Higher Education Institutions in Ireland arises from the implementation of this goal and the publication of a data access plan in 2018. The report enhances understanding of how socio-economic background and levels of disadvantage have impacted on rates of participation in higher education.</p>  <p>  The findings in the report show the extent of diversity of the student population in our higher education institutions as well as the diversity of the institutions. This is the first year this type of data is available so it is only possible to establish trends when more years of data become available.</p>  <p>  This report is not the only source of data in relation to the socio-economic background of our higher education student population. The socio-economic data where we have an established trend shows that there are improvements being made in access to higher education from target socio-economic groups. Specifically, the Progress Review of the National Access Plan published in December 2018 showed an increase in participation by people disadvantaged by socio-economic backgrounds in the following groups:</p>  <p>  Non-manual worker group: 23% in 2012/13, 27% in 2016/17</p>  <p>  Semi/unskilled manual worker group: 26% in 2012/13, 36% in 2016/17</p>  <p>  It is also important to recognise and acknowledge that higher education is not the only option for school leavers. Further education, apprenticeships and progression to the labour market are all equally important, valid and worthwhile alternative options.</p>  <p>  A number of initiatives are in place to support increased participation in higher education by under-represented groups including those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and communities e.g. Student Assistance Fund, HEAR, and the more recent PATH Fund.</p>  <p>  The report provides a key evidence base that will help policymakers in the HEA and Department of Education and Skills as well access services in higher education institutions to develop a better understanding of the levels of socio-economic disadvantage in our communities and regions. In particular, the data in the report will support institutions to develop more targeted approaches to widening access in their regions.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for personnel matters and the distribution of personnel across the various Garda Divisions.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.  I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a record &euro;1.76 billion was allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019 and this is increasing to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for 2020.  With the benefit of this investment, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation.  We currently have approximately 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff. A further almost 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are scheduled to attest as members tomorrow, 29 November.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, there is also ongoing recruitment of Garda staff.  </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table sets out the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on a national level as at 31 October 2018 and 31 October 2019.  <table>    <tr>       <th>G.N.I.B.</th>       <th>Garda</th>       <th>Sergeant</th>       <th>Inspector</th>       <th>Superintendent</th>       <th>Chief Superintendent</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>31/10/2018</td>       <td>96</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>116</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>31/10/2019</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>114</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am further advised that there were 18 Garda staff members assigned to the Garda National Immigration Bureau at 31 October 2018 and this number remains unchanged at 31 October 2019. </p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct involvement in the matter.</p>  <p>  Subject to final approval by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, successful applicants from these campaigns are considered first for intakes into the Garda College, in accordance with the candidate's place on the Order of Merit. There is no set time frame for offers to applicants as this is dependent on their files being fully completed and the intake dates into the Garda College. All applicants remain on the panel until such time as they are offered a place in the Garda College, with the exception of those who are deemed unsuitable, fail the Medical or Physical Competence Test (PCT) or withdraw from the competition.</p>  <p>  I would advise any candidate for a position as a Garda trainee to contact the PAS or the Garda Appointments Office, depending on the relevant stage of the application process, if they have any queries in relation to their application.</p></reply>

This approach focused on delivering supports and services that citizens need, in a format that was accessible and relevant for visitors.  This aligns with the new ways of working central to Our Public Service 2020, the framework for development and innovation in Ireland's public service, and to the Civil Service Renewal Plan. These new ways of working seek to embed public service reform into operational and delivery systems through citizen-focused design.</p>  <p>  This approach to the cross-Government presence brought an increased level of coordination, cohesion and alignment between Government Departments, agencies and State-supported bodies at the NPC.  It also focused on maximising the value and quality of supports and services provided to NPC visitors.  For the first time, over 150 exhibitors were located in the one area, &ldquo;The Government of Ireland Village&rdquo;, and Government stands across Departments, agencies and bodies were grouped in marquees and tents on the basis of the supports, services and policy areas they are responsible for.</p>  <p>  While there was no dedicated Departmental stand during the period in question, a number of agencies under the remit of my Department had their own stands or were present at other stands, reflecting the broad range of work carried out in the Justice sector.  I have referred your request to the relevant agencies for their direct response to provide further detail.</p>  <p>  All of the Department&rsquo;s online and offline advertising was developed internally and, as such, no additional external costs were incurred.</p>  <p>  The NPC provides an important opportunity to provide advice and guidance to citizens about many issues under the remit of my Department including safety. This year, for example, at the NPC I formally launched the National Rural Safety Forum - a collaborative partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my own Department and a wide range of partners including the IFA and Muintir an T&iacute;re. Its objectives include information sharing and community engagement on crime prevention. </p>  <p>  I attend the National Ploughing Championships every year including since I became Minister for Justice and Equality. The then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald T.D. attended in 2016. Generally, the Minister is accompanied by their Private Secretary at the event.  A member of staff from the Department's Press and Communications Office would also be present as part of their normal duties in connection with publicising the work of the Department and the agencies under its remit.</p>  <p>  All staff in question are entitled to travel and subsistence payments in connection with their attendance in line with civil service guidelines.</p></reply>

Responding to the needs of victims has seen the rollout of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs) with specially trained officers responsible for investigations, including engagement with victims. These Units will support the delivery of a consistent and professional approach to the investigation of sexual and domestic crime. 13 DPSUs have now been rolled out and I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that they will be in place nationwide by the end of Quarter 1, 2020. </p>  <p>  The introduction of these measures supported Ireland&rsquo;s ratification this year of the Istanbul Convention (the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence), which I announced on International Women's Day last March.  </p>  <p>  In May the Government supported my proposal to commission a study into familicide and domestic homicide reviews. This independent, specialist research will look at two particular issues:</p>  <p>  - the provision of supports to families who are victims of familicide; and</p>  <p>  - international best practice in the conduct of Domestic Homicide Reviews.</p>  <p>  Norah Gibbons is leading the study with Grainne McMorrow SC and Forensic Criminologist Dr Jane Monckton Smith. This team brings vast experience and a wide specialist expertise and included a period for consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including State agencies, family members of victims and NGOs.</p>  <p>  While familicide is relatively rare in Ireland, these events have a devastating impact on those left behind, both family members and the wider community. The study will examine how such supports can be provided in a more systemic and integrated way. The study will attempt to ensure that victims of familicide are supported in as compassionate and timely a way as possible; as well as how local communities who experience the horror of familicide cases in their local areas can be best supported.</p>  <p>  In parallel to that study, in the context of the categorisation and recording of homicides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently conducting a review of the investigation of certain homicides which includes a number of domestic homicides. </p>  <p>  Separately to this, An Garda Sioch&aacute;na is developing policies and procedures to inform the overall policing approach to domestic homicides.  This includes a Domestic Homicide Review Team in the Garda National Protective Services Bureau examining a small number of domestic homicides of relevance for review. The purpose of such reviews is to examine what lessons, if any, should be learned and what potential changes to relevant policing policy and procedures should be introduced. It is intended that such a course of action will result in an improved response by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the handling of domestic violence and/or abuse into the future and ultimately reduce the number of domestic related homicides in our society.</p></reply>

Reckonable residency is reflected in the corresponding stamp 1, stamp 3 or stamp 4 endorsements in a person's passport. To meet the statutory residency criteria as laid out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 (as amended), an individual needs to have 60 months (5 years) reckonable residency with the year immediately before the date of application being of continuous residency. </p>  <p>  The minor the Deputy has referred to would not be entitled to a passport as he or she was born in the state after 1 January 2005 and were not entitled to Irish Citizenship at the time of birth.  However, if at the time of the birth one of his or her parents had been a resident in the state for a period of 4 years immediately preceding the birth, the child would have been entitled to Irish citizenship.  </p>  <p>  An application may be submitted for a minor if the minor's parents have already been naturalised or if the minor is of Irish descent or has Irish associations or, at the time of their birth, was not entitled to Irish Citizenship but has since accumulate 5 years' reckonable residency in the state.</p>  <p>  Minors cannot apply for naturalisation by themselves. The application must be made by their parent, legal guardian or person acting on the child's behalf "in loco parentis". </p>  <p>  Further information on applying for naturalisation can be found on my Departments website www.inis.gov.ie.  </p>  <p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Legal aid is available to persons who satisfy the financial eligibility criteria laid down in that Act and in the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2017. Principally, the person must have disposable income of less than &euro;18,000 per annum and disposable capital assets of less than &euro;100,000 (excluding the home in which they live). The person&rsquo;s case must also satisfy the merits criteria laid down under that Act. These criteria include if the applicant is reasonably likely to be successful in the proceedings and if having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the cost to the Board as against the benefit to the applicant, it is reasonable to grant legal aid.</p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board is bound to apply the financial eligibility and merits criteria to all cases.  While I as Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, can disapply the financial eligibility criteria by means of an amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996, I cannot disapply the merits criteria in such a manner under the Act.  </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides particular provisions in relation to legal aid for what are termed &ldquo;relevant persons&rdquo; (RPs) under the Act. The provisions would effectively remove the means criteria for RPs and apply what is known as the &ldquo;reduced merits&rdquo; criteria (the same criteria applicable in cases involving the welfare of a child, i.e. that the prospects of success and reasonableness tests are removed). It also provides for a mechanism for recovering costs in cases where legal aid is granted to an RP who would have been financially ineligible for legal services. These provisions are contingent on the commencement of Part 5 of the 2015 Act and are not worded in such a way that they could be applied to the provisions of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act1871.</p>  <p>  When the court considers it appropriate it can appoint a Guardian ad Litem to represent the voice of the Ward in Court. If funds are not available to cover the Ward's costs associated with this appointment, they are borne by the Courts Service, Health Service Executive or the Child and Family Agency. If the Health Service Executive or the Child and Family Agency seeks the appointment of a Guardian ad Litem, they bear the costs of the appointment.</p>  <p>  In relation to fully commencing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, as the Deputy will be aware, the Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the DSS. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016) commenced provisions of the Act to enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the DSS in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018). </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. </p>  <p>  Work has been ongoing in my Department on the drafting of necessary amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, taking account of issues raised by the Mental Health Commission, the codes of practice working groups and submissions received from other bodies.  The intention was to bring forward these amendments by way of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016. However, when D&aacute;il Committee Stage took place on the Bill on 30 January 2019, a number of amendments were agreed which had previously been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, thus giving rise to a procedural matter. Work is ongoing to resolve this issue.  </p></reply>

The DTIF has been established under the responsibility of my Department with Enterprise Ireland providing administrative support. The first call was run in 2018 with successful projects announced in December 2018.</p><p>Applications for funding under DTIF Call 2 are currently being assessed by independent international experts. I expect to be able to announce the successful projects in the coming weeks. </p><p>Given the unique nature of the Fund, which in Call 1 alone is supporting 27 consortia comprised of 100 organisations, including SMEs, Research Performing Organisations and multinationals, intensive contract negotiations have been ongoing since the successful projects were announced in December 2018. </p><p>To facilitate payments to the constituent organisations, Enterprise Ireland have developed new consortia agreements and a new pre-finance framework was put in place. Letters of offer and consortia agreements have now issued to all of the successful project partners. Payments to those organisations, including those that are eligible for pre-financing, continue to be processed once the formal legal documentation is signed off and returned to Enterprise Ireland. </p><p>For the most part, enterprise partners in DTIF collaborations will receive grant payments retrospectively following submission of validated claims for vouched expenditure. As most projects did not commence until mid-2019 at earliest, the payments to enterprise partners will not begin in significant numbers until early in 2020. The payments that have been made to enterprise partners relate mainly to pre-finance payments to a number of small enterprises.</p><p>Research Performing Organisations (i.e. higher education institutions and other public research bodies) can receive a share of their funding upon project commencement. Most of the &euro;20m available for DTIF Call 1 projects will be allocated to these RPOs with 34 such payments having been made to date.  </p><p>The current position is that &euro;12.2m of payments have been processed with another &euro;5m of drawdown requests in train.  The &euro;12.2m includes &euro;9.6m to RPOs and &euro;2.6m to enterprise partners. A breakdown of the &euro;9.6m payments to RPOs by county is set out in the attached DTIF Payments table.  </p><p>&euro;2.6m of pre-finance payments have been issued to some small companies. It is not proposed to publish details of the pre-finance for small companies by county at this point as there are relatively small numbers involved and this could reveal information that is commercially sensitive to the companies concerned</p><p>Detail on payments to all DTIF partner organisations (RPOS and enterprises) will be provided from 2020 once enterprise partners start making their claims for vouched expenditure.

The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation.  From 1st August 2013, the Contergan Foundation substantially increased its monthly payments to thalidomide survivors, including Irish survivors.  There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of ex-gratia monthly payments from my Department.</p>  <p>  Both the German payments and the Irish ex-gratia payments made to the survivors are exempt from tax, including DIRT and are not reckonable as means for the purpose of Social Welfare payments.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump sum and monthly payments for life, the supports provided to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment, housing adaptations and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services.</p>  <p>  There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive to act as a liaison with regard to the ongoing health and personal social service needs of Irish survivors. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that it is open to any Irish person to apply to the Contergan Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors, as outlined above.</p></reply>

This contains mandatory requirements in regard to the provision of nutrition labelling in pre-packaged foods. </p>  <p>  The Regulation also provides that EU Member States can recommend use, within their own territory, of a voluntary scheme which provides additional forms of expression or presentation of nutritional information for specified nutrients on the front-of-pack (FOP) of a product, once the proposed scheme meets certain criteria. There is currently no harmonised legislation at EU level on front-of-pack labelling (FOP). </p>  <p>  In 2016, the Department of Health published an 'Obesity Policy and Action Plan for 2016-2025' which included an action point to review EU consumer information labelling of food products and with a view to its application in the Irish market. This issue will be considered in due course by the national Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG). </p></reply>

Community pharmacy is recognised as the most accessible element of our health service with an unequalled reach in terms of patient contact and access, regardless of their geographic location or status as either an independent retailer or as part of a larger chain of providers.</p>  <p>  The regulations governing the current pharmacy fee structure were made under section 9 of the FEMPI Act 2009 and are set to expire at the end of 2019. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, these regulations must be replaced on 1 January 2020 to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date. The fees to be set are determined by the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  In keeping with my obligations under Section 43 of the 2017 Act, Department of Health officials have begun a process of consultation with the IPU, as the representative body, prior to the introduction of new fee regulations. My officials have met with an IPU delegation on two occasions and a detailed submission was received from the IPU on 8 November.</p>  <p>  That submission is currently being considered by my Department in the context of the statutory fee-setting process as referred to.</p>  <p>  In May of this year I addressed the Irish Pharmaceutical Union at the National Pharmacy Conference and gave a commitment to move beyond the arrangements underpinned by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (FEMPI) with a view to optimising the role of pharmacists in the years ahead. It is my intention to open contract discussions in 2020 which will assist to deliver on the commitment given.</p></reply>

The strategy is underpinned by a partnership approach between the statutory, non-statutory and community and voluntary sectors. </p><p>Drug and alcohol task forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem in local communities. They ensure that a coordinated approach is taken across all sectors to address substance misuse based on the identified needs and priorities in their areas.  </p><p>The task forces oversee an annual budget of &euro;28m from the Department of Health and the HSE. This funding supports over 280 community projects, in local areas and communities throughout the country, to support initiatives to tackle drug and alcohol use and misuse.</p><p>Additional funding of &euro;1m has been provided for the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy in 2019. This included &euro;480,000 to provide an additional &euro;20,000 for each of the 24 Task Forces, &euro;10,000 of which will be on a permanent recurring basis. It also funds 13 strategic initiatives to respond to emerging trends in substance misuse and to improve access to services for people with complex needs. The initiatives were developed by task forces in conjunction with community healthcare organisations. </p><p>The Department of Health provides annual funding of over &euro;200,000 to support, develop and facilitate the involvement of communities in the local and national structures for implementing the National Drugs Strategy.  In addition, there are 11 community and voluntary representatives on the oversight structures of the strategy.  </p><p>I am committed to implementing an integrated public health response to substance misuse. Working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary sectors is central to this response, and I am confident the new strategic initiatives will have a positive impact and make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives as they journey to recovery.</p><p>The decision earlier this year to introduce a health diversion programme for persons in possession of drugs for personal use is a hugely important step in developing a public health approach to drug use. It delivers on a person-centred approach to harm reduction, which will benefit individuals and communities affected drug use. I am very pleased that we are delivering on this key commitment in the National Drugs Strategy.</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p><p>There are three main steps to the application process:</p><p>- Step 1 is an application for a Care Needs Assessment. The Care Needs Assessment identifies whether or not the person needs long-term nursing home care. This is a key criteria and the HSE cannot make a determination on an application for State support under the Scheme unless a determination has been made that the person needs the relevant care services.  </p><p>- Step 2<b></b>is an application for State Support. This is used to complete the Financial Assessment by the HSE which assesses the person&rsquo;s contribution to care and his/her corresponding level of financial assistance. The Financial Assessment takes account of a person&rsquo;s income and assets in order to determine the person&rsquo;s contribution to their care. </p><p>- Step 3 is the decision to approve financial support for the applicant under the scheme.</p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.</p><p>Applicants to the Scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home. However, in order for financial support to be provided, the nursing home must have an available bed and be able to cater for the applicant's particular need. The HSE's Nursing Homes Support Offices can advise an applicant on the options available to them.</p></reply>

Part of the remit of the Strategy Group was to consider the case for a possible re-opening of the Organic Farming Scheme. They recommended that it should be re-opened but on a targeted basis. The sectors targeted were areas for which there is a clear market demand, and which are critical to the further development of the Organic Sector, namely horticulture, cereals and dairy. This recommendation acknowledged that the budget was very limited given the success of the current scheme and the overall spending within the RDP.</p><p>The Scheme was opened for applications up to the 19 December 2018 and a total of 225 applications were received. A total of 58 applications were either withdrawn or were deemed ineligible.  Following the ranking and selection process, one applicant withdrew, 55 were successful and 111 farmers received letters informing them that they had been unsuccessful.  All unsuccessful applicants were given a right of appeal to the Organic Unit of my Department. It should be noted that, in 95% of the unsuccessful applications, the predominant enterprises were not from the targeted sectors identified when the Scheme was launched.</p><p>The breakdown by sector of the successful applicants is set out in the table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Sector</th>       <th>Number</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cereals</td>       <td>24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dairy</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Beef</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Horticulture</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Lamb</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>55</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Under current RDP rules, the latest date that the Organic Farming Scheme could commence under this RDP was 1 January 2019. The targeted Scheme re-opened on the 19 November 2018 and closed for applications on 19 December 2018.  The terms and conditions of the Scheme state that the number of applications to be accepted into the Scheme will be determined by funding. Applicants would therefore have been aware that, as with many schemes, the submission of a valid application did not guarantee entry to the Scheme and any expense they undertook before entry to the Scheme was at their own risk.</p><p>As part of the eligibility process applicants were required to submit a BPS application, which had a closing date of 15 May 2019, and also had to submit their Organic training certificate by 1 September 2019.  The determination of eligible applications and the ranking and selection process could only commence following the deadline for receipt of educational certification. </p><p>It is important to note that this was a targeted re-opening and that I fully expect that there will be a new Organics Scheme under the next CAP. I would encourage all stakeholders to make their views known on the shape of this future scheme as part of the wider CAP consultation process.</p></reply>

The principles governing State aid are enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, mainly in Articles 107-109.  These provisions provide for a general prohibition on the use of State aid, subject to certain exceptions, the interpretation of which are largely the preserve of the European Commission, subject to the jurisprudence of the European Courts.</p>  <p>  However, if an EU Member State has identified an area of market failure and feels that it is justified to provide an incentive effect in the form of State aid in a particular area, Member States must notify the Commission of proposed State aid in advance and seek the Commission&rsquo;s advance approval before the aid can be paid.  There are a few exceptions to the notification requirement, namely:</p>  <p>  -  If the measure falls within the General De Minimis Regulation which allows overall aid of less   than 200,000 euros over 3 fiscal years.</p>  <p>  -  Agricultural de minimis aid to farmers of less than 20,000 euros over 3 fiscal years.</p>  <p>  -  Measures which are covered under a pre-existing approved Irish Scheme. </p>  <p>  -  Measures falling within the General Block Exemption Regulation.</p>  <p>  State Aid approval was requested and received from the European Commission for the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 in 2014. The Forestry Programme is 100% State aid funded and is therefore required to fully comply with all relevant State Aid Guidelines, notably European Union Guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas 2014 to 2020 (2014/C 204/01), issued by the European Commission and applicable to the 2014-2020 programming period. </p>  <p>  My Department's Afforestation Scheme is part of the Forestry Programme. In accordance with the relevant State aid provisions, the scheme terms &amp;amp; conditions set out that a fixed afforestation grant towards the costs, subject to the maximum laid down in the scheme documents, will be available to private land-holders, companies or public entities. Aid for the afforestation of state owned lands may be granted but only if the body managing such land is a private body or a municipality. Land owned and managed by public entities will not be eligible for payment of premiums.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the European Commission will issue new State aid Guidelines for the next programming period (2021-2027). The first step of the consultation on the new State aid rules with the Member States has been initiated by the European Commission earlier this year and my Department is participating in this process.  In consideration of the new national afforestation targets, all aspects of how forestry is grant aided will be under review during the coming years in preparation for the next Forestry Programme. </p></reply>

As previously outlined by Minister Madigan, the issue of afforestation within SPAs important to breeding hen harrier, is an ongoing issue and a previous protocol on the issue was discontinued as the European Commission considered it non-compliant with the EU Birds Directive. </p>  <p>  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has prepared a draft Hen Harrier Threat Response Plan in co-operation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and with my own Department. The draft Threat Response Plan must also undergo public consultation.</p>  <p>  Regarding the issuing of afforestation licences, the Deputy will be aware that, under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, any Minister considering a plan or project in a SPA or a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) shall give consent for such a plan or project only after having determined that the plan or project shall not adversely affect the integrity of any SPA or SAC.  In addition, under the European Union guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas, within SPAs and SACs, only afforestation consistent with the management objectives of the Natura sites concerned, and agreed with the Member State&rsquo;s authority in charge of implementing Natura 2000 (in Ireland&rsquo;s case, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht), shall be allowed.</p></reply>

Reducing emissions by water table manipulation has the potential to significantly reduce GHG emissions from these soils and is a means to positively contribute to our climate change mitigation ambitions. This is an important part of Agriculture's contribution to the emission reductions and is set out in the All of Government Climate Action Plan, released in June 2019, as highlighted in the targets set for the Agriculture, Forestry and Land-use sector.</p><p>In this respect, the Climate Action Plan sets out a target of at least 40,000 ha of reduced management intensity of grasslands on drained organic soils to 2030.This will contribute 4.4 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq cumulative abatement of the overall target of 26.8 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq abatement through Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry actions over the period 2021 to 2030. The removal of carbon from the atmosphere through measures such as afforestation and the reduced management of peatlands are extremely important contributions towards achieving our national climate targets.</p><p>Action 132 of the Climate Action Plan demonstrates the necessary steps we must take to reach these targets and includes the identification of carbon rich soils currently under agricultural management as well as the actions required to reduce carbon losses and improve sequestration from them. My Department has been assigned &euro;3 million to carry out relevant research in respect of carbon removal, which will include at its forefront peatland management measures. My Department will engage with farmers as to how to implement and understand the best management practices for better management of peatlands and their carbon rich soils.</p></reply>

The Government Statement on the role of data centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy, 2018 recognises that a plan-led approach is needed to develop a range of measures to promote regional options for data centre investment, minimising the need for additional grid infrastructure.</p>  <p>  While data centres have until recent time accounted for less than 2% of Ireland&rsquo;s total electricity demand, EirGrid, in their Generation Capacity Statement 2019-2028, project that demand from data centres could account for 29% of all demand by 2028. EirGrid, in its capacity as the transmission system operator, continually model and forecast the predicted future growth of electricity demand in their published analysis such as Tomorrow's Energy Scenarios, which is available on their website at www.eirgrid.com </p>  <p>  While data centres consume very large amounts of energy they have a flat, predictable demand profile meaning that they use the same amount of electricity day and night and therefore require a range of generation technologies to meet their demand. Significant increases in volumes of generation capacity, including from renewable energy sources, will be required to meet Ireland&rsquo;s electrification objectives and demand from heat pumps, electric vehicles and data centres. The Climate Action Plan sets out a number of actions to ensure that data centres are accommodated in a sustainable manner. </p>  <p>  Corporate power purchasing of renewable energy by large energy users will also be critical to supplying data centre demand as will ensuring that large demand connections are regionally balanced to minimise grid reinforcements and the costs to consumers.</p></reply>

Broader Government policy, including carbon pricing, and grant supports offered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, will play an important role in driving the changes required to reduce greenhouse gases at individual and business levels. </p>  <p>  I am also confident that informed citizens will play a crucial role in the choices that they make in regard to climate action. The Climate Action Plan, therefore, addresses the role of citizen engagement and community leadership. The related actions include enhancing the effectiveness of climate-related communications, network building, and developing deliberative capacity, including through the National Dialogue on Climate Change (NDCA). </p>  <p>  Communications and engagement will be closely intertwined with policy changes to be delivered. It will rest on three key elements:</p>  <p>  - persuasive, consistent and effective external-facing communications on climate change and the need for action, including specific details on what the state is doing and what individuals can do to contribute;</p>  <p>  - engagement designed to empower communities, that builds on the Climate Action Regional Roadshows, and quickly leads to mobilisation, capacity building and local action, and</p>  <p>  - efficient exchange of information within the civil and public service, including all relevant commercial semi-state companies, directly related to supporting the Government&rsquo;s climate action objectives.</p>  <p>  The overall objective of this approach is create a long- term process to communicate with citizens on the national objective of transitioning to a low carbon, climate resilient society and economy by 2050 in which every citizen has a role to play. </p>  <p>  Engagements, on a regional and local basis have already taken place, with stakeholders in Athlone, Tralee and Kildare. I have also held a series of regional town hall meetings since the publication of the Climate Action Plan to gather views in relation to its implementation. In consultation with the EPA, I am currently developing a model for implementation of the next phase of the NDCA which will focus on local activation. </p>  <p>  Engaging youth is key to the driving and encouraging future behavioural changes and I am communicating with that generation through a number of strands, including supports for climate related activity for Green Schools, and ECO-UNESCO. Government is also establishing a dedicated National Youth Council for Climate Action and Climate Justice. The Council will be established by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in close partnership with my own Department. Furthermore, the Government, through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, has allocated in Budget 2020 for a new special fund for youth action on climate justice to enhance channels for direct engagement between young people and decision makers across Government and beyond. The overall goal will be to assist young people to engage in enduring dialogue with decision-makers, and support initiatives which are both youth-led and respond to the issues raised by young people.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the recent initiative of the Oireachtas to hold the Youth Assembly on 15 November. It is heartening to see the active engagement and mobilisation to the climate crisis which is, without doubt, the defining challenge of our generation. I thank the members of the Youth Assembly for their recommendations for action to stop climate breakdown which I am currently considering.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture sector has strong green credentials and a positive international reputation in terms of carbon efficiency. However, given the contribution of agriculture to overall national greenhouse gas emissions, a shift in the sector is needed and achieving this objective will be a significant challenge facing Irish agriculture over the coming decades.</p>  <p>  Significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through meeting the targets set out for the agriculture sector in the Climate Action Plan. To achieve these targets, the Plan sets out a range of actions to reduce emissions on farms, promote afforestation and diversification of land use, develop opportunities in the bio-economy and in the supply of substitutes for fossil fuels, promote better management of peatlands and soils, and develop clusters of best practice. </p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has recently launched a public consultation on a draft National Climate and Air Roadmap for the Agriculture Sector to 2030 and Beyond. This consultation aims to address the issue of emission reduction targets while meeting the high ambitions of the Irish agriculture sector. It recognises the important role of the next Common Agricultural Policy, which is to have a strong climate ambition and will be implemented in Ireland through the development of a strategic plan for the period 2021 to 2027.</p></reply>

In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 76% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband.</p>  <p>  On 19 November, the Government signed the contract with National Broadband Ireland (NBI) to provide access to high speed broadband to the 1.1 million people living and working in 537,537 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms and 695 schools, where commercial operators will not commit to deliver the service. </p>  <p>  The solution provided by NBI will meet and in some cases exceed, the parameters of the Intervention Strategy and European targets. The NBP will contribute to the EU strategic objectives set out in the Digital Agenda for Europe and in the Communication "Towards a European Gigabit Society".</p>  <p>  National Broadband Ireland will set up a wholesale open access company dedicated to the rollout of a predominantly fibre to the premises (FTTP) network in the Intervention Area, which will be capable of delivering a future-proofed high speed broadband network, initially providing services of 150Mbps to the majority of homes and up to 1Gbps to heavy data users and Small and Medium size Enterprises.</p>  <p>  Work by NBI will begin immediately and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p>  <p>  Approximately 300 community centres, schools, library hubs and local sports halls across every county in Ireland will be connected to high speed broadband during 2020, to enable communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband. </p>  <p>  By the end of 2021, NBI plans to pass approximately 115,000 premises. Approximately 70,000-100,000 premises will be passed each year thereafter, with the final premises to be completed in 2026.</p>  <p>  Previous government initiatives to deliver or improve broadband service in the State include the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS), the Galway-Mayo Telecoms Duct, the Metropolitan Area Networks and the Schools 100Mbps Project. </p>  <p>  The National and Rural Broadband Schemes were designed to deliver basic, affordable broadband to target areas across the country where premises were unable to obtain a service from a commercial operator. These initiatives were concluded in 2014 and 2011, respectively. </p>  <p>  The NBP State intervention network, when complete, will push Ireland to the forefront of connectivity, both on a European and an international level. </p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations.</p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing efforts to improve mobile telephony coverage nationally, the Programme for Government specifically included a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016 containing 40 actions to alleviate some of the coverage deficits across the country. An Implementation Group is overseeing the implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. The Implementation Group meets on a quarterly basis and publishes quarterly progress reports on the implementation status of actions. </p>  <p>  Now in its third year of operation, the Taskforce has addressed over 70 actions and continues to focus on issues that are negatively impacting upon the rollout of essential telecommunications infrastructure around the country. </p>  <p>  Various measures are underway under the aegis of the Taskforce which will address mobile coverage deficits, particularly in rural areas:</p>  <p>  - Work is ongoing in order to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy in the Department with regard to priorities for mobile phone service.</p>  <p>  - A working group has been investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - ComReg has published a composite national outdoor coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  - ComReg has developed a licensing exemption scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in areas currently experiencing a low level of service. </p></reply>

The Directive implements an Agreement between the General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the European Union (Cogeca), the European Transport Workers' Federation (ETF) and the Association of National Organization&rsquo;s of Fishing Enterprises in the European Union (Europ&ecirc;che). These organisations represent the employer and employee representative organisations in the fishing sector across the European Union.  As the agreement is a social partnership agreement, the Directive merely implements the Agreement as agreed between the social partners in 2012, and the Agreement itself was not subject to any changes during the discussions on the Directive in the Social Questions Working Party. My Department is supportive of the objective of the Directive to enhance the working and living conditions for fishers working on vessels registered in an EU Member State.</p><p>An important aspect of the transposition of the Directive is the requirement for consultation with stakeholders.  On 16 November 2018, my Department published Marine Notice 42 of 2018, which invited stakeholders to contribute their views on Council Directive (EU) 2017/159. The consultation process resulted in the Department receiving seven submissions, which were reviewed and published on the Department&rsquo;s website ().  Subsequently, my officials met with representatives of the various fisheries organisations to discuss the transposition of the Directive. The outcome from the Department&rsquo;s consultations with stakeholders made an important contribution to the drafting of the package of Regulations required to ensure the transposition of the Directive.</p><p>On 9 October, my Department issued Marine Notice 42 of 2019, to provide key stakeholders with a brief overview of some of the main changes that will come into effect subject to the finalisation of the draft legislation. Any queries or concerns raised in relation to transposition of Directive 2017/159, since the publication of Marine Notice 42 of 2019, have been responded to by my Department. </p><p>My Department has been working on a package of regulations in order to transpose Council Directive (EU) 2017/159. Work is at an advanced stage and it is hoped that these regulations will be signed into law in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.</p>  <p>  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for road improvement projects would have been considered as part of the Specific Improvement, and Strategic Regional and Local Road Grant Schemes. However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the recession meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some time to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes. The primary focus is on implementation of the 12 regional and local road projects identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  Any additional projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  </p>  <p>  Under the capital project appraisal process a Preliminary Appraisal has to be submitted in relation to each proposed project.  Once an appraisal is received it is assessed taking into account other competing projects, the overall regional and local road capital budget and the wider transport planning framework.</p>  <p>  A draft Preliminary Appraisal has been received from Meath County Council regarding traffic management in the Julianstown area.  This appraisal is currently being examined and the Department will be liaising with Meath County Council in relation to the further analysis required to underpin the assessment and costing of various options. </p></reply>

Louth is the statutory responsibility of Louth County Council, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  My Department has no project appraisal on hand in relation to the proposed Drogheda Northern Cross Port Access road, and as such no cost estimates have been submitted.</p>  <p>  Given the cutbacks in State funding for regional and local roads since the financial crisis, it has been necessary to curtail the grant programme for major new regional and local road schemes and for major realignment schemes in order to protect the funding available for the maintenance of the existing network. The bulk of the funding allocated under Project Ireland 2040 is, therefore, earmarked for the maintenance and renewal of the road network with some limited investment in the new projects.</p></reply>

As committed in both Project Ireland 2040 and the Transport Strategy itself, this re-evaluation will take account of new and planned development along the proposed route. Obviously the issue of estimated cost will form part of that re-evaluation.</p></reply>

The NDP does make provision for the implementation of 12 regional and local road improvement projects, subject to necessary approvals, in the period to 2023. Outside of that, some limited provision is being made in the regional and local road capital budget for the appraisal of a pipeline of upgrade projects.

The Department announced  in August this year that over 260 responses to the consultation had been received and that following on from consideration of the number and nature of the issues raised the Department had concluded that a further public inquiry is required. </p>  <p>  Earlier this month the Department for Infrastructure also announced that the Planning Appeals Commission has  been appointed to hold an inquiry into the A5 Environmental Statement Addendum 2019 and related environmental issues, along with the four updated draft reports to inform an Appropriate Assessment under the Habitats Regulations prepared by the Department.  It is understood that the inquiry will be held in February 2020.</p>  <p>  The current funding arrangements in relation to the A5 are governed by the Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan - A Fresh Start. Under this Agreement the Government is committed to provide funding of &pound;75 million (sterling) towards the cost of Phase 1a of the A5 upgrade scheme once the statutory planning process in Northern Ireland is concluded.  </p>  <p>  Allowing for the time required for the conclusion of the public inquiry and for a new  decision to be taken on whether to proceed with the scheme together with the possibility of a further legal challenge, the timeframe for the start of construction of Phase 1a of the A5 project is uncertain.  </p>  <p>  In addition it is envisaged that, as was the case for previous contributions, payments from the South will be based on an agreed protocol linked to the achievement of construction stage milestones. This  means that there would be a time lag between the construction start of the scheme and an initial payment by the South. </p>  <p>  In view of the current state of play in relation to the A5 scheme and the timeframes involved, provision was not made in 2019 and is not being made in the calendar year 2020 for funding for the scheme.  The Government remains committed to the &pound;75 million sterling contribution and the Senior Officials Group established on foot of the Fresh Start Agreement will continue to liaise regarding the project with a view to delivering on that commitment. </p>  <p>  In relation to the N2, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in the context of delivering the Government's commitments arising out of Project Ireland 2040, the planning, design, construction and improvement of individual national roads, is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. </p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the question to TII for a direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

It will deliver greater efficiency in the administration of a major, national Government scheme. It gives parents the possibility of (a) accessing subsidies via an online automated income assessment and (b) applying for subsidies using their mobile phone.  It is parent friendly.</p>  <p>  A secure identity verification system is required for any such IT system.  The Public Services Card and MyGovID offers this security.  It safeguards applicants' information and the administration of public funding.  Our priority is to direct funding to hard-pressed parents and not into administration.</p>  <p>  For those parents who wish to apply online but lack IT access or knowledge, help is available through their local Childcare Committee. DCYA has also been working with key stakeholders to support vulnerable families and will continue this work. Parents can also contact the Parent Support Centre which is available from 8am to 6pm Monday to Saturday - 01 9068530.</p>  <p>  There has been a very high volume of applications.  Over 8,400 applications, benefiting over 12,100 children, have been successfully submitted, with many more in train.</p></reply>

It is administered by Local Action Groups (LAGs) who deliver the programme across the country.</p><p>Total expenditure on the LEADER programme since it commenced - effectively in 2016 when the majority of Funding Agreements were signed with the LAGs - amounts to over &euro;73.4 million.  This comprises:</p><p>-  &euro;1.5 million in initial costs incurred by the LAGs to develop their Local Development Strategies.</p><p>-  &euro;32.6 million in administration costs of the LAGs and the cost of their engagement with communities to generate projects.</p><p>-  &euro;39.3 million on project expenditure. </p><p>The level of project activity under the LEADER programme has increased significantly since the start of 2018. Currently, over 2,500 projects have been approved for funding of over &euro;94.6 million.  A total of 1,007 projects have been approved to date in 2019 alone. </p><p>A further 352 applications, requesting an additional &euro;30.7 million, are at an earlier stage in the approvals process.</p><p>In addition, more than 100 Food and Co-operation projects have been approved at national level, outside of the core budget available to the LAGs.</p><p>Project payments have increased significantly in recent months as approved works have reached completion and claims have been submitted for payment. Over &euro;39.2 million of project expenditure has been incurred to date, &euro;26.1 million of that in 2019.</p><p>Over 1,000 or 40% of project promoters have now received a Final Payment in respect of their project application. The Programme is now delivering real and tangible results for communities right across rural Ireland and I am confident that the increased stream of project approvals by the LAGs and payment claims being submitted to my Department will continue at pace for the remainder of the programming period. </p><p>Table 1 provides a breakdown of the project payments made to date by each Local Action Group.

The Cooley Peninsula was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease. The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute (National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis) at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the CL&Aacute;R programme was closed for new applications in 2010.  However, I re-launched the programme in the second half of 2016, using as a base-line the areas identified in the work carried out by NIRSA. </p>  <p>  I have initiated a review of the CL&Aacute;R programme which will examine CL&Aacute;R areas by reference to the 2016 Census of Population data.  It will also consider whether there are any other factors that should be taken into account in designating areas for eligibility under CL&Aacute;R in the future.</p>  <p>  My officials have been in contact with NIRSA with regard to carrying out a detailed analysis of the most recent Census data to further inform the review process, and that engagement is ongoing.  I envisage that a wider stakeholder consultation will also take place before the review is fully complete.  Once completed, the review will help to inform the design of future CL&Aacute;R programmes and any additional measures which may be included.</p></reply>

In this regard, no single criterion can necessarily support a decision that a couple are separated or not.  The criteria for assessment include, but are not limited to: </p><p>- whether they share financially as a couple; </p><p>- whether the separation is temporary or long-term; </p><p>- whether there is an expectation of living together again shortly; </p><p>- whether the marriage or civil partnership remains unbroken.  </p><p>If the deciding officer considers the couple to be separated, then the earnings of the spouse or civil partner would not be included in the means assessment.  Any maintenance payments (including the payment of rent/mortgage) would then be assessable.</p><p>On several schemes there is a maintenance disregard in respect of housing costs. Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, One-Parent Family Payment, Disability Allowance, State Pension (Non-Contributory), Blind Pension, Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Non-Contributory) Pension and, as of Budget 2019, Working Family Payment all have a maintenance disregard in place. For these schemes, housing costs of up to &euro;95.23 per week are disregarded, and 50% of any maintenance above this is assessed as means.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy  <b>.</b></p></reply>

Nevertheless, in order to target SSF funding interventions, in October 2018, local authorities were invited to undertake an economic assessment of their sites to assess whether the provision of affordable homes was necessary and economically viable.  As part of that assessment local authorities were also asked to consider the broader housing affordability within their area.  19 local authorities returned economic assessments to my Department.</p><p>To date, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will see the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes.  I anticipate that a further Call for Proposals under the SSF will issue to local authorities in 2020. Full details of the projects approved under the 1st and 2nd SSF calls can be found at the following links: </p><p>Homes delivered under the SSF are subject to the provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which was commenced in June 2018.  This legislation now provides the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State. Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  </p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters. When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.</p><p>In addition to SSF, funding of &euro;200m has also been made available under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which is also designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development could take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand.  30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities funding the balance.  These projects will stimulate development of approximately 20,000 housing units across 14 local authorities and approximately 7,800 of these homes will be offered at a discount on open market prices.</p><p>These schemes will complement other key Government affordability initiatives, such as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have supported over 15,000 households nationally.</p></reply>

The State has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters. It is not possible for the State to take on responsibility/liability for all legacy issues nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance.</p>  <p>  My focus will remain firmly on ensuring the full roll out of the Building Control reform agenda, to ensure that all those that engaged in the construction sector take their responsibilities seriously and are appropriately held to account.</p></reply>

This radar network provides real-time rainfall information for Ireland.</p><p>The radar at Shannon Airport has had high availability for 2018 and much of 2019, with only short outages, generally for routine maintenance and scheduled during dry weather. However, there have been two more significant outages recently due to technical faults, from 1 to 14 August 2019 and 25 October to 21 November 2019. The generally high levels of availability of the Shannon radar are reflected in the table, which sets out the percentage of time it was operational during each of the months from January 2018 to October 2019. </p><p>Met &Eacute;ireann works closely with the manufacturers of the Shannon radar to schedule preventative maintenance and rectify technical issues when they arise. Most recently, in January 2019, at the request of Met &Eacute;ireann, a review of the Shannon radar was carried out by the radar manufacturer. Following this review, a schedule of identified maintenance tasks was carried out to reduce the risk of technical faults. </p><p>Met &Eacute;ireann has commenced a procurement process for a replacement weather radar system for Shannon Airport. Additionally Met &Eacute;ireann has, since 2018, Met Eireann has been actively planning a broader project to upgrade, modernise and expand the Irish weather radar network. A scoping exercise is currently underway to identify the key requirements for a five radar network. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Shannon Radar Availability 2018</th>       <th>Shannon Radar Availability 2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January</td>       <td>98.9%</td>       <td>96.5%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>February</td>       <td>97.3%</td>       <td>99.6%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March</td>       <td>99.6%</td>       <td>99.8%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April</td>       <td>99.9%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May</td>       <td>98.8%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June</td>       <td>99.9%</td>       <td>98.7%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July</td>       <td>99.8%</td>       <td>98.2%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August</td>       <td>93.7%</td>       <td>57.7%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>September</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>99.6%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>October</td>       <td>99.3%</td>       <td>77%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>-</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>-</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

My Department is not involved in the selection of the properties to be retrofitted, nor the sequence in which the works are prioritised by the local authority.</p></reply>
