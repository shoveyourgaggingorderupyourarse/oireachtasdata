This includes supporting the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, to develop, produce and equitably distribute effective technologies in the COVID-19 global response.</p>  <p>  The lead responsibility for both Intellectual Property and Trade lies with my Department. My officials maintain contact with other Departments, including the Department for Foreign Affairs, on this matter, as appropriate.</p></reply>

We recognised that while thousands of businesses were benefitting from our schemes, there were a small number operating from non-rated business and home offices that had fixed costs and that were viable and could be positioned to reopen. That is why I worked with officials in my Department and with Government colleagues to develop the SBASC grants. </p><p>The total number of Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) applications for County Kilkenny is 237, of which 117 have been approved for payment. </p><p>Refusals have occurred due to eligibility requirements such as businesses not meeting the turnover criteria that turnover had decreased by 75% during the eligibility period, incomplete application forms or the business was in receipt of CRSS or another sectoral scheme.</p><p>The Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) is now closed and eligible business can now apply for the Government's new Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS). My Government colleague, the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe TD on 6<sup>th</sup>September last announced the launch of the BRSS as a new support scheme for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions, with a maximum payment of &euro;15,000. The BRSS is a general scheme and is open to any businesses whose turnover remains impacted as a result of public health restrictions. Businesses who previously availed of other schemes such and SBASC, the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme and CRSS will be eligible to apply provided they meet the qualifying criteria.</p><p>Details of the wide range of COVID-19 schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>I would also encourage business owners to talk to Kilkenny's Local Enterprises Office, which offers advice and guidance in relation to the supports available to businesses.</p></reply>

I also met with a number of IDA Ireland existing and target client companies during the mission from the financial, telecommunications, insurance and e-commerce sectors.</p>  <p>  One thing that struck me during the mission was the extent of regional investment in Ireland from the companies I met - from Waterford, to Shannon, to Tuam and Athlone.</p>  <p>  While in Paris, I met with the French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire and we discussed a broad range of issues including French Presidency planning for Trade and COMPET council, Brexit and Digital issues.  </p>  <p>  And in London, I took the opportunity to meet with senior Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to discuss a range of issues of mutual interest, including Brexit and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  I emphasised the position that the Irish Government has consistently taken on the Protocol which is that it is the agreed solution between the UK and the EU to the problems caused by Brexit for the island of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  While acknowledging that there are clearly issues impacting trade in Northern Ireland that need to be addressed, I indicated the Irish Government view that solutions do exist, within the parameters of the Protocol, for many of the trading difficulties that businesses in Northern Ireland have been experiencing. </p>  <p>  I referred to the EU&rsquo;s consistent willingness to respond positively to the concerns of the people in Northern Ireland in terms for instance of the extension in June 2021 of grace periods under the Protocol. The continued priority by the EU to the Protocol is also clear from the 2-day visit by Commissioner Maros Sefcovic to Northern Ireland last week to work closely with the political, business and civic leaders in a solution focussed manner. </p>  <p>  I encouraged the UK Government in return, to work in partnership with the EU in a spirit of positive and constructive engagement in order to identify pragmatic and sustainable solutions to the outstanding issues around the implementation of the Protocol. However, the Protocol cannot be renegotiated. </p>  <p>  Just prior to my visit to the UK, I visited Northern Ireland and met with business representatives and heard at first-hand the opportunities they see, including on an all-island and cross border basis, and on the types of issues and challenges they are dealing with. </p>  <p>  Ministerial-led trade missions support the Government&rsquo;s major drive towards market diversification and export growth. As the Covid-19 situation improves and international travel returns I look forward to supporting the work of our agencies on future trade and investment missions.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-15a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021091500071#WRB01800"><p>The right to request remote work is part of a broader Government vision to make remote working a permanent feature of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce in a way that can benefit all &ndash; economically, socially and environmentally.  The commitment to introduce legislation to underpin employees' right to request remote work was made in the national Remote Work Strategy published last January.  The Covid pandemic has certainly brought remote working centre stage and work on this important legislation is well advanced.</p>  <p>  The Bill will set out a clear framework to facilitate remote and blended work options, in so far as possible. It will ensure that when an employer declines a request, there are stated reasons for doing so. Remote working won&rsquo;t work for everyone, so we will take a balanced approach with the legislation.</p>  <p>  On 20th August, I published the views from members of the public and stakeholder groups on the new legislation. The summary report of the 175 submissions is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  Informed by the public consultation and a review of international best practice, the drafting of the General Scheme of the Bill has commenced and I will be seeking Cabinet approval for the drafting of Heads of a Bill in Quarter 4 of 2021. The Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible thereafter. The intention is to introduce a mechanism for employees to request remote working that is fair but does not place an undue burden on employers.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, we will also continue to provide up to date advice, guidance and information on all aspects of remote working for workers and employers.</p>  <p>On 28th   June I launched my department&rsquo;s Making Remote Work campaign. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the advice and information available from Government to help workers and employers facilitate more remote and blended working. This includes guidance for employers and workers and a Remote Working Checklist which are all available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This includes supporting the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, to develop, produce and equitably distribute effective technologies in the COVID-19 global response.</p></reply>

The Local Authorities are important partners in achieving that policy objective. </p>  <p>  To ensure we are delivering on the potential of each region, my Department is currently overseeing the development of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024. Myself and Minister Robert Troy are overseeing the development of these Plans nationally. These are bottom-up plans, developed by regional stakeholders including the Local Authorities, along with the enterprise agencies, local enterprise offices, education and training institutes, and others in each region.</p>  <p>  The Plans aim to identify growth opportunities, recognise vulnerabilities, and in response, strengthen the regional enterprise ecosystem to enable job creation in the regions. This includes the development of digital, enterprise / co-working hubs in the regions.</p>  <p>  Under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), the Border Enterprise Development Fund (BEDF), the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme, the Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme, the Campus Incubation Programme, and the Regional Accelerator Scheme, my Department through Enterprise Ireland has invested over &euro;200 million in digital and enterprise centre infrastructures.  These facilities provide affordable, digitally connected, physical workspace across the country, deliver training and soft assistance to their tenants and other companies in their locality and regional area, and offer co-working facilities. </p>  <p>  The total number of projects part funded by Local Authorities in both the RDEF and BEDF calls (4 in total) is 38 out of a total 79 projects funded.</p>  <p>  The Community Enterprise Centres have primarily been funded by Enterprise Ireland up to a level of 50% with the previous County Enterprise Boards providing up to 22.5%. In many Instances, there was additional funding provided by the Local Authority by way of cash or the provision of a suitable site for the building.</p>  <p>  I chair a National Steering Committee for the development of a Quality Standards System and Framework for Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise hub sector, a project being managed and co-ordinated by the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres, and which received funding from my Department under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund. The initiative, whose Steering Committee includes representation from the City and County Managers Association, will help strengthen Ireland's position as a world class destination in terms of remote working, startup ecosystem, community enterprise development, and innovation. </p>  <p>  On the 29 July 2021, my Department announced a new &euro;10 million Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme (RETS) administered by Enterprise Ireland to assist with the expansion of existing enterprise development projects under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund and Border Enterprise Development Fund. These funds will improve the capability and competitiveness of regional enterprises in the wake of Covid-19 and Brexit and those seeing to transition in the context of climate action and digitisation.   </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that the RETS also includes &euro;500,000 in Feasibility Study funding to assist early-stage regional enterprise development projects which may include proposed enterprise/incubation centres. Local Authorities as project partners may apply for this funding.</p></reply>

This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high-profile disputes.  It would be inappropriate for me to intervene or engage in industrial relations disputes including the dispute mentioned by the Deputy in this question.<br /><br />I would like to emphasise the need for workers and employers to make every effort to reach a resolution. The dispute handling mechanisms of the State are of course willing, where possible, to assist the parties in coming to a resolution. This will ensure a positive outcome for the employees, the company and the customers of the company </blockquote></reply>

The Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, under the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery &amp;amp; Investment, which the T&aacute;naiste chairs was established to oversee and drive forward insurance reform.  The Action Plan for Insurance Reform is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake. Implementation of the Plan is on track with the first six-monthly Implementation Report published in July 2021, showing that work is progressing well to implement the Action Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions completed.</p><p>Actions for my own Department under the Action Plan are set out as follows:</p><p>- Enhancing the role of thePersonal Injuries Assessment Board </p><p>As Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, I have met regularly with PIAB and a range of representative bodies to assess the role of PIAB and develop proposals to enhance and reform the agency. I have undertaken a public consultation seeking views on the matter from all interested parties. The Department has considered the 240 responses received and, informed by the public consultation, Heads of a Bill have been developed in consultation with PIAB, which I am considering.</p><p>As set out in the Plan the new Personal Injuries Guidelines came into effect on the 24th April. These Guidelines apply to all cases assessed by PIAB from that date. Preliminary PIAB data indicates that since the implementation of the Guidelines, the average PIAB award has decreased by approximately 50%. Furthermore, about 80% of PIAB awards are now &euro;15,000 or less, compared to 30% in 2020. The new Guidelines clearly represent a shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded in our country and in the level of those damages and should exert downward pressure on insurance premiums.  </p><p>In addition, the Minister for Justice and I, published the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Bill 2021 in April 2021. This Bill will bring Garda compensation claims within the PIAB process. This will benefit both claimants, in terms of quicker resolution of claims with an objective assessment of quantum, and the State as the respondent, in terms of lower legal and administrative costs.</p><p>- Strengthening theenforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission(CCPC)</p><p>On the 22<sup>nd</sup>December 2020 Government approved the General Scheme of the Competition (Amendment) Bill. This Bill represents a step change in competition enforcement for Ireland and will give the CCPC more effective enforcement powers to punish anti-competitive conduct. The Bill has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is currently undergoing drafting with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  <b></b></p><p>- Working together with theDepartment of Finance to establish an office within government toencourage greater competition in the insurance market</p><p>An Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has been established within the Department of Finance, chaired by Minister of State Fleming and supported by my Department. The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. It is also involved in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. This Office provides a more coordinated Government policy approach to increase competition in the insurance sector.</p><p>The full implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform will help to ensure that we have an insurance system which is both affordable and reliable and underpins a vibrant economy. </p></reply>

This includes supporting the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, to develop, produce and equitably distribute effective technologies in the COVID-19 global response.</p></reply>

In response to this, Government introduced measures to assist impacted business. With the assistance of these measures, in 2020, a large number of Covid-19 impacted companies were sustained.</p>  <p>  Now, as we cautiously emerge from these necessary public health restrictions and global markets begin to open up again, the Government will continue to help businesses in their next phase of recovery and adaptation.</p>  <p>  In August 2021, the T&aacute;naiste announced the launch of &euro;51 million in funding, under the new Sustaining Enterprise and Accelerated Recovery Fund. This fund has two objectives, the first is to sustain enterprise through the provision of liquidity measures thereby assisting companies whose end markets continue to be impacted by Covid-19 restrictions. This offer is an extension of the Sustaining Enterprise Fund or SEF which was administered by our Agency, Enterprise Ireland (EI), on behalf of Government in 2020 and during the first half of 2021 and reflects the recovery needs of business as public health restrictions are lifted and business reopens. Under the SEF, &euro;188 million was approved to 700 companies helping maintain over 28,850 jobs. </p>  <p>  The second objective of the fund is to assist companies to make an Accelerated Recovery plan which embraces both digital and climate change transformation which is in line with Government policy and essential for the economic activity of companies after the impact of Covid-19. This also encompasses  a Digitalisation Voucher to assist the development of a digitalisation plan.</p>  <p>  Full details of the fund and eligibility can be found on the Enterprise Ireland website: www.enterprise-ireland.com/recover.</p>  <p>  My Department working with Enterprise Ireland are currently promoting this new offer and is working with companies on funding applications. </p></reply>

To deliver on insurance reform Government established a Cabinet Committee Subgroup on insurance reform which is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and of which I am a member. The subgroup published the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in December 2020 which sets out actions across Government that will be taken to reform the insurance market. This is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake. Implementation of the Plan is on track with the first six-monthly Implementation Report published in July 2021, showing that work is progressing well to implement the Action Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions completed.</p>  <p>  Among the actions completed are the introduction of the Personal Injuries Guidelines which came into effect on the 24th April. These Guidelines apply to all cases assessed by PIAB from that date. Preliminary PIAB data indicates that since the implementation of the Guidelines, the average PIAB award has decreased by approximately 50%. Furthermore, about 80% of PIAB awards are now &euro;15,000 or less, compared to 30% in 2020. The new Guidelines clearly represent a significant shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded in our country and in the level of those damages and should exert downward pressure on insurance costs.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 was signed into law in June 2021 and commenced on 28 July 2021.  The legislation provides a clear definition of perjury and should enable the offence and related offences to be more easily prosecuted in the courts. The establishment of the Insurance Fraud Coordination Office under the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau is also a welcome development. Both will act as effective deterrents to assist in tackling fraudulent claims.</p>  <p>  An Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has been established within the Department of Finance, chaired by Minister of State Fleming and supported by my Department. The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. It is also involved in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. This Office provides a coordinated Government policy approach to increasing competition in the insurance sector.</p>  <p>  As Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, I have met regularly with PIAB and a range of representative bodies to assess the role of PIAB and develop proposals to enhance and reform the agency. Heads of a Bill have been developed in consultation with PIAB, which I am considering. I am also progressing legislation to strengthen competition law in Ireland. The legislation will break new ground in this area, giving competition authorities, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), enhanced powers including administrative sanctions and other tools in dealing with anti-competitive practices.</p>  <p>  The scope of the National Claims Information Database has been widened to cover Employer Liability and Public Liability with a first report published by the Central Bank in July.</p>  <p>  While progress on these actions is welcome, Government is committed to doing more to reduce insurance costs. The Minister for Justice is considering legislative proposals to reform the law in the area of occupier&rsquo;s liability. Under the Action Plan, the Department of Justice is working on several actions in the area of fraud. We will also enhance the National Claims Information Database. Ministers and I have met regularly with stakeholders to understand the issues they face and to inform our policy making process. This engagement will continue as we deliver meaningful reform of the insurance sector.</p></reply>

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market. </p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market. </p>  <p>  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by the Department and of the relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The most recent review did not recommend removal of the occupation of care worker/home carers from the Ineligible Occupations List as the evidence suggests that other factors, such as the contracts of employment on offer and employment terms and conditions being offered are a factor in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage. The sector has also previously been advised that a more systematic and structured engagement with the Department of Social Protection needs to be demonstrated.</p>  <p>  If a sector wishes to propose a change to the occupations lists, they need to submit a detailed evidence-based business case to substantiate their request. </p>  <p>  A review is currently underway, with submissions received, including submissions from the Home Care sector, under consideration. It is expected that the review will be finalised by the end of September/early October.</p></reply>

This strategy is focused on three key objectives, to build awareness of social enterprises, to grow and strengthen social enterprises and to achieving better policy alignment across government.  </p>  <p>  Social enterprises operate right across society and the economy, addressing social, economic and environmental challenges. Many social enterprises interact with a wide range of government funding schemes and programmes, in areas such as labour market policy, rural and community development, childcare, health, social inclusion and environmental policy.</p>  <p>  In this respect, representatives of my Department and the agencies have engaged with their counterparts in the Department of Rural and Community Development. They have communicated their understanding that social enterprises that meet with the eligibility criteria of the grant aid schemes on offer through Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices would not be precluded from applying for these programmes. Furthermore, the Local Enterprise Offices offer a wide range of high-quality business and management development programmes to any small business, including those that would be considered social enterprises.

In response to this, Government introduced measures to assist impacted business. With the assistance of these measures, in 2020, a large number of Covid-19 impacted companies were sustained.</p>  <p>  Now, as we cautiously emerge from these necessary public health restrictions and global markets begin to open up again, the Government will  continue to help businesses in their next phase of recovery and adaptation.</p>  <p>  In August 2021, I  announced the launch of  &euro;51 million in funding, under the new Sustaining Enterprise and Accelerated Recovery Fund. This fund has two objectives, the first is to sustain enterprise through the provision of liquidity measures thereby assisting companies whose end markets continue to be impacted by Covid-19 restrictions. This offer is an extension of the Sustaining Enterprise Fund or SEF which was administered by our Agency, Enterprise Ireland (EI), on behalf of Government in 2020 and during the first half of 2021 and reflects the recovery needs of business as public health restrictions are lifted and business reopens. Under the SEF, &euro;188 million was approved to 700 companies helping maintain over 28,850 jobs. </p>  <p>  The second objective of the fund is to assist companies to make an Accelerated Recovery plan which embraces both digital and climate change transformation which is in line with Government policy and essential for the economic activity of companies after the impact of Covid -19. This is further aided by a Digitalisation Voucher to assist the development of a digitalisation plan.</p>  <p>  My Department working with Enterprise Ireland are currently promoting this new offer and is working with companies on funding applications. As this offer has only been live for one month, the application pipeline is just commencing. To date, there have been seven approvals totalling &euro;129,000 made to companies under this Fund. Six approvals are for Digitalisation Vouchers while one approval is for the Sustaining Enterprise Fund.</p></reply>

Ensuring we have the best business environment for all businesses to grow and proposer requires a whole of Government approach so we can underpin the longer-term resilience of our enterprise sector to deal with future shocks. That is why engagement and coordination with other Departments and agencies is so important to delivering on our indigenous enterprise development priorities, including through Cabinet Committees, Senior Officials Groups and other enterprise stakeholder groups and fora which I and my officials actively lead and are involved with.   </p>  <p>  A central focus for my Department and the Indigenous Enterprise Division over the last two years in particular is assisting businesses across all sectors to prepare for Brexit and to respond to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This included the development of business continuity checklists, toolkits, grants and awareness campaigns, online grant schemes, schemes for recruiting staff to deal with customs, a range of loan and finance schemes including the &euro;800m Future Growth Loan Scheme and the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme developed with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the design and delivery of the &euro;650m Restart Grant Scheme and top-ups in 2020 and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) this year. The Division also has liaison responsibility for Enterprise Ireland, the 31 Local Enterprise Offices and the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland and each of these agencies have implemented a range of new grant and advisory schemes to help indigenous businesses on behalf of the Department., which have helped thousands of indigenous businesses through the COVID-19 crisis.    </p>  <p>  A key priority in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future was the establishment of the SME Growth Taskforce, which I Chaired in the latter half of 2020 and was a follow-up on the recommendations in the 2019 OECD on SME and Entrepreneurship Policy commissioned by my Department. The Taskforce membership included entrepreneurs, business leaders, unions and other stakeholders to fulfil the commitment made in the Programme for Government to draw up a long-term strategic blueprint for SMEs and entrepreneurs beyond COVID-19. The research and work of the Taskforce included engagement with a range of government departments and agencies on the key development issues for indigenous enterprise. The resulting report 'SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan&rsquo;, sets out a wide range of recommendations with long-term strategic relevance for SMEs and entrepreneurs. The recommendations include measures to help SMEs and entrepreneurs to start up, scale up and access foreign markets, as well as recommendations aimed at helping SMEs to become more productive and ready for the transition to a digital, green economy. </p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Report, a Ministerial-led 'SME &amp;amp; Entrepreneurship Implementation Group' was formed to take forward these proposals in conjunction with appropriate Government Departments, Agencies and other stakeholders. To-date the Implementation Group, which is led by my colleagues Minister English and Minister Troy and the Indigenous Enterprise Division have met on five occasions and have held sessions to discuss progress on thematic areas such as insurance costs, access to finance, entrepreneurship and internationalisation, digitalisation, clustering and networking. The  Taskforce is meeting in plenary tomorrow to review progress on the recommendations and to consider any additional measures needed to help our indigenous sector as the economy reopens. </p>  <p>  In addition to the commitment to establish the SME and Entrepreneurship TaskForce, the Division also led on the commitment in the Programme for Government to establish a SME State Bodies Group, to consider access to finance issues for indigenous enterprise. I chair this Group, together with my Ministerial colleagues the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, T.D. and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath, T.D. The Group was a particularly helpful forum for assessing the financing needs of SMEs as the COVID-19 crisis unfolded and as the Indigenous Enterprise Division worked on the design of the COVID Credit Guarantee Scheme. To date over &euro;500m has been drawn down by over 7,000 indigenous businesses. Similarly, the Division worked with Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture on the development of the new &euro;330m Brexit Impact Loan Scheme, the enabling legislation for which was passed by the Oireachtas earlier this year.  In addition, for the agri-food sector, my officials in the Indigenous Enterprise Division have worked closely also with DAFM colleagues on the design and implementation of the &euro;75m Agri-Food Competitiveness and Market Diversification Fund I launched earlier this year to help impacted businesses in the sector respond to the twin challenges of COVID and Brexit. </p>  <p>  More generally, we are working to increase the range businesses eligible for assistance and the 31 Local Enterprise Offices have already started on this road with the Productivity Fund and Business Continuity Vouchers, which targeted an expanded cohort of enterprises that is firms with up to 50 employees which would customarily not have qualified for funding. Enterprise Ireland is also working with a broader base of non-exporting SMEs, with the Retail On-line scheme and the COVID-19 Sustaining Enterprise Fund and the Sustaining Enterprise and Accelerated Recovery Fund. We are also providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. We have also launched a number of new climate change advisory and grants schemes this year and I am pleased that the LEOs' Green for Micro scheme is progressing well. </p>  <p>  In response to the on-going issues arising from COVID-19, my Department continued to virtually engage with indigenous enterprise through the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEO). Many of the ongoing schemes and initiatives were moved to online platforms to allow for continued engagement with client companies. </p>  <p>  The Look for Local campaign launched earlier this summer by the LEOs, is funded by my Department and supported by Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Authorities.  The Look for Local campaign was an opportunity for the LEOs to show support for all those small businesses as they reopened and encouraged Irish consumers to do the same. </p>  <p>  My colleague Damien English T.D., Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail chairs the Retail Forum. The Retail Forum was established by my Department in June 2014 and provides a platform for structured engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers and the public sector on key concerns for the retail sector. The agenda is driven by Forum Members with key issues discussed at Forum level and also progressed through Working Groups.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Retail Forum, Minister of State English has engaged directly with the retail, grocery and distribution sector during the pandemic and Brexit. The Forum will meet later this week to consider the progress on a major review of the future of the retail sector and also progress on the Online Retail Scheme, for which over &euro;19m has been awarded to retail businesses to date.   </p>  <p>  in relation to the indigenous personal services sectors, Minister English, along with colleagues from the Indigenous Enterprise, SMEs and Entrepreneurship Division have formally held a number of meetings with representatives from the Hair and Beauty sector to discuss issues arising from COVID as well as other concerns and needs the sector has to become more resilient, sustainable and competitive in attracting and retaining employees and this engagement will continue.</p>  <p>  My Department is also in regular contact with these representatives to keep them informed on subjects such as education and training, while responding to any queries they may have, e.g. VAT rates, statutory sick pay, etc. As a result, my Department have engaged with colleagues from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection on a range of topics pertinent to that Sector.   </p>  <p>  Regional enterprise development and sustainable local job creation is a key policy priority of mine and this Government. My Department is overseeing the development of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024, including for each region. These are bottom-up plans, developed by regional stakeholders including the Local Authorities, the enterprise agencies, local enterprise offices, regional skills forum and education and training institutes in each region.</p>  <p>  The Plans aim to identify growth opportunities, recognise vulnerabilities, and in response, strengthen the regional enterprise ecosystem to enable job creation in the regions and are additional to the ongoing work of the various bodies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, and others focusing on collaborative initiatives aimed at job creation in the regions. </p>  <p>  Each Plan is overseen and monitored by a Regional Steering Committee made up of regional stakeholders and chaired by a senior level private sector businessperson. My Departmental colleagues, Minister Robert Troy and Minister Damien English are driving the delivery of the new Plans and chair a national oversight group which enables sharing of best practice and collaboration opportunities across the regions. </p>  <p>  In relation to the tourism and hospitality sectors, which are significant indigenous employers, I established and chair the Hospitality Forum with my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin T.D., who has lead policy responsibility and Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are agencies of her Department.  My Department and the Indigenous Enterprise Division continue to work closely with colleagues across government departments and agencies on measures and funding schemes to assist the hospitality, live events and exhibition sectors and most recently were central to the recent reopening of indoor hospitality in July.  </p>  <p>  While the last year has been challenging for indigenous enterprise, we have a strong and resilient base of businesses that we are committed to ensuring can sustain and grow their employment and sales into the future. I was pleased last week to lead the first in-person trade mission of indigenous enterprise since last March 2020 to the UK, France and Germany, to promote Irish innovation and secure additional contracts. I and my Department will continue to work with government departments and sectoral agencies as appropriate to ensure that we have the most conducive and competitive environment and to strengthen the close working with sectoral policy departments and sectoral agencies.    </p></reply>

This scheme is a successor to the Brexit Loan Scheme, which will close to new applications as the new scheme opens. </p>  <p>  The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme has been developed in cooperation between my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It will be operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and delivered through participating lenders. The scheme is supported by a guarantee through the European Guarantee Fund (EGF), which is being implemented by the European Investment Fund [EIF] on behalf of the European Commission.</p>  <p>  Loans under this scheme will range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m, and will be for longer terms than under its predecessor: up to six years. These loans will be offered at lower interest rates than other similar lending in the market, and loans of up to &euro;500,000 will be made available unsecured. These loans can be used for liquidity or investment purposes. </p>  <p>  The terms of the new scheme are comparable to those offered under the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, which has seen significant uptake since its launch in September 2020. To date, 6,592 loans have been provided by the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, to a total value of more than &euro;431 million.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Impact Loan Scheme is expected to open to new applications later this month. </p></reply>

The agencies under the remit of my Department have developed digitalisation programmes to assist businesses to not only commence trading online but also encourage those already trading online to further develop their e-commerce capability. </p><p>The Online Retail Scheme was used in response to the Covid-19 crisis and the continuing urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. The purpose of this fund is to enable Irish-owned retailers to enhance their digital capability and to develop a more competitive online offer that will enable an increase in their customer base and build a more resilient business in the domestic and global marketplace, both online and offline.</p><p>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme,<b></b>administered by the Local Enterprise Offices on behalf of my Department, offers a voucher of up to &euro;2,500 (50% co- funded by the applicant) to help businesses develop their online trading capability and includes training sessions that cover various topics, including developing a website, digital marketing, social media for business and search engine optimisation. </p><p>In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the opportunity to apply for a second voucher was introduced.  When this scheme transferred into my department in January this year, a decision was made to retain this provision as it was identified as a key tool in assisting Micro-Enterprises in further developing their E-commerce capability. </p><p>Furthermore, my Department, in conjunction with their colleagues in the Local Enterprise Office Centre of Excellence in Shannon, have commenced a process of evaluation of this scheme. The aim of this evaluation to determine, among other things, the impact of the scheme pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, how it might look in the future and what level of funding is required to deliver the scheme going forward.  This process is ongoing, and will help inform any future policy considerations arising therefrom. </p></reply>

The national context for IDA&rsquo;s approach to winning investment for the regions is set by Project Ireland 2040 and the associated National Planning Framework (NPF), National Development Plan and Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies. The IDA&rsquo;s Regions pillar also aligns with the objectives of the Programme for Government in relation to regional development. IDA intends to win investment for the main regional cities and the regional growth centres identified in the NPF.</p><p>Specifically, the IDA will target 40 investments for the Mid-East region in the period 2021 to 2024. In addition to Louth, the Mid-East includes the the counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow. </p><p>There are 97 IDA client companies in the Mid-East region, directly employing 18,396 people. Co. Louth is home to 30 IDA Ireland client companies directly employing more than 4,372 people and includes the regional growth centres of Drogheda and Dundalk. The FDI performance in the region has been consistent over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing by 6%.  </p><p>The timely provision of appropriate, cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of multinational companies remains essential to winning FDI. IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme ensures the continued supply of land, buildings and infrastructure in regional locations to meet the needs of current and prospective clients.  A robust property and infrastructure ecosystem can be the key differentiator in winning FDI projects.  </p><p>In June 2021, IDA Ireland acquired two landbanks in Co Louth.  These land acquisitions, with a combined total of 149 acres are situated in Dundalk and in Drogheda and form part of IDA&rsquo;s long term strategic plan to position Louth and the wider region to compete for FDI investment. The acquisition of these landbanks is part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s overall property programme. </p><p>Over the course of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, &quot;Driving Recovery &amp;amp; Sustainable Growth 2021-2024&quot;,<b></b>IDA will deliver 19 Advanced Building Solutions across the country, including in Drogheda and Dundalk. </p></reply>

Our Economic Recovery Plan outlines ongoing support for people and businesses to make a full return to work and sets out medium term policies to promote sustainable and balanced growth, as well as signalling the gradual phasing out of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  The overarching ambition in our Economic Recovery Plan is to have 2.5 million people in work by 2024, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.</p>  <p>  The past year has been a difficult year for most businesses, including those in the retail sector. As the largest private sector employer, the retail sector plays a critical role in contributing to the Irish economy and in providing for the needs of society.  It is vital that our retail sector continues to develop capability and remains competitive. </p>  <p>  The number of PUP recipients in the Wholesale and Retail Sector has been falling since outlets reopened.  The sector has seen PUP claimants fall to 22,434 currently, down from the sector&rsquo;s 2021 peak of 76,606 in February.</p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic the sector was facing challenges with upward cost pressures and the increasing impact of technology. COVID-19 has accelerated structural changes, particularly the shift to digital and online with ripple effects in local economies. My Department has provided specific funding through the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme and the Trading Online Vouchers Scheme to assist the retail sector to make this transition. </p>  <p>  I want the sector to continue to develop and to become one of our most innovative and resilient sectors, so that people can be confident about building a long-term career in retail.   My Department will continue to engage with the sector through the Retail Forum, currently chaired by my colleague Damien English, TD, Minister of State for Business and Employment.  The forum provides a platform for structured engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers, and the public sector, on key issues for the sector.</p>  <p>  Our Economic Recovery Plan also commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment. This will be achieved through a combination of upskilling and reskilling with substantially accelerated training and skills opportunities and increased activation capacity through Pathways to Work 2021-2025. The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which targets 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025, is another important mechanism to address skills shortages. Retail Ireland&rsquo;s Skillnet Apprenticeship in Retail Supervision and the National Hairdressing Apprenticeship are good examples of programmes providing job-ready qualified professionals. My colleagues, Simon Harris, TD, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and Niall Collins, TD, Minister of State for Skills and Further Education, recently announced a further extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021 which provides financial support for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship. </p>  <p>  We want people to feel safe and be safe as we work through the progressive reopening of our economy and the return to the workplace.  My Department, with the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Health and the HSE developed a Work Safely Protocol which provides a framework for all businesses to operate safely in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  As businesses continue to re-open in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s latest roadmap, they must do so in accordance with the public health advice and with the COVID-19 mitigation measures set out in the Protocol. The ultimate aim is to keep employers and employees in all sectors safe while also helping businesses to re-open and, more importantly, to remain open and productive. </p></reply>

The UK, France and Germany combined represent 39% of total Enterprise Ireland client exports in 2020, with over 2,300 Enterprise Ireland client companies exporting to these three markets.

The regime acts as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  By design, it is vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.</p>  <p>  Employment permits are issued on the basis of a job offer from an employer in the State, having identified an individual that holds the appropriate qualification and skills. Further to that, my Department examines a number of criteria when assessing an application for an employment permit including that there is an employer/employee relationship and that a contract of employment exists.  </p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit.  The occupations lists are subject to a twice-yearly evidenced based review process involving consideration of research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  The views and guidance of the Interdepartmental Group on Economic Migration Policy, chaired by this Department are an important part of the decision-making process.  Contextual factors such as COVID 19 and Brexit are also taken into account.</p>  <p>  A fundamental review of the economic migration policy that underpins the Irish employment permit system, undertaken in 2018 concluded that, while the current system provides a robust framework to supplement the skills and labour needs in the State, the current legislation imposes considerable inflexibility in its operation. The review involved an international bench-marking exercise, a public consultation process and was overseen by the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group. In order to increase the agility and responsiveness of the system, to modernise it and to ensure that it is capable of adapting to rapid changes in the needs of the labour market, the Review recommended that new legislation be initiated. The Employment Permits (Consolidation and Amendment) Bill is being drafted to address these issues.</p>  <p>  The current priority is to progress this new legislation and the Department is not developing any further policy in this area at this time. Any consideration of a system suggested by the Deputy would require an in depth analysis and review to assess the implications of such a system across a range of areas including the implications for enterprise, the impact on the domestic labour market, our obligations to the European Union, and broader immigration policies.   </p></reply>

It underlines the sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy, and it illustrates the potential which exists for this sector to grow even further.

Not only has the pandemic had a disruptive impact, but the uncertainty around the cross-border trading environment has caused difficulties for companies that operate on both sides of the border.</p>  <p>  The challenges that surround Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unique position also come with significant opportunities, however. While there is some unease around the Protocol, I believe it presents a unique economic opportunity for businesses and trade on our shared island.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month I had the opportunity to travel to Northern Ireland to meet with business representatives there. The meeting allowed a wide-ranging discussion of current economic issues and the priorities of businesses across the island, reflecting the priority the Irish Government attaches to supporting and developing the all-island economy. </p>  <p>  I also visited the InterTradeIreland offices in Newry and experienced first-hand the hard work and commitment of its staff. ITI is working to grow trade across the border and to support businesses in dealing with the joint impacts of Brexit and the pandemic. The body has seen a significant increase in demand for its services in recent years and its continued success underscores not just ITI&rsquo;s value, but also the value of both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland working together.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to have had the opportunity to open the Shared Island Dialogue event on the all-island economy on 2 June this year. The Dialogue explored opportunities to enhance the economy on the island in a post-Covid environment, with a focus on young entrepreneurs, innovation and social enterprise. It featured a wide-range of participants, including entrepreneurs from both North and South that shared their perspectives of operating their businesses cross-border.</p>  <p>  The Dialogue was part of the Government&rsquo;s Shared Island Initiative, which seeks to examine political, social, economic and cultural considerations for a shared future in which all traditions are mutually respected. Central to this is the Shared Island Fund, where the Government has committed &euro;500m in capital funding between now and 2025, ring-fenced for investment in North/South projects.</p>  <p>  We will continue to work with InterTradeIreland, the Shared Island unit and colleagues in the Northern Ireland administration to make the most of these unique opportunities that cross border cooperation presents. </p></reply>

Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by the Department and of the relevant policy Departments.</p>  <p>  The occupation of Dental Nurse is ineligible for an employment permit. In order to add or remove an occupation from the lists, evidence is sought demonstrating that recruitment difficulties are solely due to genuine shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  Sectors are also required to engage structurally with the public employment service of the Department of Social Protection. The review process invites stakeholders, through the public consultation, to provide data to substantiate claims of lack of skills or labour available in a detailed evidence-based business case.</p>  <p>  A submission was received in respect of this occupation to the review completed in October 2020, no change was recommended at that time as the available evidence did not indicate recruitment difficulties for the role. A review of the occupation lists is underway at present, no submission has been received in respect of the occupation of Dental Nurse. Another review will commence later this year, to which the sector can make a detailed business case to have the occupation removed from the ineligible occupation list. </p></reply>

There are now over 6,700 people employed across 64 multinational companies in Clare. Recent investments of scale have been in Technology, Med Tech, Pharma and Financial Services sector. Clare has seen announcements from companies like Beckman Coulter, Edwards Lifesciences, Extreme Networks, Jaguar Land Rover in recent years and in the last year investors such as Exida, MeiraGTx, IQEQ, and OLED Material Manufacturing PPG have announced investment in Clare.  </p><p>IDA Ireland actively engages with Clare County Council, Shannon Commercial Properties and other property owners and stakeholders on their development plans, and markets sites and property solutions across the Mid-West region through its extensive overseas network to both existing and new investors. The region is well positioned to continue to retain and attract new FDI investment and grow employment in existing companies and IDA Ireland will continue to collaborate with all stakeholders and parties in the region to achieve this objective under the Regional Enterprise Plan.</p><p>There are 143 IDA client companies in the Mid-West Region, employing 24,169 people. The FDI performance in the region has been consistent over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing by 29%. The Mid-West has a significant ecosystem of well-established companies across Technology, Life Sciences, International Financial Services and Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies sectors. </p><p>IDA Ireland is a member of the Regional Enterprise Plan Steering Committee for the Mid West Region and works closely with partners on the implementation of this Plan and continuing the strong spirit of collaboration and collective effort that is essential to delivering on the ambition for the Mid West Region. </p><p>In 2020, Enterprise Ireland companies employed 4,372 people in 140 plants in Co. Clare. Payments to Enterprise Ireland companies in Co. Clare in 2018 - 2020 were &euro;8,765,263. This funding assists companies to innovate, be competitive and grow exports.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional team are working with companies in Co. Clare in a number of areas, including the Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme and REDF funded projects. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland launched the Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme to provide assistance, including funding supports, to regionally based not-for-profit undertakings that provide economic support to enterprises in sectors and regions negatively affected by Covid-19, as well as a consequence of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU (Brexit). This Scheme aims to offer a targeted solution to both existing and new Regional and Community-based projects that can demonstrate the ability to deliver impact and execute project deliverables in the current year. These not-for-profit projects should aim to improve the capability and competitiveness of regional enterprises and encourage entrepreneurial activity, productivity, and innovative capability in that regard. The Regional Team in the Mid West are closely working with applications in Clare and the Mid West Region, which closed out on 8th September 2021.</p><p>The Mid West team are currently working with REDF funded projects in County Clare such as the Clare Mez DAC, Future Mobility Campus Ireland and Emerald Aerocluster Company to attract SMEs to the county of Clare in their specialised sectors.  </p><p>The Mid West Regional team at Enterprise Ireland are consistent in dealing with prospective SME clients of Enterprise Ireland on a one to one and ongoing basis in Co Clare.

Climate change and its impacts present a significant threat to all of us and decarbonising our economy while promoting sustainable growth is one of the core objectives of this Government. </p>  <p>  Decarbonisation, the transition to a low carbon economy and associated behavioural changes will significantly alter the economy. The scale and nature of the challenge to meet Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious greenhouse gas emissions targets and lay the foundations for achieving a carbon neutral society by 2050 is profound. Embracing this transition will open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and create new jobs. The government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan will be a key instrument in doing this. It will encourage job creation and a recovery that promotes sustainable and balanced growth, while not forgetting pre-existing challenges, many of which have been exacerbated as a result of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) has conducted a study on the Skills to Enable the Low Carbon Economy to 2030. This study focussed on skills required to support the delivery of major elements of the 2019 Climate Action Plan. The work of the EGFSN is critical to informing the Government&rsquo;s approach to skills planning across the education and training system. The findings and recommendations of the report, due to be published in Q4, will assist our climate action and job creation efforts in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Under its new strategy for the period 2021-2024, the IDA will assist their clients to develop Corporate Climate Action Plans and to win sustainability investments, while Enterprise Ireland has launched the new Climate Action Enterprise Fund, to support client companies in the low-carbon transition.</p>  <p>  This Government recognises that enterprises that make the move early to reduce their carbon emissions will be more resilient to the market and regulatory changes that will deliver this transition to low carbon, and that there are significant opportunities for both existing and new firms to provide the goods and services that will be needed to decarbonise our economy. Through the investments to be set out in the revised NDP, and measures in the Government's forthcoming Climate Action Plan, to be published in the coming weeks, we will continue to enable enterprises to make greener choices and promote sustainable job growth that will address the climate challenge.</p></reply>

Published on January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2021, the Strategy aims to ensure that remote work is a permanent feature in the Irish workplace in a way which maximises its economic, social and environmental benefits. The Strategy reflects the Government&rsquo;s confidence that remote working can drive regional job creation and help secure more balanced regional development, and the Strategy shares many of its goals and actions with the Governments plan for rural Ireland launched in March, <i>Our Rural Future</i>. </p><p>Each action in the National Remote Work Strategy has been attributed to lead actors for delivery and each action is scheduled to be delivered by the end of this year. Lead actors report progress on the actions to the Interdepartmental Group (IDG) on Remote Work, of which Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are members. This IDG has met three times  this year, most recently on September 7<sup>th</sup>. At these meetings it has been established that good progress is underway to achieving the actions by their deadlines. The IDG will meet again in November to further drive the implementation of the Strategy. </p><p>The provision of remote working infrastructure to all parts of the country is crucial to successfully promoting remote work to business and workers. On May 31<sup>st</sup>, the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Western Development Commission launched Ireland&rsquo;s first National Hub Network, <i>ConnectedHubs.ie</i>. This was followed on July 22<sup>nd</sup>with the announcement of &euro;8.8 million in funding for 117 projects across Ireland as part of the Connected Hubs Call. This investment will contribute to the ongoing development of the National Hub Network, which already includes 134 hubs and will grow on a phased basis to over 400 hubs throughout the country. The ConnectedHubs.ie  platform is being widely marketed. This investment will bring significant employment opportunities to our regions and rural communities. </p><p>The ConnectedHubs.ie platform also includes the growing Gteic innovation and digital hub network being developed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to serve our Gaeltacht communities. Promoting the use of the Gteic network for remote working by people and businesses in the Gaeltacht forms an important part of  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2021-2025.</p><p>My Department is currently developing new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024. There will be a focus on promoting remote working opportunities and investing in infrastructures in each of the nine regions. My Department also recently announced &euro;10 million in funding for a new Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme. This scheme is administered by Enterprise Ireland and also includes a &euro;500,000 Feasibility Study to assist enterprise development projects, including the development of remote working and enterprise infrastructure.</p><p>Agencies under the auspices of my Department are actively promoting and facilitating remote work to their client companies and beyond. IDA Ireland is engaging with its client base to share knowledge on the implementation of remote and hybrid working arrangements.  These working models being promoted with international investors as part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s balanced regional development agenda. A particular emphasis is being placed on the potential of remote work to attract and retain talent. IDA Ireland supported the ConnectedHubs.ie launch through its communication channels and social media, and the ConnectedHubs map has been incorporated into IDA&rsquo;s property marketing content. A number of recent regional jobs announcements have referenced roles being open on a remote working basis. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland has developed a new employer guide to assist companies in preparing for the future of work in the post-Covid environment, with a focus on transitioning to remote, hybrid and flexible working cultures. EI has been widely promoting the guide to client companies and beyond. The guide was launched at a webinar hosted on 22<sup>nd</sup>June attended by over 200 business people. EI is also supporting The National Association of Community Enterprise Centres to promote greater use of their associate hubs to assist with the training of hub managers and teams. EI is additionally a member of the Grow Remote Advisory Panel and represents the needs of Irish indigenous industry in the move to hybrid ways of working. </p><p>On June 28th, my Department launched the &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo; campaign across broadcast, print and social media to promote the Guidance for Working Remotely webpage. This webpage acts as a central access point for employers and employees and brings together the existing State guidance, legislation and advice on remote work into one place. The webpage includes an Employer Checklist to provide employers with a quick way to successfully navigate the adoption of remote working arrangements. The &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo; campaign is continuing, and the Government is encouraging workers and employers to discuss the kinds of remote working arrangements that may be suitable for their organisations.</p><p>I am confident that these initiatives can promote the adoption of remote working arrangements by businesses and workers which will be a major driver of regional job creation.</p></reply>

In April, the Workplace Relations Commission published the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect which will help employees to strike a better work-life balance and to switch off from work outside of normal working hours.

Data centres are already a significant feature of Ireland&rsquo;s technology sector and our electricity demand (representing 11% of demand in 2020); they are also a core infrastructure enabler of a technology-rich, innovative economy, which makes Ireland a location of choice for a broad range of sectors and value-added activities. </p>  <p>  The Government is currently preparing a new Climate Action Plan that will address, amongst many objectives, our ambition to further decarbonise our electricity system. We will seek to further decarbonise our electricity grid while we simultaneously pursue the electrification of sectors such as transport and heating and, crucially, preserve our security of supply and the reliability of our grid. Arising from the Climate Action Plan, I expect that the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Enterprise Strategy&rsquo; will need to be revised to reflect new policy and regulatory developments, ongoing challenges and potential opportunities facing the sector. </p>  <p>  This would be part of a suite of actions to ensure that Ireland is planning appropriately for new energy demand in the context of our electrification and decarbonisation ambitions, facilitating growth in digitalisation and our technology sector, while ensuring that we are cultivating energy markets and infrastructure that deliver smart and competitively priced services to all electricity customers. Promoting a higher level of Corporate Power Purchase Agreements in the Irish market, assessing opportunities for large energy users to provide flexible levels of demand at peak times, and facilitating businesses to better monitor and manage the carbon intensity of their electricity hour by hour and across different locations on the grid, could all potentially contribute to this objective.  </p>  <p>  In revising the Government Statement, my Department would work closely with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and stakeholders such as Eirgrid, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and IDA Ireland, to set out the additional measures required to ensure that the existing demand for data centre development can be harnessed to drive the decarbonisation of our electricity system and deliver regional economic opportunities. I expect that appropriate grid connection policy and electricity market design, alongside research, development and innovation in the sector, can facilitate increasingly efficient, flexible and future-proofed infrastructure for Ireland&rsquo;s digital, knowledge-based economy. </p></reply>

At the same time, we must remember that commercial landlords have their own financial obligations that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank/lender will accept. One person&rsquo;s rent might be another person&rsquo;s income or pension.</p>  <p>  Over the last eighteen months, the Government has urged commercial landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. As such, last October, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents. The aim of this Code is to facilitate discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. It sets out a structured approach for engagement between both commercial landlords and tenants, based on their mutual interest in continuing to work together.</p>  <p>  The Code states that landlords should be willing to do what they can to help their tenants to continue to operate rather than facing the risk of a vacant premises and inability to obtain new tenants. Equally, tenants should pay what they can and speak with their landlord when difficulties arise. In addition, as set out in the Code, care should be taken to ensure that any repayment of the deferred rent does not compromise the ability of the affected tenant to recover from the crisis.</p>  <p>  As the relationship between landlord and tenant is a legal matter, the Code advises that parties may wish to seek legal advice when deciding new arrangements. If one party feels that another is reneging on new arrangements or new contractual commitments, they may also wish to seek legal advice in that instance.</p>  <p>  However, the Code should not be seen in isolation. The Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses through the crisis including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), the forthcoming Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. Many of these alone, or in combination, can be used to assist in the payment of commercial rents if needed.</p></reply>

While there will be some additional costs, the scheme is not intended to impose excessive costs on employers. Taking account of the current economic climate the initial period covered by employers will be modest, but this will increase incrementally. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, the legislation will provide for a replacement rate of 70% of gross salary for a duration of 3 working days in a calendar year.  Coupled with the 70% rate of pay, the application of a daily earnings cut-off point of &euro;110 will ensure that employers do not face excessive costs and that jobs are jeopardised.</p>  <p>  The Bill is intended to provide a minimum level of protection to low paid employees, who may have no company sick pay schemes and have 3 &lsquo;waiting days&rsquo; before eligibility for illness benefit from the State.</p>  <p>  As a first step, we want to plug the existing gap in coverage which would address the issue of people going to work while sick because of concerns about affordability. By closing the gap between illness benefit and waiting days we would eliminate this issue. </p>  <p>  The legislation will not prevent employers offering better sick pay terms or unions negotiating for more through a collective agreement.</p></reply>

This approach uses multiple layers and disparate systems to deliver security which is not dependent on any single component.  Given the heightened level of risk which has pertained in recent months, my Department&rsquo;s technical staff has adopted a posture of increased vigilance and oversight of systems. </p>  <p>  My Department takes advice from its own external security advisers, and monitors advice and guidance coming from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on any additional steps which should be implemented in the light of current risks.  State agencies under the remit of my Department also have access to advice and guidance from the NCSC and evaluate this advice in the context of their own cyber security arrangements.  </p>  <p>  On foot of increased threat levels from cyber criminals and the advice from the NCSC, my Department has implemented a number of additional controls, and has also reviewed existing controls to ensure that they are still being applied consistently. </p>  <p>  An independent review of my Department&rsquo;s cyber security controls was carried out in 2019.  The review was based on the ISO 27001 standard for good practice in an information security management system.  Overall, the review found that the Department&rsquo;s security posture was rated as good and above the standard which is usually seen in its sector.  The review has also been used as the basis for an ongoing programme of further improvements to information security standards.  Given the current threat levels and the significant resources which cyber criminals are prepared to use to hack into systems, it is important that we are not complacent in our approach to cyber security.  Cyber security is an ongoing process in my Department, and we will continue to review the controls we have in place and implement new controls and protections where necessary and as new cyber defence technologies become available.</p>  <p>  For operational and security reasons, we are advised by the NCSC not to disclose details of systems and processes which could in any way compromise cyber security measures in place in public bodies. In particular, it is not considered appropriate to disclose information which might assist criminals to identify potential vulnerabilities in departmental cybersecurity arrangements. </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not considered appropriate to disclose particular arrangements in place in relation to cyber security tools and services, and my Department does not comment on operational security matters.</p></reply>

This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high-profile disputes.

The Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group, under the auspices of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, was established in 2019 to coordinate relevant bodies to agree and implement a work programme addressing labour supply and skills requirements in the tourism and hospitality sector.   </p>  <p>  The State operates a managed employment permits system maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market. The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market. </p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by the Department and of the relevant policy Departments.</p>  <p>  A review is currently underway with submissions received, including submissions from the Hospitality sector, under consideration.

To deliver on insurance reform Government established a Cabinet Committee Subgroup on insurance reform which the T&aacute;naiste chairs. The subgroup published the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in December 2020 which sets out actions across Government that will be taken to reform the insurance market. This is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake. Implementation of the Plan is on track with the first six-monthly Implementation Report published in July 2021, showing that work is progressing well to implement the Action Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions completed.</p>  <p>  Among the actions completed are the introduction of the Personal Injuries Guidelines which came into effect on the 24th April. These Guidelines apply to all cases assessed by PIAB from that date. Preliminary PIAB data indicates that since the implementation of the Guidelines, the average PIAB award has decreased by approximately 50%. Furthermore, about 80% of PIAB awards are now &euro;15,000 or less, compared to 30% in 2020. The new Guidelines clearly represent a significant shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded in our country and in the level of those damages and should exert downward pressure on insurance costs.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 was signed into law in June 2021 and commenced on 28 July 2021.  The legislation provides a clear definition of perjury and should enable the offence and related offences to be more easily prosecuted in the courts. The establishment of the Insurance Fraud Coordination Office under the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau is also a welcome development. Both will act as effective deterrents to assist in tackling fraudulent claims.</p>  <p>  An Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has been established within the Department of Finance, chaired by Minister of State Fleming and supported by my Department. The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. It is also involved in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. This Office provides a coordinated Government policy approach to increasing competition in the insurance sector.</p>  <p>  As, Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, I have met regularly with PIAB and a range of representative bodies to assess the role of PIAB and develop proposals to enhance and reform the agency. Heads of a Bill have been developed in consultation with PIAB, which I am considering. I am also progressing legislation to strengthen competition law in Ireland. The legislation will break new ground in this area, giving competition authorities, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), enhanced powers including administrative sanctions and other tools in dealing with anti-competitive practices.</p>  <p>  The scope of the National Claims Information Database has been widened to cover Employer Liability and Public Liability with a first report published by the Central Bank in July.</p>  <p>  While progress on these actions is welcome, Government is committed to doing more to reduce insurance costs. The Minister for Justice is considering legislative proposals to reform the law in the area of occupier&rsquo;s liability. Under the Action Plan, the Department of Justice is working on several actions in the area of fraud. We will also enhance the National Claims Information Database. Ministers and I have met regularly with stakeholders to understand the issues they face and to inform our policy making process. This engagement will continue as we deliver meaningful reform of the insurance sector.</p></reply>

In response to this, Government introduced measures to assist impacted business. With the assistance of these measures, in 2020, a large number of Covid-19 impacted companies were sustained.</p>  <p>  Now, as we cautiously emerge from these necessary public health restrictions and global markets begin to open up again, the Government will  continue to help businesses in their next phase of recovery and adaptation.</p>  <p>  In August 2021, I  announced the launch of  &euro;51 million in funding, under the new Sustaining Enterprise and Accelerated Recovery Fund. This fund has two objectives, the first is to sustain enterprise through the provision of liquidity measures thereby assisting companies whose end markets continue to be impacted by Covid-19 restrictions. This offer is an extension of the Sustaining Enterprise Fund or SEF which was administered by our Agency, Enterprise Ireland (EI), on behalf of Government in 2020 and during the first half of 2021 and reflects the recovery needs of business as public health restrictions are lifted and business reopens. Under the SEF, &euro;188 million was approved to 700 companies helping maintain over 28,850 jobs. </p>  <p>  The second objective of the fund is to assist companies to make an Accelerated Recovery plan which embraces both digital and climate change transformation which is in line with Government policy and essential for the economic activity of companies after the impact of Covid -19. This is further aided by a Digitalisation Voucher to assist the development of a digitalisation plan.</p>  <p>  My Department, working with Enterprise Ireland, is currently promoting this new offer and is working with companies on funding applications. As this offer has only been live for one month, the application pipeline is just commencing. To date, there have been seven approvals totaling &euro;129,000 made to companies under this Fund. Six approvals are for Digitalisation Vouchers while one approval is for the Sustaining Enterprise Fund.</p></reply>

The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupation lists.  These lists are subject to twice yearly evidence-based review, taking account of labour market research, a public consultation and contextual issues such as Brexit and Covid 19.</p>  <p>  Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment.  Feedback received from enterprise across the board has been universally positive.  In fact, Ireland was one of the few countries that has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis. </p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.  </p>  <p>  My Department has seen a significant increase in applications for employment permits this year.  To the end of August, some 14,624 applications were received, representing a 35% increase over the same period in 2020 (10,772) and a 19% increase on 2019 (12,276).  Some 9,526 employment permits were issued over this period.  </p>  <p>  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications.  </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that when set against other international employment permit regimes, Ireland continues to compare extremely favourably, even at current processing times.  However, my Department is very conscious of the recent lengthening of timeframes for processing Employment Permit applications and is committed to reducing these further.  </p>  <p>  My Department is taking a range of measures to reduce the current backlog as quickly as possible and is confident that they will bear fruit over the coming weeks and months.  It advises employers to take current timelines into account as part of their recruitment plans.</p>  <p>  My Department updates the employment permit processing timelines on its website on a weekly basis and regularly issues updates on relevant employment permit matters to Trusted Partners such as the update on employment permit processing timelines.</p></reply>

An employee can refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission in the event of a dispute regarding the amount of the statutory redundancy lump sum. </p>  <p>  Any arrangement or agreement relating to the calculation of a redundancy payment which is over and above the statutory redundancy entitlement is a voluntary matter between employers and employees and their union representatives.

It underlines the sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy, and it illustrates the potential which exists for this sector to grow even further. The creation of 23,000 additional jobs all along the supply chain from producer level to high-end value-added product development are among the ambitious and challenging growth projections for the industry over the timeframe of the plan. </p>  <p>  Ireland operates a managed employment permits system maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market.  The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy.  However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review. </p>  <p>  In May 2018 a pilot quota-based scheme was introduced to remove the occupations of meat processing operative, horticulture worker and dairy farm assistant from the ineligible occupations list. The scheme initially provided 250 general employment permits for the meat processing industry to address the immediate needs of the sector in sourcing labour. On foot of further evidence produced by the sector, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, it was decided to extend the pilot scheme on three occasions. A total of 2,500 permits were made available to meat processing operatives. A total of 660 permits have been made available for meat deboners. The extensions of the pilot scheme for meat processing operatives ensured that the sector&rsquo;s immediate difficulties were addressed and the potential that a lack of available labour could constrict growth was minimised.  Both these quotas are now exhausted. </p>  <p>  In June 2021, I announced the outcome of the most recent review  of the occupation lists with changes made in respect of certain occupations in the healthcare sector. No change was recommended in respect of the meat processing sector at that time, given the continuing uncertainty in the labour market caused by COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  A further review is underway at present with consideration of the 26 submissions received.

It underlines the sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy, and it illustrates the potential which exists for this sector to grow even further. The creation of 23,000 additional jobs all along the supply chain from producer level to high-end value-added product development are among the ambitious and challenging growth projections for the industry over the timeframe of the plan. </p><p>The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages, however, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. It is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit. The Iists are subject to twice yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, a public consultation process, input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.  Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19 and their impact on the labour market.</p><p>In May 2018, following a detailed business case submitted by the sector, my Department introduced a pilot quota-based scheme to remove the occupations of horticulture worker, meat processing operative and dairy farm assistant from the ineligible occupations list.  This pilot scheme proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector and 500 permits were made available to the Horticulture sector. At present, the quota for Horticulture Worker has expired. </p><p>The outcome of the review referenced in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 135 on 5th May 2021, was announced on 14th June, with changes made in respect of certain occupations in the healthcare sector. No change was recommended in respect of the horticulture sector at that time. There was continuing uncertainty in the labour market caused by COVID-19. In addition, initiatives involving sector representatives working closely with the Department of Social Protection on a  recruitment campaign &lsquo;Harvest2Harvest&rsquo; to support the recruitment of temporary workers from both the live register and across the European Union were underway. The report did recommend that this issue be kept under review, mindful of the need to protect food supplies in the event that workers cannot be sourced locally or from the EEA.</p><p>A further review is underway at present with consideration of the 26 submissions received underway, including from the horticulture sector. The review is expected to be finalised in the early autumn. </p></reply>

The Irish standard (I.S. 419:2011) and regulations (SI No. 316/1995) were introduced to protect consumers by preventing the rapid spread of a fire started on or near furniture. The Irish Regulations set out a more robust safety standard than applies in other EU Member States in order to provide a higher level of safety in this area.</p>  <p>  A public consultation was conducted in late 2019 by the Department on the future of the Irish regulations. Due to the onset of the Covid-19 epidemic, the public consultation period was extended as not all stakeholders could comply with the original deadline. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently reviewing the responses to the public consultation which we received from a wide variety of stakeholders.  The submissions received were very detailed and will take time to evaluate to ensure that the recommendations are based on robust evidence.  There have been a number of reports comparing mortality rates due to fires in the EU and the United States along with reports looking at the causes of domestic fires and these reports are being taken into account by my officials, where relevant.</p>  <p>  I hope to have recommendations on any revised regulations on foot of that evaluation process later in the year. </p></reply>

The Covid pandemic has certainly brought remote working centre stage and work on this important legislation is well advanced.</p><p>The Bill will set out a clear framework to facilitate remote and blended work options, in so far as possible. It will ensure that when an employer declines a request, there are stated reasons for doing so. Remote working will not work for everyone, so we will take a balanced approach with the legislation.</p><p>On 20th August, a summary report of the submissions on my Department's website was published.</p><p>Cabinet approval will be sought for the drafting of Heads of a Bill in Quarter 4 2021. The Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible thereafter. The intention is to introduce a mechanism for employees to request remote working that is fair but does not place an undue burden on employers.</p><p>In the meantime, we will also continue to provide up to date advice, guidance and information on all aspects of remote working for workers and employers.</p><p>On 28<sup>th</sup>June the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment launched the Department&rsquo;s Making Remote Work campaign. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the advice and information available from Government to help workers and employers facilitate more remote and blended working. This includes guidance for employers and workers and a Remote Working Checklist which are all available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

These Acts provide for the setting of a national minimum wage and also provide that in specified circumstances, a reduced, subminimum rate may be applied. </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was requested, as part of its 2016 work programme, to examine the sub-minimum rates (special training and youth rates) of the national minimum wage and to report its recommendations. </p>  <p>  The subsequent 2017 Low Pay Commission report on subminimum rates sets out a clear evidence base and rationale for its recommendations.  The Commission commissioned research by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), which examined international practices in relation to the national minimum wage and subminimum rates.  The ESRI research found that of the 26 OECD countries (out of 34) that have a statutory national minimum wage, just over half include subminimum rates for young people.  </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission considered abolishing youth rates but concluded that the minimum wage rate would then no longer offer any recognition of the difference between a young inexperienced worker and a more experienced colleague, which could lead to employers no longer seeing a value in hiring young people (and potentially impact on youth employment rates). The Low Pay Commission also concluded that abolishing youth rates could potentially act as an incentive for young people to leave education and take up employment, which could have a negative impact on their long-term prospects.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the Commission recommended that the youth rates should be simplified and be changed to an age-based system. The Commission also recommended that the trainee rates should be abolished. These recommendations were accepted by Government and the changes came into effect on 4 March 2019.  </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Commission recommended that the rate for employees under the age of 18 should also be retained in acknowledgement of the fact that such employees have a statutory restriction on their working hours and conditions under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. </p></reply>

Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the Commission is independent in the performance of its functions. As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Commission,  the Minister for, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I have no direct function in the matter.</p>  <p>  Since the Deputy&rsquo;s previous PQ in March, the CCPC has informed my department that they have received an update from the Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de La Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R&eacute;pression des Fraudes (&lsquo;DGCCRF&rsquo;). The update related to the progress of their investigation and was to be passed on to complainants. The CCPC issued that update to all complainants in July. </p>  <p>  At the time that update was provided, the DGCCRF advised that they will inform the CCPC when reports are handed over to the Public Prosecutor in France and they will draw the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s attention to the importance of keeping complainants informed about the state of play of proceedings. Complainants were advised at the time that as this is a DGCCRF criminal investigation, the next stage of which involves the handing over of reports to the French Public Prosecutor, the CCPC would not be in a position to comment further, unless requested or authorised to do so by the DGCCRF. However, the CCPC have informed me that they have continued to engage with complainants who contacted them and provide any information they can. Where the CCPC have been unable to answer complainants queries, they have passed them on to the DGCCRF and communicated back any clarifications that they provided.</p>  <p>  Regarding the role of Irish agents in the sale of these properties, in response to a previous PQ, the CCPC stated that when the DGCCRF have completed their investigation, the DGCCRF will provide to the CCPC, information on any potential concerns or infringements with respect to Irish agents identified during the course of their investigation. At that point, the CCPC will assess the information provided by the DGCCRF in order to determine whether there may have been a breach of consumer protection legislation by Irish traders. Following any such assessment, the CCPC will decide the necessary next steps. The CCPC are continuing to assist the DGCCRF&rsquo;s efforts. Their approach continues to be one of providing assistance to the DGCCRF in relation to the investigation and that includes the role that Irish traders may have had in relation to the alleged conduct. That assistance is continuing at this time. Given that this is an ongoing operational matter for the CCPC, you will appreciate that the CCPC are not in a position to provide further detail.  </p></reply>

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.</p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market.

The sector has also previously been advised that a more systematic and structured engagement with the Department of Social Protection needs to be demonstrated.</p>  <p>  If a sector wishes to propose a change to the occupations lists, they need to submit a detailed evidence-based business case to substantiate their request.

Our Economic Recovery Plan, published in June, commits to ongoing support for people and businesses to make a full return to work.  Assisting businesses and people in those sectors where the impacts of the pandemic have been most severe is prioritised in the plan in a targeted way. Our Economic Recovery Plan also sets out medium term policies to underpin a sustainable and balanced recovery and a commitment to invest in infrastructure and reforms to enhance our capability and long-term capacity for growth. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery and to getting people back to work as quickly as possible. While numbers in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment continue to reduce, significant numbers of people remain in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment in Accommodation and Food Service Activities (27,545), Wholesale and Retail Trade (22,434) and Administrative and support service activities (16,504), and construction (11,725) sectors.</p>  <p>  Our Economic Recovery Plan set an ambitious target to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by having 2.5 million people in work by 2024 and in more productive and resilient jobs. The Plan commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment. As the PUP is phased out, helping people back to work and reducing the risk of labour market scarring and entrenched long-term unemployment is a priority for Government. This will be achieved through a combination of upskilling and reskilling with substantially accelerated training and skills opportunities and increased activation capacity through Pathways to Work 2021-2025. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which targets 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025, is an important mechanism to address skills shortages in particular sectors. Retail Ireland&rsquo;s Skillnet Apprenticeship in Retail Supervision and the National Hairdressing Apprenticeship are good examples of programmes providing job-ready qualified professionals in those sectors. My colleagues, Simon Harris, TD, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and Niall Collins, TD, Minister of State for Skills and Further Education, recently announced a further extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021 which provides financial support for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship. </p>  <p>  The pandemic has accelerated previously existing trends and shifts which have potential to significantly reshape business models and sectors.  Many of these changes are likely to be permanent with potential to fundamentally alter Ireland&rsquo;s economic outlook. Not all previous jobs will return, while capacity constraints may emerge very quickly in certain areas. The twin decarbonisation and digitalisation transition and associated behavioural changes will profoundly alter the economy. </p>  <p>  Embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and support significant job creation. Identifying and developing the skills required in growing sectors of the economy is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) advises the Government on projected skills requirements across the Irish economy and makes recommendations on how existing education and training systems and delivery mechanisms, as well as other sources of skills supply, can be improved. </p>  <p>  Innovation, collaboration and knowledge are the cornerstone of a sustainable growth model and underpin the agility needed to respond to an evolving sectoral landscape.  The Government is committed to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile, by increasing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, and through a focus on expanding sectors. The education, training and research sectors will be supported to respond to the challenge. </p></reply>

Now, as we cautiously emerge from these necessary public health restrictions and global markets begin to open again, the Government will continue to help businesses in their next phase of recovery and adaptation. </p>  <p>  My Department has invested to help businesses overcome these challenges. To deliver on this working with our agency Enterprise Ireland the strategic priorities are to strengthen Irish enterprise to respond to market shocks and disruption in response to COVID-19 and Brexit. </p>  <p>  To drive transformational change and the pace of innovation transitioning to new business models, digitalisation and the low carbon economy and to scale and grow the export and start-up base, across regions and sectors and grow companies of all sizes.</p>  <p>  Last week, I led the first in-person Trade Mission following the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and since the onset of Covid-19, to London, Paris and Berlin to assist the accelerated export-led recovery of Irish businesses in the UK and Eurozone, Ireland&rsquo;s closest markets.  The UK, France and Germany combined represent 39% of total Enterprise Ireland client exports in 2020, with over 2,300 Enterprise Ireland client companies exporting to these three markets. This mission offered the opportunity to build relationships and increase awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s offering and why it is an attractive place to invest.</p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts driven by our agencies, key to our success in growing exports has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to establish new markets for our indigenous sectors. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to help the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p></reply>

The strong growth recorded in GDP terms was due to the impact of the multinational sector, with both pharma and ICT performing well. </p>  <p>  As more of the economy has re-opened in recent months the domestic economy has now started to grow again.  The latest available data shows that MDD grew by 8.4% in Q2 2021, which was helped by an increase in investment. This was the second highest quarterly growth rate on record, second only to the third quarter of last year, when the economy bounced-back after the first lockdown. As a result, MDD has now surpassed its pre-pandemic level. </p>  <p>  This growth was broad based, with almost every sector in the domestic economy recording strong growth, with the information and communication sector (6.2%) and the construction sector (22.9%) recording particularly strong growth.</p>  <p>  Looking forward, the Department of Finance have forecast that MDD will continue to record robust growth into 2022, and expect it to increase by 7.4 percent next year.</p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan sets out through its four pillars how the Government will navigate the immediate recovery, and also the fundamental and accelerating challenges and opportunities the country faces.

Our Economic Recovery Plan commits to ongoing support for businesses and people to provide certainty and confidence for employers to continue to operate and re-employ staff members, with enhanced support for the worst affected sectors, as well as signalling the gradual phasing out of the PUP.  The Plan also sets out medium term policies to underpin a sustainable and balanced recovery and a commitment to invest in infrastructure and reforms to enhance our capability and long-term capacity for growth. </p>  <p>  Although the numbers in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment continues to reduce, there are still a significant amount of people who remain in receipt of this payment,with the highest numbers in the Accommodation and Food Service Activities (27,545), Wholesale and Retail Trade (22,434), Administrative and support service activities (16,504), and construction (11,725) sectors.  </p>  <p>  Extension of the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme, which subsidises a portion of labour costs, until 31 December 2021 gives businesses the opportunity to trade profitably even when operating under ongoing constraints. Extension of the Covid Restriction Support Scheme to the end of the year, the Business Resumption Scheme, broadening of the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID grant and continued deferral of tax liabilities further demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help businesses to continue trading and restore employment.</p>  <p>  Our Economic Recovery Plan set an ambitious target to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by having 2.5 million people in work by 2024 and in more productive and resilient jobs. The Plan commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment and ensure employers can access the skills they need. As the PUP is phased out, helping people back to work and reducing the risk of labour market scarring and entrenched long-term unemployment is a priority for Government. This will be achieved through a combination of upskilling and reskilling with substantially accelerated training and skills opportunities and increased activation capacity through Pathways to Work 2021-2025. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which targets 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025, is an important mechanism to address skills shortages in particular sectors. Retail Ireland&rsquo;s Skillnet Apprenticeship in Retail Supervision and the National Hairdressing Apprenticeship are good examples of programmes providing job-ready qualified professionals in those sectors. My colleagues, Simon Harris, TD, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and Niall Collins, TD, Minister of State for Skills and Further Education, recently announced a further extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021 which provides financial support for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship. </p>  <p>  The pandemic has accelerated previously existing trends and shifts which have potential to significantly reshape business models and sectors.  Many of these changes are likely to be permanent with potential to fundamentally alter Ireland&rsquo;s economic outlook. Not all previous jobs will return, while capacity constraints may emerge very quickly in certain areas. The twin decarbonisation and digitalisation transition and associated behavioural changes will profoundly alter the economy. </p>  <p>  Embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and support significant job creation. Identifying and developing the skills required in growing sectors of the economy is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) advises the Government on projected skills requirements across the Irish economy and makes recommendations on how existing education and training systems and delivery mechanisms, as well as other sources of skills supply, can be improved. The education, training and research sectors will be supported to respond to the challenge. </p></reply>

Many trends and shifts that have been emerging for some time have been accelerated. Trends such as the growing digital economy; decarbonising the economy; labour market composition changes; and global developments such as Brexit, geo-political change, trade protectionism, international taxation among others. Some of the most noticeable changes include the shift to online retail and to electronic payments, and to greater levels of remote working. Each of these trends on their own has the potential to reshape businesses and lifestyles in significant ways creating new challenges and also opportunities. </p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan, which was published in June, sets out the Government&rsquo;s approach to recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic and to ensure that we are prepared to realise the opportunities that these evolving trends will present. The most immediate challenge in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic is the scale of the unemployment challenge. This will require a determined and relentless focus on helping people back to work, accelerating the provision of training, reskilling and upskilling to assist people to transition to new jobs in growing sectors of the economy. The Economic Recovery Plan sets out our overall ambition of exceeding pre-crisis employment levels by reaching 2.5 million people in work by the end of 2024. Crucially these jobs will be more productive, innovative, resilient and in new areas of opportunity, aligned with the Government&rsquo;s green and digital ambitions.</p>  <p>  Central to the employment challenge is getting people back to work as quickly as possible. This will be achieved intense activation and skills development including by increasing the caseload of the Public Employment Service by 100,000 per annum; providing a new Work Placement Experience Programme, to reach 10,000 participants by the end of 2022; accelerating the rollout of 50,000 education and training places; and providing for a SOLAS Recovery Skills Response Programme to provide a range of additional education and training interventions including the SOLAS Green Skills Action programme.</p>  <p>  The pandemic may also have exacerbated Ireland&rsquo;s two-tiered economy, increasing the gap between domestic and export orientated firms.  Our Economic Recovery Plan outlines a two-pronged recovery approach; a focus on domestic SMEs, whilst leveraging and reinforcing the enormous strength and resilience of the Foreign Direct Investment sector in Ireland and its indispensable contribution to communities across the country.</p>  <p>  The Plan outlines measures to improve SME productivity, exporting activity, internationalisation and diversification, digitalisation, and business dynamism, as well as greening enterprise, in order to boost the resilience, of Irish SMEs to current and future shocks and disruptions. The SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan, published earlier this year, gives Government a clear set of recommendations, directly from the business community, on how to build the best business and regulatory environment possible for SMEs and entrepreneurs to come back stronger from COVID and become more resilient over the longer-term. The implementation of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategic framework will further reinforce these efforts and strengthen Irish enterprise to respond to market shocks. Through the delivery of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, and complementary trade initiatives, Ireland will enhance its value proposition for FDI and aim to win 800 total investments to aid job creation of 50,000 across the country.</p>  <p>  The new Housing for All strategy, which will target of 33,000 homes every year, will not only drive considerable direct and indirect employment opportunities but will also address supply constraints in terms of housing which continues to be a challenge.  Our ambitious retrofitting goals, supported by a Loan guarantee for Low-Cost Residential Retrofit Loan Scheme, will further drive employment in the construction sector. </p>  <p>  The ambitious programmes outlined in the Plan will be underpinned by substantial capital investment under the revised National Development Plan, as well as &euro;915 million expected in a first tranche of funding under the European Recovery and Resilience Facility. The EU&rsquo;s Brexit Adjustment Reserve will also be an important vehicle to support recovery by helping to counter the adverse economic and social consequences of Brexit. </p></reply>

Ireland has expressed broad support for the agreement reached by OECD countries in July 2021 to address tax challenges arising from digitalisation and globalisation. </p>  <p>  While Ireland is not yet in a position to join the agreement and, specifically, a global minimum effective tax rate of &lsquo;at least 15%&rsquo;, the Government remains committed to the process and aims to find an outcome that Ireland can support. </p>  <p>  The OECD proposals are of significant economic importance to Ireland and so my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and his Department, recently launched a public consultation on the OECD proposals. </p>  <p>  Despite the changes that global tax reforms will bring, as the results of 2020 and 2021 have shown, Ireland remains a highly competitive place to do business and has much to offer prospective inward investors. </p>  <p>  The challenges of 2020 have demonstrated the remarkable resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s economy. In GDP terms, Ireland was one of the best performing economies in the world. </p>  <p>  Even with the challenges faced in 2020, owing to both Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, Ireland saw significant increases in foreign direct investment. In the first half of this year, with the continued hard work of IDA, Ireland has won 142 FDI investments, accounting for 12,530 jobs; this is an increase of 31% on the same figures in 2020.</p>  <p>  Companies establishing in Ireland get the benefits of a young and highly educated workforce, a stable, business-friendly environment, and an unwavering commitment to EU Membership as well as access to the European Single Market.

Published on January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2021, the Strategy aims to ensure that remote work is a permanent feature of the Irish workplace in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits.</p><p>The Strategy contains 15 actions to progress remote work into the future, organised into three pillars and underpinning conditions: These pillars are:</p><p>1. Create a Conducive Environment </p><p>2. Develop and Leverage Remote Work Infrastructure</p><p>3. Build a Remote Work Policy and Guidance Framework </p><p>Each action has been attributed actors to lead on delivery and is scheduled to be delivered by the end of this year. Progress on the actions is reported to the Interdepartmental Group (IDG) on Remote Work. This IDG has met three times to date this year, most recently on September 7<sup>th</sup>, 2021. At these meetings it has been established that good progress has been made in achieving most actions by their deadlines. The next meeting of the IDG will take place in November.</p><p>To further aid employers and employees with remote work adoption, on June 28<sup>th</sup>,<sup></sup>2021, my Department launched the &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo; campaign across broadcast, print and social media to promote the Guidance for Working Remotely webpage. This webpage acts as a central access point for employers and employees and brings together the existing State guidance, legislation and advice on remote work into one place. The webpage includes an Employer Checklist to provide employers with a quick way to successfully navigate the adoption of remote working arrangements. As we approach the return to the office, I am encouraging employers and employees to discuss the kinds of remote working arrangements that may be suitable for their organisations.</p></reply>

In order to improve traceability of waste received and to counter the trade in stolen metal, an amendment to the Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) Regulations was introduced in 2014 to require the following at all permitted facilities receiving/purchasing waste:    - the production of proof of identity and current address for the person supplying the material; </p>  <p>  - records to be kept of the registration number and waste collection permit number of the delivery vehicle;</p>  <p>  - records to be kept describing the materials, time and date of sale, weight and amount paid; and </p>  <p>  - the provision of a signed statement by the person supplying the material indicating that they are the lawful owner.</p>  <p>  The Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) have issued guidance to all waste facility permit holders, including Authorised Treatment Facilities (ATFs) for end-of-life vehicles, advising them of their responsibilities in this regard and local authorities continue to undertake inspections to ensure compliance with the regulations.

To date, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme.  In the first six months of 2021, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was approximately &euro;17,100.  There are currently over 7,000 people on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the average time from application to completion was almost 26 months.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>The SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.</p><p>The average wait times have increased significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in place between January and mid-April when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Wait times have also been negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead times for materials. </p><p>Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased significantly to over &euro;109 million in 2021, with &euro;100 million allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty.  The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. In addition, delivery capacity in the supply chain has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.  Every effort is being made to maximise activity now that construction activity in the residential sector has recommenced.</p></reply>

The Government is fully committed to addressing this challenge. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 commits Ireland to  achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050, and provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (compared to 2018 levels). It also establishes a  significantly strengthened climate governance  framework to support delivery of these targets.</p>  <p>  My objective over the coming weeks is to agree an ambitious and comprehensive set of climate actions, through the Climate Action Plan 2021, that will position us to meet our new climate targets. This will mean more renewable energy, decreased transport emissions, changes in how we heat our homes and how we grow our food and look after our land. These steps will be challenging but they will also create new opportunities.International cooperation and coordination is also needed to limit global temperature rises. In this context, I will lead Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Delegation for COP26. Ireland is committed to engaging constructively in the finalisation of the Paris Rulebook and will also continue to advocate for climate action that is informed by the best available science.  </p></reply>

The Act comprises a framework designed to achieve a low carbon, climate resilient, and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. The Act provides for a statutory plan which will guide policy in relation to climate change adaption. This plan, the National Adaptation Framework (NAF), approved by Government, was published in January 2018. Under the NAF, the Climate Action Plan 2019 and as required by section 6 of the Climate Act, a Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Electricity and Gas Networks Sector was approved by Government in October 2019. This Sectoral Adaptation Plan identifies key climate impacts on the energy sector including flooding, changes in precipitation, temperature rise, sea level rise, changes in the energy content of wind and extreme weather events. </p><p>The Sectoral Adaptation Plan identified the following key infrastructures types as being particularly vulnerable to the key climate change impacts: electricity generation plants; overhead electricity transmission and distribution lines; underground cables and stations; large wind farms; gas pipelines; and gas substations. The  Sectoral Adaptation Plan, which sets outs a range of actions to further identify and adapt to key climate impacts, can be found on the Government of Ireland website, www.gov.ie/en/collection/51df3-sectoral-adaptation-planning/.</p></reply>

An information booklet on the scheme, which included the basis for calculating payments, was made publically available and was circulated to applicants in advance of the application process.  </p>  <p>  The scheme was available to persons who had held a fishing licence or permit in 2007 (the base year). A tax free sum was paid to qualifying persons in respect of each of the five reckonable years (2003-2007).

The associated EXEED Certified grant scheme was re-launched in January 2021 by the SEAI. It supports organisations with the costs of embedding energy efficient design in their assets, to reduce lifecycle impact with lower energy use and carbon emissions. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the SEAI that there have been 82 EXEED Stage 1 grant applications received since the programme re-opened in January 2021. These are applications for grant support for professional fees related to conducting a suite of pre-investment studies to identify the opportunities for embedding energy efficient design in an asset. I understand that 63 Stage 1 letters of offer have been issued this year. Of these, over 30 studies have now been completed and one grant draw down has been completed. Grant payments will be processed for the remaining projects in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  　I am also advised that there have been 49 EXEED Stage 2 grant applications received since January 2021. These are applications for grant support for capital investment projects which will commence after a grant offer is made. Grant offers have been made for 7 projects so far this year. There have been no grant drawdowns so far for these projects. Grant drawdowns will only take place following completion of the works. </p>  <p>   </p>  <p>  An expression of interest is not an application to the programme but a request for information and is not specific to Stage 1 or Stage 2. SEAI advise me there have been a total of 237 expressions of interest in the EXEED Certified grant scheme received since it re-opened in January 2021.</p></reply>

Since 2000, over 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light. </p>  <p>  Support to upgrade dormer bungalow homes is available under SEAI grant schemes. However, SEAI have advised that the technical requirements to address these homes can be challenging due to the construction style and the follow on insulation and ventilation requirements.

The actions being progressed include maximising the availability of existing generators; development of new generation capacity &ndash; including temporary generation capacity in advance of winter 2022; making changes to the grid connection rules for data centres; and working with large energy consumers to, where possible, reduce their electricity demand during peak periods. </p>  <p>  In June 2018 the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Policy&rsquo; was published, which sets out the strategic importance of data centres to Ireland&rsquo;s overarching enterprise policy and attracting foreign investment in the ICT sector. The statement acknowledges that, as large consumers of electricity, data centres also pose challenges to the capacity of our electricity grid and the future planning and operation of a sustainable power system. </p>  <p>  In June, the CRU published a proposed direction to EirGrid and ESB Networks that would require each of the system operators to prioritise data centre connections based on location, the availability of on-site generation and flexibility in reducing demand when required. I understand that the CRU do not propose an outright ban on the connection of data centres. The consultation process is now closed and the CRU is considering the responses received. </p></reply>

The actions being progressed include maximising the availability of existing generators; development of new generation capacity &ndash; including temporary generation capacity in advance of winter 2022; making changes to the grid connection rules for data centres; and working with large energy consumers to, where possible, reduce their electricity demand during peak periods. </p>  <p>  In June 2018 the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Policy&rsquo; was published, which sets out the strategic importance of data centres to Ireland&rsquo;s overarching enterprise policy and attracting foreign investment in the ICT sector. The statement acknowledges that, as large consumers of electricity, data centres also pose challenges to the capacity of our electricity grid and the future planning and operation of a sustainable power system. </p>  <p>  In June, the CRU published a proposed direction to EirGrid and ESB Networks that would require each of the system operators to prioritise data centre connections based on location, the availability of on-site generation and flexibility in reducing demand when required. I understand that the CRU do not propose an outright ban on the connection of data centres. The consultation process is now closed and the CRU is considering the responses received. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government included a commitment to undertake a capacity review of the NCSC to benchmark the Centre against similar agencies in Europe and internationally and inform future investment in staffing and technology.Earlier this year my Department commissioned independent international consultants to conduct the capacity review and it was completed in June of this year. Following consideration of the Capacity Review and its recommendations, the Government in agreed in July to an expansion of the NCSC from 26 to 45 staff over the next 18 months, and to 70 within 5 years. The associated budgetary increase for the NCSC for 2022 is estimated at &euro;2.5 million. The Government also agreed a significant package of measures to further strengthen the capacity of the NCSC to respond to the growing threat from cyber criminals, including the development of legislation to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis with a set of formal powers and a legal mandate. The overall package of measures agreed by Government includes:</p><p>That the role of Director of the NCSC be re-advertised at a salary of &euro;184,000 (Deputy Secretary scale) to reflect the scale and importance of the role and to attract experienced candidates</p><p>- The Director will have responsibility for building and leading the NCSC, further developing the operational capacity and expertise of the NCSC and supporting the development of the policy and legislative framework relating to cyber security in the State</p><p>- A single HQ for the NCSC which will provide the required security infrastructure and capacity. The NCSC will be accommodated within the Department&rsquo;s new Headquarters (HQ) in Beggars Bush</p><p>- Developing a 5 year technology strategy for the NCSC that scopes its internal requirements, and its relationship with academia and industry</p><p>- In addition to the recruitment of additional fulltime roles, a cyber security graduate training programme will be initiated by the NCSC in 2021, with four computer science graduates recruited each year on contracts of three years duration.</p><p>My Department is now progressing implementation of these measures.</p><p>The number of staff working in the National Cyber Security Centre in each of the years 2016 to 2020 and to date in 2021 is set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>End 2016</th>       <th>7</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>End 2017</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>End 2018</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>End 2019</td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>End 2020</td>       <td>25</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>To Date 2021</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to lower income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. During the first 6 months of 2021, the approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was &euro;17,100.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,000 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme who have never received any upgrade works under the scheme. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the average time from application to completion was almost 26 months. The SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.</p>  <p>  Revisits under this scheme are currently not available. This enables the work programme to prioritise eligible homes that have not previously received free upgrades under the scheme. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will be finalised and published shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer.</p></reply>

In addition to the Ballina rail freight service, all of Tara Mines exports of lead and zinc ore concentrate are delivered to Dublin Port by rail. </p>  <p>  I believe that Dublin Port and Irish Rail are also committed to working towards facilitating rail freight to the port in the longer term. </p>  <p>  As of today Dublin Port remains the only port in Ireland through which cargo moves by rail.  Rail accounts for 0.7% of all movements of containers and trailers through Dublin Port and 0.6% of all such movements through all Irish Ports. However, I understand that a new twice weekly rail freight service between Ballina and the Port of Waterford is due to commence before the end of the month. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Department for Infrastructure (Northern Ireland) and other relevant stakeholders, is undertaking a strategic review of the heavy rail network on the island of Ireland.  The review will consider all issues in relation to inter-urban and inter-regional rail connectivity, including the potential for high-/higher speed(s), improved connectivity to the North West and rail connectivity to our international gateways, with the latter considering the potential role of rail freight.</p>  <p>  I believe strongly in the potential of rail freight and think it can play a bigger role in freight transport generally on this island. That is why, as part of the strategic rail review, we have included a specific focus on the topic. </p></reply>

I have therefore referred this part of the question to the Authority for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.   </p>  <p>  Covid-19 has had on profound effect on the delivery of the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s driver testing services resulting in a significant backlog. </p>  <p>  Due to suspension of driver testing services in the first 2020 lockdown, along with the health protocols since resumption of service and the further curtailing of services during subsequent level 5 restrictions, a significant backlog has developed. </p>  <p>  Since last October, the driver testing service has been prioritising essential workers. Since May 2021, the RSA has been returning to delivering tests for all customers, while continuing to prioritise critical frontline workers. This means, in the interest of fairness, the RSA targeted test appointments to those waiting longest who are ready and eligible to take the test. The number of tests being offered weekly</p>  <p>  continues to grow </p>  <p>   The service continues to operate under restrictions in the interest of making it safe while there is an ongoing presence of Covid. Given the necessity for a tester to be in close proximity to a test candidate, and to get into vehicles brought by the candidates which are therefore not a controlled environment, this places limits on the capacity of the test service. </p>  <p>  When the service resumed in June 2020, testers were conducting 5 tests each per day, as against 8 before the pandemic. This increased to 6 tests from 14 September 2020. The RSA is looking to increase the number of tests to 7 per tester per day from late September 2021, subject to compliance with health protocols. </p>  <p>  In order to deal with the backlog, the RSA received sanction to hire 40 new temporary testers, in addition to 36 they were sanctioned to retain or rehire in 2020. These new testers have completed their training and are now conducting live tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40 testers and the process has commenced. </p>  <p>   An extra 10 temporary test centres have been opened (and are effectively an expansion of existing locations or replacing unsuitable locations), and a further 9 locations have been expanded within the existing premises, to accommodate more testers. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to be guided by public health advice on the safe provision of services and, in conjunction with the RSA, continues to keep the situation under review to ensure that every possible measure is being put in place so that the maximum number of customers can be served, while adhering to public health requirements. </p></reply>

However since the easing of restrictions on international travel in July 2021, we have seen a welcome increase in international passenger numbers.     </p>  <p>  In addition to passenger travel, Ireland relies on the transport sector for our international connectivity for the continued supply of goods in and out of the country. Since the onset of the pandemic, the Government has been very focused on ensuring that all the elements of the supply chain continue to function for our economic wellbeing.  In April 2020,  the Government introduced the temporary designation of five strategic maritime routes into and out of Ireland as Public Service Obligation routes for a period of up to three months.  In January 2021, my Department put in place testing arrangements for HGV drivers traveling to France following new rules introduced by France requiring HGV drivers to have negative covid tests prior to entering the country. These tests were provided free of charge to HGV drivers at sites in Dublin and Wexford close to Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort until April 2021 and were only discontinued after the requirements by the French authorities were dropped. Ireland also continues to exempt essential transport workers travelling in the course of their international duties from testing and quarantine requirements when entering Ireland in the interests of keeping supply chains open.</p>  <p>  In relation to supports for businesses in general, the Government's Economic Recovery Plan has extended the period during which a range of business supports will be available to enterprises and workers in all sectors of the economy. </p></reply>

Under domestic legislation, professional medical care services recognised as such by the Department of Health are exempt from VAT. Professional medical care services recognised by the Department of Health are generally those medical care services supplied by health professionals who are enrolled, registered, regulated, or designated on the appropriate statutory register provided for under the relevant legislation in force in the State or equivalent legislation applicable in other countries.

Revenue works very closely with businesses and tax practitioners and continues to be flexible and responsive in putting solutions and processes in place that assist and support businesses. Revenue&rsquo;s approach must also have regard to the very considerable supports being provided by Government, the need to make sure that businesses are correctly availing of those supports and the need to ensure ongoing tax compliance by those availing of these supports.</p>  <p>  For taxpayers who file their 2020 Form 11 return and make the appropriate payment through ROS for Preliminary Tax for 2021 and Income Tax balance due for 2020, the due date has already been extended by Revenue from 31 October to Wednesday 17 November 2021. Where access to necessary information for tax returns is being impacted by COVID-related difficulties, the relevant return should be submitted on a &lsquo;best estimate&rsquo; basis. Revenue has advised me that it would expect that the instance of such difficulties is expected to be very low and Revenue has assured me that any subsequent amendments can be completed on a self-correction basis without incurring additional penalties.</p>  <p>  Revenue will continue to monitor the situation over the coming months, but no further extension on filing deadlines is envisaged at this time.

Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme. </p>  <p>  For a property to qualify for HTB it must be new, or, converted for use as a home not having been previously been used as a home. In the circumstances where the house was previously used as a dwelling but knocked down and rebuilt, then it is &ldquo;new&rdquo;. First-time buyers may purchase a site containing a house which is derelict and which they plan to demolish, in whole or in part, with the intention of building a new house. First time buyers intending to undertake such purchases should contact Revenue via MyEnquiries outlining the specific circumstances of their case and Revenue will consider them on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  In relation to second-hand properties more generally, an increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. The HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. A move to include second-hand properties within the scope of the relief might not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply.</p>  <p>  Proposals for new or amended tax measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances, for example where there are demonstrable market failures. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p>  <p>  Finally, the introduction of such measures is a matter that would generally fall to be considered in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill. </p></reply>

From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles.  The 0% BIK rate forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of electric vehicles, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. </p>  <p>  The BIK exemption was intended as a temporary measure and is set to end at year end 2022, coinciding with the onset of the new BIK regime on 1/1/2023. Electric vehicles will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. ICE vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.</p></reply>

This includes the banks in which the State has a shareholding. Such matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  As such the application of interest rate charges is solely a commercial matter for the board and management of each bank.</p>  <p>  I am aware that deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the Covid19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in large part it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. </p>  <p>  The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.</p></reply>

The payment is made from the Department of Social Protection to an individual who fulfils the statutory criteria.  The Act also provides for an increase in the amount of weekly State Pension where the beneficiary of the pension has a qualified adult dependant. The qualified adult portion is described as an &ldquo;increase&rdquo; in the pension and is payable in respect of a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who is being financially maintained and whose income is not greater than a specified amount.   </p>  <p>  The tax treatment of the qualifying adult increase is contained in section 126(2B) Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA). It provides that, for all the purposes of the Income Tax Act, any increase in the State Pension in respect of a qualified adult dependant is treated as if it arises to the beneficiary of the pension. The pension payment is therefore not subject to double taxation, rather it is taxed as the income of the individual who is the beneficiary of the pension, that is, the pensioner. Since the increase is treated as the income of the beneficiary for tax purposes, only one employee (PAYE) tax credit is available in respect of the State Pension, including the qualified adult dependent increase.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that, by virtue of section 188 TCA, a person aged 65 and over is exempt from income tax where his or her total income is less than the relevant exemption limit. For 2021 the limits are &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners and &euro;18,000 for a single individual. An individual or couple whose income is below the respective limit can also apply directly to their financial institution to have interest paid without deduction of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT).</p>  <p>  In addition, section 464 TCA provides for an &ldquo;Age Tax Credit&rdquo; for individuals aged 65 or over, currently &euro;245 for single individuals or &euro;490 for married people or civil partners living together.</p>  <p>  Individuals aged 66 or over are also not liable to pay PRSI and all payments made by the Department of Social Protection are exempt from the Universal Social Charge.</p></reply>

While historically Ireland has been a relatively cash-intensive economy, significant progress has been made and a rapid increase in the take-up of electronic payments is evident. </p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has potentially acted as a catalyst for the move towards digital payments and the move away from cash. According to the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s credit and banking statistics for July 2021, the volume of card transactions, excluding ATM usage, increased by 15 percent compared to July 2020. While ATM withdrawals remain subdued compared to pre-pandemic levels, down 30 per cent on its 2019 monthly average. The latest figures from the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation of Ireland show that on a quarterly basis, the volume of contactless payments increased by 62 per cent year on year to 199 million in the second quarter of 2021, with the value rising by 68 per cent to almost &euro;3.2 billion. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding a significant increase in the take-up of electronic payments, cash remains a vital part of the Irish payment system. A study, commissioned by my Department in 2018, concluded that a fully cashless society would not be an appropriate objective. The Report is available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/f8bfbe-indecon-report-on-benchmarking-of-irelands-payments-industry/</p>  <p>  In September 2020, as part of the EU Digital Finance Package, the European Commission published the Retail Payments Strategy. One of the key aims of the strategy is to maintain access to and acceptance of cash across EU Member States. The strategy recognises the importance of ensuring that there is continued access to cash and that the increased use of digital payment methods does not lead to financial exclusion.</p>  <p>  The Commission aims to further develop the European payments market so Europe can fully reap the benefits of innovation and opportunities that come with digitalisation. Consumer protection is a key part of this work, in order to create safe payment solutions where risks are monitored and mitigated effectively. One element of this is the introduction of strong security requirements for the initiation and processing of electronic payments, which apply to all payment service providers. Payment service providers are now obliged to apply strong customer authentication (SCA) when a payer initiates an electronic payment transaction. SCA requires the customer to go through two-factor authentication made up of elements from two of three separate categories: knowledge, possession, and inherence. This approach is intended to reduce the risk of fraud for all types of electronic payments (especially online payments) and to protect the confidentiality of the user&rsquo;s financial data.</p>  <p>  I have no role in the day to day operations of any bank operating within the State including banks in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in relation to commercial matters such as the application of interest rate charges are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis.</p>  <p>  Key lending and deposit rates are set by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB)having regard to its monetary policy objectives. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts held with the ECB. Banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances, the Irish banks are no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor develops in this area to ensure that consumers have access to a broad range of reliable and innovative services that meet their needs.</p></reply>

Regulation 13(1) sets out the information that must be included in credit agreements in scope of the Consumer Credit Regulations. It requires that a credit agreement sets out in a clear and concise manner various information, including contractual terms and conditions.</p><p>The ability to amend conditions of existing loans, for example, waiving a guarantee on a loan, would be governed by the terms and conditions of the existing loan.</p><p><b>Credit Union Act 1997</b></p><p>Credit unions must also comply with the Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act). Sections 35 to 38 of the 1997 Act are the relevant sections on credit union loans.</p><p>Section 35(2) of the 1997 Act states:</p><p>&ldquo;A credit union may make a loan to a member for such purpose as the credit union considers appropriate, upon such security (or without security) and terms as the rules of the credit union may provide. The ability of the loan applicant to repay shall be the primary consideration in the underwriting process of the credit union&rdquo;.</p><p>The Registry of Credit Unions has developed a Credit Union Handbook the purpose of which is to assist credit unions by bringing together in one place a number of legal and regulatory requirements and guidance that apply to credit unions. The Credit Union Handbook, including the Lending and Consumer Protection chapters, is publicly available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website. Information is also available on the Consumer Protection section of the Central Bank&rsquo;s website.</p><p><b>Complaints</b></p><p>If a consumer is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are not happy with the response they receive, they can refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) where the complaint comes within the jurisdiction of the FSPO.</p></reply>

The EU Procurement Directives were transposed into Irish Law in 2016 and 2017 under S.I. No. 284/2016 (the &ldquo;2016 Regulations&rdquo;); S.I. No. 286/2016 (the &ldquo;2016 Utilities Regulations&rdquo;) and S.I. No. 203/2017 (the &ldquo;2017 Concessions Regulations&rdquo;).</p>  <p>  The procedures for public bodies, when tendering for goods and services, above and below the EU Thresholds, are set out in the Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services published by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) and are available here:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/c23f5-public-procurement-guidelines-for-goods-and-services/</p>  <p>  These Guidelines set out the procurement procedures to be followed by Government Departments and State Bodies under National and EU rules. The guidelines are to support contracting authorities, including the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), the four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and private entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body, when awarding contracts for goods and services.</p>  <p>  For all works and works-related services (above and below the relevant threshold) contracting authorities should consult the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) available here www.gov.ie/en/service/1d443-capital-works-management-framework/# . The CWMF is an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material and technical procedures which covers all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review.  The CWMF is for the use by contracting authorities involved in the expenditure of public funds on construction projects and related consultancy services. It includes a range of standard template documents and guidance material defining procedures to be followed for the procurement of works contractors and service providers such as architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, etc.</p>  <p>  Contracts with estimated values equal to or above the EU thresholds must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) and awarded in accordance with the provisions of the 2016 Regulations.  There are six award procedures that contracting authorities may utilise when awarding contracts above EU threshold under the 2016 Regulations :</p>  <p>  - Open Procedure</p>  <p>  - Restricted  Procedure</p>  <p>  - Competitive Dialogue</p>  <p>  - Competitive Procedure With Negotiation</p>  <p>  - Innovative Partnership</p>  <p>  - Negotiated Procedure Without Prior Publication</p>  <p>  The 2016 Regulations introduced a higher threshold procurement regime ( &ldquo;light-touch&rdquo; regime) for social and other specific services listed in Annex XIV of the EU Directive 2014/24/EU, which are generally considered to be of lower interest to cross-border competition .</p>  <p>  Regulation 77 of the 2016 Regulations allows contracting authorities to reserve certain contracts for health, social and cultural services to organisations such as not-for-profit organisations which meet certain conditions, namely the pursuit of a public service mission linked to the delivery of the relevant services and reinvestment of profits in the organisation. The duration of the contract cannot be longer than three years and the organisation can not have been awarded a contract for the services by the contracting authority under this regulation within the proceeding three years.</p>  <p>Regulation 32 sets out an exhaustive list of limited circumstances where the Negotiated Procedure without Prior Publication may be used. The absence of a call for competition is a departure from the core principles of openness, transparency and competition and as such is a very exceptional procedure. For example, this procedure may be used for the purchase of goods and services where no tenders or no suitable tenders are submitted, in cases of extreme urgency not attributable to the contracting authority and brought about by unforeseen events, the creation or acquisition of a unique work of art or artistic performance, there is only one possible supplier or service provider, for the purposes of research, experimentation, study or development, where the contract follows a design contest.   </p></reply>

The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m for the Fund over the period to 2027. </p><p>There are two streams of funding within the LSSIF. Stream One provides assistance for the development of detailed plans and cost effective analysis for proposed projects to bring them to tender stage.  Stream Two provides assistance for the construction or delivery of a project.</p><p>It was open to all local authorities and National Governing Bodies (NGBs) to apply for funding. All applications were assessed in accordance with the published Evaluation Procedures and Guidelines and the published scoring system both of which are available at the following link:-</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/service/4113b3-large-scale-sport-infrastructure-fund-lssif/. </p><p>Amongst the key factors in assessing applications was the likelihood of a project increasing participation (including for those with a disability), the priority afforded to the project by the relevant local authority and/or NGB, the level of socio economic disadvantage in the area and whether the proposed project would be shared by a number of different potential users.</p><p>The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and, thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals. These initial allocations included funding for 8 swimming pool projects under Stream 2 of the LSSIF: </p><p>1.  Laois: Portarlington Leisure Centre Swimming Pool</p><p>2.  Sligo: Waterpoint Aqua Park </p><p>3.  Kilkenny: The Watershed Development, </p><p>4.  Limerick: Askeaton Pool and Leisure </p><p>5.  Wicklow: Wicklow Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre</p><p>6.  Louth: Dundalk Leisure Centre</p><p>7.  Galway: Galway Regional Aquatic &amp;amp; Fitness Centre</p><p>8.  Dublin: Samuel Beckett Civic Campus Phase 2</p><p>All of these projects are now at various stages of the due diligence process in keeping with the public spending code.</p><p>Previously, Government support for new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools was provided through the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP). 52 pools have been completed under the LASPP and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme.  A list of the completed projects is attached.</p><p>In relation to future swimming pool needs, my Department is currently undertaking a review of progress on all existing LSSIF grants. As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals and it is expected that the review will be completed in the coming months. In addition, the National Sports Policy commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. This will involve close collaboration with relevant Government Departments, Local Authorities, sporting bodies and other stakeholders. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, a Sports Action Plan, covering the period to end 2023 will be published shortly. It is envisaged that the development of a national swimming strategy will be significantly progressed as a priority action in that plan, with the aim of completing the strategy in early 2022.  <table>

The 2018 round of the Programme closed for applications on Friday 19th October, 2018. By that deadline, 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding. Allocations were announced in January, May and November of 2019 with a total of over &euro;56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects. To date, over &euro;24 million has been drawn down by grantees.</p>  <p>  The club referred to by the Deputy was provisionally allocated a grant of &euro;86,018 under the 2018 round for security fencing and the development of a natural playing surface. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the SCEP and due to the level of grants received by the club in the past, it is necessary to execute a Deed of Covenant and Charge in order to protect the public investment in the facility. Legal formalities in relation to this grant have not yet been finalised and it will not be possible to provide formal approval for the grant until the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office (CSSO) confirms that all matters are in order. I understand that contacts between the CSSO and the club's solicitors are ongoing in this regard. Once the CSSO confirmation is received, there will be no undue delay in paying the grant subject to the other necessary documentation being submitted by the club.</p></reply>

This is in line with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive which sets out requirements for the collection, treatment and discharge of urban waste water with the objective of protecting the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges.</p>  <p>  The EPA is the key statutory body for investigating complaints of pollution and for the enforcement, both directly and through oversight of Irish Water and local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland, including compliance in relation to licensed urban waste water discharges. </p>  <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s report on the performance of urban waste water treatment in 2019 shows that, while many challenges remain, Irish Water is continuing to make progress and is improving our waste water systems.  Irish Water has reduced the number of priority waste water sites listed by the EPA and has increased the number of large towns and cities that now meet the required EU standards for waste water discharges.</p>  <p>  Our entire water system needs substantial and sustained investment over a number of investment cycles to fully improve performance and resilience.  In this regard, as part of Budget 2021, over &euro;1.4 billion was secured to support water services. This includes &euro;1.3 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.</p></reply>

This includes the commitment to ensure that the remediation fund for pyrite and mica is fully drawn down. In this context, &euro;40m was provided under Budget 2021 to cover the implementation of the pyrite remediation scheme and the Defective Concrete Blocks Grants Scheme in 2021. This allocation is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage and defective concrete blocks in private dwellings. </p><p>In regard to the pyrite remediation scheme, the latest figures available indicate that 2,971 applications have been received under the Scheme and, so far, 2,472 dwellings have been included, with 2,222 complete. </p><p>The latest figures available in relation to the Defective Concrete Blocks grant scheme indicate that 513 stage 1 applications have been received with 382 approved as eligible. </p><p>In response to concerns being raised about the Defective Concrete Blocks Grants scheme by homeowners in Donegal and Mayo, I established a working group to review specific aspects of the current scheme. On the request of the homeowner representatives, the timeframe for the working group has been extended to September 30th 2021.</p><p>Separately, there is a commitment to examine the issue of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing report, &ldquo;Safe as Houses&rdquo; and to assist owners of latent defect properties by identifying options for those impacted by defects to access low cost, long term finance.</p><p>In this context, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. The plenary working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021, in addition to subgroup meetings. The group&rsquo;s terms of reference were adopted in May 2021 and include:</p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;. </p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect, </p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage, </p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected, </p><p>- Type of dwelling affected, </p><p>- Location of dwellings affected. </p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated. </p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action. </p><p>5. In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management. </p><p>6. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including: </p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings, </p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work, </p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.  </p><p>7. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options. </p><p>8. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance. </p><p>9. To report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group will seek to engage with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others to examine the issue of defects in housing and report to me on the matter. Consultation with the relevant parties has commenced and further arrangements in this regard are currently being put in place by the working group.</p><p>I am satisfied that the group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter and I look forward to a report in due course following completion of their deliberation.  Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents, any further speculation or discussion on the output of the working group is premature at this stage.</p><p>Finally, in regard to income tax relief and Vat, taxation issues are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance. </p></reply>

This means that people who are divorced/separated and no longer have a financial interest in the family home, or who have undergone insolvency proceedings, will be eligible to apply for State schemes. </p>  <p>  As part of Housing for All, I also announced that a reformed successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL) Scheme, the Local Authority Home Loan, will be in place later in 2021. I will be introducing the new Local Authority Home Loan, which includes an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, once the appropriate Regulations are put in place. I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate for new borrowers by 0.25% under the existing RIHL Scheme from 10 September 2021; this lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the Local Authority Home Loan. </p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing Act 2021 was signed into law by the President on 21 July 2021 and details the provisions under which affordable housing schemes will be delivered.  The Fresh Start principle has already been accommodated in the Affordable Housing Act 2021 with regards to eligibility for the Local Authority Affordable Home Scheme under Part 2 and Section 10 of that Act and the wider assessment of eligibility.  </p>  <p>  On 18 August, I signed the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Commencement) (Parts 1 and 3) Order 2021, which commenced Parts 1 and 3 of the Act from 19 August. This brought into operation the Cost Rental element of the Act. On 2 September 2021, I signed the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2021, which commenced Part 2 (other than subsections (2)(c), (6), and (7) of section 6) and Parts 4, 6, 7, and 8 of the Act from 3 September.  </p>  <p>  With the relevant elements of the Act relating to the Local Authority Affordable Purchase scheme (Part 2) and Cost Rental (part 3) now commenced, it is my intention to make further Regulations governing the eligibility and price ceilings that will be applicable to these schemes in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Funding applications have already been approved to support the delivery of affordable and cost rental homes through by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies. The first affordable homes for purchase will be made available before the year end in Boherboy by Cork City Council.  The first Cost Rental Units have already been tenanted by Cluid in Taylor Hill, Balbriggan at 40% below comparative rates.  Another Cost Rental development of 50 two bedroomed apartments in Enniskerry Road, D&uacute;n Laoghaire is currently being advertised and will be tenanted before year end. </p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act provides the basis for the establishment of the 'First Home' (shared equity) scheme and which is to be operated and administered by a newly established special purpose vehicle (SPV). It also provides that I, as Minister, may agree the terms by which the equity support may be provided covering, inter alia, areas such as purchaser eligibility and financial means, the homes that may be considered eligible under the scheme, and the amount of funding that can be provided.  Work on the detailed design and operation of the scheme is advancing and the Government's recently published Housing For All Plan confirms the intention to introduce the First Home Scheme in Q1 2022.   </p></reply>

While the current three regional communication systems have operated successfully since the early 1990&rsquo;s, the replacement of first generation technology and developing enhanced resilience for the system is enabling us to establish a single national system using the three current Communications Centres. The core elements of the project are:</p><p>- the replacement of mobilisation and communications equipment in all 217 fire stations (complete);</p><p>- the development of resilient communication links between fire stations, the communication centres and the data centres (complete);</p><p>- the migration from our old analogue radio systems to the Tetra digital radio platform used by other emergency services (complete); </p><p>- the development of a new mobilisation software platform which the three communication centres will use for receipt and processing of fire-related 999/112 calls from the public and dispatch of agreed pre-determined fire service response. This new mobilisation system was brought to &quot;technical go-live&quot; stage and operated for a period in one of the communications centres on 27 July 2021 and will be brought to full live status in all three communications centres through a roll-out programme over the coming twelve months. </p><p>The project has had financial support from the Government via the Fire Services Capital Programme, reflecting the effective collaboration of all local authorities in delivering enhanced public safety. The primary purpose of the project is to improve the quality and resilience of fire services communications across the country, ensuring both that we keep our firefighters safe and in turn, allowing them to continue to deliver safer communities.</p><p>My Department provides 100% of the capital funding for the Ctr&iacute; project.

Member States must transpose article 16 of the Directive by 12 January 2023. </p>  <p>  To assist with the transposition of the Directive, and the implementation of the commitment in the Programme for Government, I have convened a Drinking Water Expert Group to provide advice on the appropriate preparations and steps necessary for the successful implementation of the Directive, including article 16, as described above.</p></reply>

My Department assesses, approves and records local authority social housing delivery on a project basis, rather than on the basis of individual unit types.</p><p>My Department has developed Unit Cost Ceilings (UCCs) for social housing in determining the cost of homes to be delivered, which are updated periodically. The UCCs are based on the analysis of returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period, and market tender index information. Construction cost is reflective of building costs (including VAT) and also includes normal site works and site development. All-in cost includes cost of construction, land cost, professional fees, utility connections, site investigations/surveys, archaeology where appropriate, VAT and contribution to public art. Abnormal costs are excluded from these figures. </p><p>The table below outlines the current range of UCC values across all local authorities for houses and apartments: <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Construction - Range per Unit</th>       <th>All-in - Range per Unit</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 - Bed.

All-In Costs are reflective of the above construction costs with the addition of allowances for site purchase costs, design team fees, utilities, site investigations, surveys, local authority in-house fees, public art etc. as appropriate. With regard to the other (i.e. non-construction) items that make up the all-in total, the following should be noted: </p><p>- <b>Design/technical fees</b>: Design fees vary from project to project, depending on the location, size  and complexity of a scheme (and depending on whether design services are provided by a local authority in-house or via external appointment). As a guideline/indicator, design fee are generally expected to range between 7.5% - 12.5% of construction costs.</p><p>- <b>Land cost</b>:  Land costs will vary significantly from project to project, depending on location and ownership status (i.e. land costs could vary from existing local authority land at no cost to land purchased at market value).</p><p>- <b>Utilities</b>: Connection fees for Irish Water, ESB, gas, etc. As a guideline/indicator, utility connection costs are generally in the order of &euro;7k per unit.</p><p>- <b>Other Costs</b>: Other items that make up the all-in delivery cost can include site investigations/surveys, archaeological requirements, Percent for Art contributions  - and will vary from scheme to scheme. </p><p>The above data excludes Abnormal Costs, which are specific to the requirements of each scheme, for instance demolitions, service diversions, existing site conditions, access requirements. </p><p>Approved Housing Body (AHB) social housing delivery is primarily funded by the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) which is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units. This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. </p><p>In relation to affordable homes, it is not possible to provide a universally applicable cost of delivery of a quantum of affordable housing units. Such a costing is centrally dependent upon, and impacted by, a range of site and project specific characteristics. These factors include variables such as unit type, land cost, development and construction costs, costs and source of finance, together with ongoing maintenance and management fees, etc. In most cases affordable homes will be delivered via joint venture arrangements with the development sector with Exchequer funding covering an element of overall delivery cost. </p></reply>

As you will be aware from your own time with this portfolio; in December 2017, NPWS announced the expansion of Ballycroy National Park to include the area known as Wild Nephin. This expansion increased the total size of the Park to over 15,000 hectares of the Nephin Beg Mountain range, which included a private acquisition of 1,200 acres at Altnabrockey. This expansion of the National Park was the result of a long-standing collaborative project between Coillte and the NPWS, and consequently some 65% of state owned lands in the Park are now outside of the Ballycroy catchment area. </p>  <p>  Of the National Park's 15,000 hectares, circa 33% is in the parish of Ballycroy, 26% in the parish of Kiltane (Bangor Erris, Ballymunnelly, Bellacorick areas) and approximately 20% is in the parish of Burrishoole (Newport, Mulranny, Srahmore), and 20% in the parish of Crossmoline (Derra, Tubrid and Keenagh).  Included in the above is the 4,200 hectares leased from Coillte and the acquisition at Altnabrocky, all of which is not within the parish of Ballycroy.</p>  <p>  The new name is intended to assist the integration of the original park and the newly acquired land fully into the Nephin Beg mountain range in the North Mayo landscape, to integrate with all the communities in the townlands which make up the park and to provide a clearer indication of the location to tourists, reducing confusion, especially in terms of the Nephin Wilderness area. </p>  <p>  In this context, it should be noted that the official state-of-the-art visitors centre for the National Park remains in Ballycroy village, and my Department is currently developing proposals in conjunction with  Mayo County Council and Failte Ireland to upgrade and invest in this area, including examining the potential for a Planetarium and Observatory to complement the National Park&rsquo;s designation as a gold-tier Dark Sky park. The location of the Visitor facility in Ballycroy village and the associated walks and educational facilities, which attract  visitors to Ballycroy, will remain on all road signage in the region as we continue to grow the visitor numbers annually into both the parish of Ballycroy and the wider north Mayo region with the support of Mayo County Council.</p></reply>

This intensive effort across departments and agencies included the development of two Brexit Omnibus Acts; three Brexit Action Plans; substantial investment in the State&rsquo;s infrastructure and IT systems (including provision for 1,500 additional staff to support new checks and controls); and the provision of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses. Throughout the Brexit process, our readiness work was always underpinned by a strong communications and outreach programme.</p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the Customs Union and Single Market produced inevitable and unwelcome consequences for Ireland. Even with the Withdrawal Agreement and Trade and Cooperation Agreement in place, the seamless trade with the UK when we were both members of the Single Market cannot be replicated as was. The Government continues to do whatever it can to ease the burden on businesses trading with our nearest neighbour, including new requirements concerning customs and SPS checks and controls. While some businesses have experienced specific issues, more than 87% of the trucks landing in our ports from the UK are now being &ldquo;green routed&rdquo; to leave our ports directly, having correctly completed the required customs formalities prior to arriving.</p>  <p>  Government Departments, including my own, continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders, whether business representative groups, retailers and individual businesses or shipping companies, hauliers and logistics companies, to manage the issues arising from the new trading relationship with the UK. A range of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses remain available and we will continue to monitor developments and engage with all key stakeholders. Information on these supports is set out at gov.ie/brexit.</p>  <p>  With new UK checks scheduled to begin on 1 October, the Government&rsquo;s Brexit response communications are now primarily focused on exporters, particularly those moving food and other agri-products.  In addition to a nationwide advertising campaign across all platforms - print, radio and digital advertising - a number of webinars for exporters are taking place allowing Government Departments and Agencies to disseminate the relevant technical information to exporters.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, we note the UK statement of 6 September regarding the Protocol grace periods. We and our EU partners continue to engage with stakeholders across the island of Ireland, including in relation to the Protocol. The Protocol is designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to protect vital all-island supply chains, and to ensure the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. Just last week, Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic engaged with a range of stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including local businesses situated on the border. </p>  <p>  We remain confident that solutions do exist, within the parameters of the Protocol, for the issues that have arisen to date. The EU has time and again demonstrated a considered, credible, solution-driven approach to these issues. We will continue to encourage the UK Government to be similarly constructive in their approach.</p></reply>

Notably, we reassigned staff to the HSE for essential contact tracing; to the Department of Social Protection for the processing of essential PUP payments, and to support the Department of Health with quarantine issues.</p>  <p>  These emergency pandemic measures did not impact the provision of passports for essential reasons and we also continued to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, or where an applicant required the return of documents. As with many other areas of public service provision,  a backlog of applications has inevitably grown due to the COVID 19 disruptions of our normal processes.</p>  <p>  My Department is very concerned about this backlog situation and are actively planning to resume processing Foreign Birth Registration applications as soon as possible. We will be making a public announcement on specific dates in the coming weeks. My Department is committed to allocating further resources to this service to assist with the high volume of applications when regular processing resumes with a focus on reducing turnaround times to pre COVID-19 levels by the end of 2021.  In the medium term, changes to the FBR process to increase efficiencies and improve the customer experience will be delivered under the next phase of my Departments Passport Reform Programme.</p>  <p>  In cases of exceptional urgency applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly using email address: travelemergency@dfat.ie.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

It allows a predetermined number of vulnerable people in need of international protection to be granted refugee status in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Places on the programme have been allocated to approximately 330 Afghans nationals, over 70 of whom have travelled to Ireland.  Priority was given to those working on human rights issues, including the rights of women and girls, and minorities, as well as those working with NGOs and European and international organisations.  The operation of this programme is being led by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is, through our diplomatic network, liaising with relevant authorities in the region and countries in Europe in relation to transit routes. The Department of Justice is providing practical support by way of issuing humanitarian visas to facilitate travel to Ireland. That Department is also focused on processing applications for Afghan family members of Irish citizens and Afghan nationals living in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice is currently reviewing all international protection applications on hand from Afghan nationals with a view to expediting their progress, in line with updated advice provided by UNHCR in recent weeks. These applications are already prioritised, as agreed with UNHCR. The processing of these applications takes full account of whether a person will be in danger if not provided with a permission to remain here.</p>  <p>  In addition, I am aware that Minister Humphreys and Minister Browne have directed officials in their Department to examine, as a matter of urgency, proposals for a humanitarian admission programme whereby persons resident in Ireland could apply for family members in Afghanistan to be granted admission to Ireland. The introduction of any new scheme, which would be along similar lines to previous ones, would require a Government decision and I understand that they intend to bring proposals to Government in relation to this matter in the near future.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains fully engaged with the situation in Afghanistan at both EU and UN level.  As a Member of the Security Council we are working to address a range of issues, including focusing on the fulfilment of the Taliban commitment to allow the safe, secure, orderly and unhindered departure of foreign nationals and Afghans at-risk who wish to leave the country in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2593 (2021).  </p></reply>

As a result of well implemented safety protocols our staff were able to assist citizens who required passports for a range of emergency and urgent personal, business or legal reasons, or who had compelling humanitarian needs to travel. To assist with the wider State response to COVID-19, Passport Service personnel were also redeployed, at the request of different Departments, into other, essential public service roles, such as contact tracing for the HSE, assisting the Department of Social Protection to facilitate the processing of COVID-19 related benefits, providing consular assistance to Irish citizens overseas and assisting the Public Appointments Service.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service began scaling up to more normal operational levels on 4 May 2021, in line with the phased easing of restrictions set out in &ldquo;COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 &ndash; The Plan Ahead&rdquo; while continuing to operate the emergency service for priority cases for which customers are encouraged to contact our Customer Service Hub if they require assistance.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has received nearly 500,000 applications in 2021 to date, with approximately 110,000 under process. These applications comprise of 43,000 valid applications which are with the Passport Service and 67,000 incomplete applications that require action by the applicant.  </p>  <p>  The current turnaround times are </p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult renewals, </p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex renewals,;</p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time applications on Passport Online and </p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for Passport Express . </p>  <p>  These turnaround times for Passport Online applications begins when all required supporting documentation is received by the Passport Service.  For reasons of integrity, the Passport Service is not in a position to process applications that are incomplete as these are not valid applications.  Such applications will inevitably encounter longer processing times.</p>  <p>  First time applications for adults and children are complex applications involving measures to assure the true identity of the applicant, their entitlement to Irish citizenship and, in the case of children, that all guardians have consented to the issuing of the passport. Particular complexity relates to the process of application from children born in Ireland after 2004 due to the need to verify entitlement for Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times, including examining the processes around the verification and processing of the supporting documentation for first time applicants, and any delays that have been experienced by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high demand seen in recent months as international travel resumed. However, the Passport Service has a great deal of experience in dealing with peaks in demand is a strong basis for confidence, taking into account measures to ensure a safe workplace, that we will return to more normal turnaround times for the processing of first time applications soon.  </p>  <p>  In line with our continued scaling up of services My Department are actively planning for the opening of our Public Offices for the processing of urgent applications for those renewing their passport.  We will be making a public announcement on specific dates in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service will continue to review its processes in order to identify further efficiencies that can be made to improve the efficiency of our services and improve customer experience while continuing to protect the integrity of the Irish Passport.  </p></reply>

We have raised the issue of travel restrictions with the US Administration at the highest levels, both here in Dublin and through our Embassy in Washington D.C. Last month, the Taoiseach wrote directly to President Biden noting the disruptive impact that US travel restrictions have had, and sharing information about Ireland&rsquo;s successful and ongoing vaccination programme. I myself raised the question of resumption of travel between our two countries during my meeting with US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, in May this year.  </p>  <p>  I most recently spoke with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on 24 May, during which we discussed the importance of building the transatlantic relationship. I am intending to visit the US this month, and will continue to raise these issues during my engagements there.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Washington D.C. also continues to reach out to contacts in the US Administration and Department of State on the issue, emphasising the impact of the travel restrictions on citizens in both countries, as well as the economic repercussions. Our Ambassador in Washington is in regular contact with the US Administration urging them to ease the restrictions.</p>  <p>  At the EU level, there is also continued engagement and outreach with the US Administration regarding the ongoing US travel restrictions. Together with other EU countries, we have written to US Secretary of State Blinken requesting reconsideration of the US travel restrictions currently in place. Following the EU-US summit in June, a joint EU-US Experts&rsquo; Working Group to exchange information and expertise to reinstate safe and sustainable travel between the EU and the United States was set up, and has met twice since then. Due to the Common Travel Area, Ireland has also had a role in the UK-US working group. </p>  <p>  I know that the current situation is causing unprecedented disruptions and is placing enormous pressure on businesses, families and individuals. We continue our work to ensure that the restrictions will not have any long-term impact on existing channels of migration, business, tourism and exchange, which benefit our countries significantly.</p></reply>

The report contains some deeply concerning accounts of the explicit targeting of refugees returning to Syria.   </p>  <p>  Ireland believes, and has stated publicly on many occasions, that all returns to Syria must be safe, voluntary and dignified. Addressing the United Nations Security Council on 20 January, Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN stated that 'millions of Syrians remain as refugees, and the conditions necessary for them to return, in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner are far from being achieved&rsquo;. This clearly remains the position. </p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States recognise and are bound by the principle of non-refoulement, as enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Both Ireland and the EU regularly make that position clear and remind other States of their obligations.</p>  <p>  At the most recent meeting of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Executive Committee, in October 2020, the EU recognised the importance of safeguarding the principle of non-refoulement. In my address at the same meeting, I reiterated that defending the norms and commitments enshrined in the 1951 Geneva Conventions remains of paramount importance.</p>  <p>  At the UN Human Rights Council in July, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution which condemned the grave situation of human rights across Syria and demanded that the Syrian authorities meet their responsibility to protect the Syrian population and to respect and protect the human rights of all persons within its jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  Ireland's response to the Syria crisis has been its largest single response to any humanitarian emergency. Ireland has provided over &euro;190 million in humanitarian assistance since the start of the crisis, including &euro;23 million in 2021. A significant proportion of this funding is targeted towards supporting Syrian refugee populations in neighbouring countries. Ireland also supports refugees at the global level through core funding to the IOM and UNHCR.</p>  <p>  UN Security Council Resolution 2254 sets the framework for a comprehensive political solution to the Syria conflict, addressing the underlying causes of the conflict and of the refugee and internal displacement crisis. Ireland strongly supports UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen and I urge the Syrian government to engage fully and in good faith with his efforts to find a lasting political solution within the framework set out in Resolution 2254. </p></reply>

The 1956 Act provides, inter alia, that an individual born outside of Ireland can claim citizenship by Foreign Birth Registration, through a parent who was not born in Ireland but was an Irish citizen at the time of the individual's birth.</p><p>At present, there are just over 30,000 applications in the Foreign Births Registration  system that await processing. The number of applications that were received and processed in each of the years 2016 to 2020 and to date in 2021 is set out in tabular form below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Number of applications made online</th>       <th>Number of applications processed</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>14,000 </td>       <td>8,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>20,000 </td>       <td>18,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>25,000 </td>       <td>17,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>32,000 </td>       <td>18,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>17,000 </td>       <td>12,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (year to date)</td>       <td>9,000 </td>       <td>4,000 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Prior to COVID-19 turnaround time for Foreign Birth Registration was 12 to 18 months.  This was because of the very high volume of applications due to Brexit and the complex nature of Foreign Birth Registrations.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the current turnaround time is approximately 24 months.  </p><p>In order for an application to be processed successfully, comprehensive civil documentation must be provided to demonstrate the link between the applicant and the Irish citizen through whom they claim citizenship. On receipt of this documentation, the application is reviewed and checked for Foreign Birth Registration entitlement. Once entitlement is confirmed, the applicant&rsquo;s details are entered on the Foreign Births Register, and they are an Irish citizen as of that date.</p><p>The Passport Service will resume processing FBR applications as soon as possible. The Department is committed to allocating further resources to this service to assist with the high volume of applications when regular processing resumes with a focus on reducing turnaround times to pre COVID-19 levels by the end of 2021. </p><p>In the meantime, in cases of exceptional urgency applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly using the email address travelemergency@dfat.ie.</p></reply>

Reciprocally, many of our citizens have enjoyed similar experiences in New Zealand. </p>  <p>  During the pandemic, the primary concern in terms of the operation of the WHA scheme has been the health, welfare and wellbeing of those on working holidays abroad as well as current WHA holders presently in Ireland. Therefore the processing of Working Holiday applications by our Embassy in Wellington is temporarily suspended.  As well as health and safety concerns in Ireland, a key factor has been the ongoing travel restrictions that have impacted international travel to and from New Zealand. </p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Wellington continues to monitor the  evolving situation in New Zealand, in terms of a possible resumption of the WHA scheme, taking on board public health advice, possible easing of travel restrictions, job opportunities and the availability of short-term accommodation.  We look forward to re-opening to new applications from New Zealand when safe to do so and when circumstances allow so that young people can once again benefit from a working holiday here in Ireland and can fully experience and understand our way of life. </p></reply>

On occasion payments are made outside of the prescribed 30 days due to a number of operational reasons. There has been an increase in the number of these payments over the last 18 months primarily due to the operational challenges of remote working due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>Additional training has been provided to purchasing units and instances of late payments are monitored and queried on a regular basis. The Department has commenced a large payments reform project in 2021, which will lead to improved automation of the payments process. This automation will move payment processing to a fully online approval system. This new system will be conducive to earlier approval of invoices, earlier transmission of payment requests and ultimately quicker payments to suppliers.</p></reply>

This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  Central to the Defence Forces fleet of armoured vehicles are the MOWAG Piranha III Armoured Personnel Carriers. The Defence Forces currently has 80 such vehicles, which provide essential force protection for Defence Forces Personnel serving on peacekeeping missions overseas. The initial contract for the acquisition of Armoured Personnel Carriers saw the delivery of 40 vehicles in 2001 and 2002. Subsequent contracts saw vehicles delivered in 2004 (25 vehicles) and 2007 (15 vehicles), completing the fleet.  </p>  <p>  In December 2016 a contract was awarded to General Dynamics European Land Systems - MOWAG GmbH ("MOWAG"), the original equipment manufacturer, for the upgrade of all 80 vehicles. The scope of the upgrade programme includes, but is not limited to; replacement of the primary weapon system in the infantry variant vehicles, supply and integration of a Local Situation Awareness System enabling improved and safer navigation including night driving capabilities as well as improvements to force protection. Existing systems including mechanical elements are also undergoing maintenance and upgrade as required. </p>  <p>  The maintenance and upgrade programme is designed to ensure the viable operational lifetime of the fleet out to 2030 and beyond. To date over three quarters of the fleet have completed the programme with 54 vehicles returned, and a further eight due for delivery later this month. The programme is due for completion in 2023.  </p></reply>

In this particular case, the Minister is satisfied that the ODF had appropriately exercised his discretion, that a full, fair and objective investigation had been conducted by the ODF in relation to the facts of the complaints in this case.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that WRC rulings are in the public domain and will be also aware that the Adjudicator in his December 2020 ruling on two complaints brought by an individual, upheld one complaint on the grounds of gender discrimination in relation to promotion, owing to the treatment of absences in terms of access to promotion contrary to S.8 (1) of the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015.  However, the Adjudicator found that the Minister did not discriminate against the Complainant, and did not victimise her, within the meaning of S.2, S. 6(1) and S. 74 (2) of the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 as alleged in her second complaint. </p>  <p>  The directions of the ruling are currently being implemented by the military authorities with a view to ensuring that all of the training programmes and materials for Defence Forces personnel are fully aligned, and compatible with, the provisions of the relevant equality legislation and that follow-on actions will be progressed. A  Defence Forces Working Group is established comprising membership from the Defence Forces HR, Legal and Training &amp;amp; Education HQ Branches as well as representatives from the Defence Forces Formations.  The Working Group has had 12 plenary meetings to date in addition to meetings of sub-groups. Progress is continuing in line with the timelines set out in the ruling and this will be fully complied with.</p>  <p>  The complainant has ongoing active litigation in a number of fora, and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.</p></reply>

Unacceptable forms of behaviour are not tolerated in the Defence Forces and where there are allegations of offences having been committed, investigations will be initiated by the appropriate authorities. </p>  <p>  I  listened with concern to the women who recounted their experiences on the Women of Honour programme on RTE Radio on the 11 September 2021. I am committed to meeting with the women profiled, should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  Regular reports on such matters are sent to me formally from the Chief of Staff.   I have also received information on such matters by correspondence provided to me in a confidential manner by individuals who wished to have their identity protected.  It would be inappropriate for me to discuss individual cases, as it would be in relation to those cases which are within an independent adjudication process.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of some of the complaints profiled in that programme but not the specific details of all.  Senior officials have personally met and interacted with some of the people who were profiled on the programme, to facilitate them in bringing their complaints forward for investigation to the appropriate competent authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Concerning the Deputy's question on previous independent or external investigations, there have been three Reports from the Independent Monitoring Group (IMG) since the publication of the Report in 2002 of the External Advisory Committee on the Defence Forces &ndash; &ldquo;The challenge of a Workplace&rdquo;, in which matters related to bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual harassment were examined. </p>  <p>  Since 2002, reforms have been introduced and there are practices, and procedures in place within the Defence Forces set out in regulation and policy documents for addressing allegations of inappropriate behaviour, including sexual harassment, harassment and bullying. Trained Designated Contact Persons are available to provide confidential support services to personnel.  In addition, a range of other support services are available to personnel and their families, including the Personnel Support Service and Inspire 24/7 helpline. </p>  <p>  It is recognised however, that further work needs to be done. A number of specific actions have been in progress over the past few months with a view to shaping future reforms.</p>  <p>  Extensive discussions, which have been taking place in recent months on the establishment of an independent review, are at an advanced stage.   The purpose of this independent review is to examine current policies and procedures dealing with workplace issues such as dignity, bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and discrimination. I will be shortly making a statement on the matter, once the terms have  been reviewed in light of the programme.</p>  <p>  The Commission on Defence Forces established in December 2020, is due to report by end December 2021 and their views will also be an important aid to this independently chaired group.</p>  <p>  I wish to reiterate to the Deputy that any type of inappropriate behaviour is unacceptable and allegations relating to sexual offences are extremely serious.  Irrespective of when such matters of a criminal nature may have occurred, I remain of the view that they are best investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have the powers and expertise to do so. I would again therefore, strongly urge anyone who has been the victim of a sexual assault to contact the Gardai without delay and in addition, to seek professional help and guidance which is available from State agencies such as the HSE or from registered charities specialising in this area. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that both I, as Minister, and the Defence Organisation, are committed to providing a safe place of work for all employees. </p></reply>

Central to those rules and procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition through the e-tenders website and the Official Journal of the European Union, where appropriate, in line with the European Union procurement Directives, including the Directive 2009/81/EC on the award of contracts in the fields of defence and security. </p>  <p>  Details of tender competitions can be accessed on the Government's e-tenders website www.etenders.ie.  Tenders are published on an ongoing basis by my Department and the Defence Forces to meet the requirements set out in the Equipment Development Plan.</p></reply>

Unacceptable forms of behaviour are not tolerated in the Defence Forces and where there are allegations of offences having been committed, investigations will be initiated by the appropriate authorities. </p>  <p>  I  listened with concern to the women who recounted their experiences on the Women of Honour programme on RTE Radio on the 11 September 2021. I am committed to meeting with the women profiled, should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  Regular reports on such matters are sent to me formally from the Chief of Staff and I received information on such matters by correspondence provided to me in a confidential manner by individuals who wished to have their identity protected. I therefore have a statutory duty to comply with that wish. It would be inappropriate for me to discuss individual cases, as it would be in relation to those cases which are within an independent adjudication process.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of some of the complaints profiled in that programme but not the specific details of all.  Senior officials have personally met and interacted with some of the people who were profiled on the programme, to facilitate them in bringing their complaints forward for investigation to the appropriate competent authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that both I, as Minister, and the Defence Organisation, are committed to providing a safe place of work for all employees. This is done by putting in place processes and procedures developed with professional guidance and reflecting best practice. These processes and procedures educate personnel, facilitate formal and informal complaint procedures and provide support for those affected. The criminal prosecution of those responsible for serious offences also plays a part in highlighting the unacceptable nature of such behaviour and provides for due process and fair procedures. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that there have been three Reports from the Independent Monitoring Group (IMG) since the publication of the Report in 2002 of the External Advisory Committee on the Defence Forces &ndash; &ldquo;The challenge of a Workplace&rdquo;, in which matters related to bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual harassment were examined. </p>  <p>  Since 2002, reforms have been introduced and there are practices, and procedures in place within the Defence Forces set out in regulation and policy documents for addressing allegations of inappropriate behaviour, including sexual harassment, harassment and bullying. Trained Designated Contact Persons are available to provide confidential support services to personnel.  In addition, a range of other support services are available to personnel and their families, including the Personnel Support Service and Inspire 24/7 helpline. </p>  <p>  It is recognised however, that further work needs to be done. A number of specific actions have been in progress over the past few months with a view to shaping future reforms.</p>  <p>  Extensive discussions, which have been taking place in recent months on the establishment of an independent review, are at an advanced stage.   The purpose of this independent review is to examine current policies and procedures dealing with workplace issues such as dignity, bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and discrimination. I will be shortly making a statement on the matter, once the terms have  been reviewed in light of the programme.</p>  <p>  The Commission on Defence Forces established in December 2020, is due to report by end December 2021 and their views will also be an important aid to this independently chaired group.</p>  <p>  I wish to reiterate to the Deputy that any type of inappropriate behaviour is unacceptable and allegations relating to sexual offences are extremely serious.  Irrespective of when such matters of a criminal nature may have occurred, I remain of the view that they are best investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have the powers and expertise to do so. I would again strongly urge anyone who has been the victim of a sexual assault to contact the Gardai without delay and in addition, to seek professional help and guidance which is available from State agencies such as the HSE or from registered charities specialising in this area. </p></reply>

It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any pupils attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisation representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required, or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it, they should indemnify the school.</p>  <p>  My Department cannot direct any member of the Board of Management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment to pupils, action and procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses. </p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of pupils for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school, when appointing an SNA. </p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. </p></reply>

Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  </p>  <p>  NEPS understands dyslexia in the context the severity and persistence of an individual&rsquo;s needs over time and their response to intervention.  This approach aligns with the new Special Educational model in schools which focuses on the identification of need and the matching of specific interventions to that need.  Specific interventions are therefore tailored, by the school, to the individual&rsquo;s observed needs by the school, rather than being generic to a specific difficulty or disability. </p>  <p>  The Department also provides for special schools and special class placements where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.  Special classes attached to mainstream primary schools also support the needs of pupils with dyslexia.  Such classes have a reduced pupil/teacher ratio of 9:1 and an increased level of capitation grant.   </p>  <p>  Funding is available to schools under the assistive technology scheme for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. </p>  <p>  Schools apply to the NCSE, through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.  SENOs make recommendations to the Department where assistive technology is required, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Department's Circular 0010/2013.  </p>  <p>  Further resources provided for pupils with dyslexia include reasonable accommodations in State Examinations such as the provision of a reader, use of a tape recorder or scribe, or a spelling and grammar waiver; further details are available on the State Examinations Commission website at www.examinations.ie/schools/circulars/reasonable-accommodations/.  </p>  <p>  The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's present or future educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p><p>As part of this process, an offer on pay was outlined to F&oacute;rsa at an engagement at the WRC on 30th July but was rejected. F&oacute;rsa subsequently announced a day of industrial action on 15<sup>th</sup>September. </p><p>Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13<sup>th</sup>September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. The Department welcomes the deferral of the action scheduled for Wednesday 15th September to allow for intensive talks to resume aimed at resolving the claim and agreeing a final package.  </p><p>Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1<sup>st</sup>September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. </p><p>The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and an intensive engagement will take place over the next two/three weeks to allow this to be finalised.</p><p>The Department has offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.  This will take place via direct engagement with the unions in the coming weeks in addition to engagement on other elements of the claim and subject to all elements being agreed. </p><p>While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan in place for schools and DE, that intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p></reply>

Following consultation on the draft framework, the NCCA plans to publish the draft curriculum for mathematics (junior infants to sixth class) for consultation. The findings from this consultation together with the consultation on the draft framework will help to clarify the relationship and connections between the draft Primary Mathematics Curriculum (PMC) and the full redeveloped primary curriculum.</p>  <p>  In relation to the PMC from junior infants to second class a systematic review of the literature was conducted, concentrating on teaching and learning for children aged three to eight years. This comprised an international audit of mathematics curriculum policy (Burke, 2014); Research Report 17 (Dunphy et al., 2014) which focused on definitions, theories, development and progression in primary mathematics; and Research Report 18 (Dooley et al., 2014) which looked at pedagogy and learning more specifically. Drawing on this research base, a background paper and brief for development of the draft PMC (NCCA, 2016) was produced.  As part of this phase of the research and development of the draft PMC, the draft curriculum specification for junior infants to second class was published on the NCCA website in November 2017 for consultation. This consultation took place between October 2017 and March 2018. The report from this consultation (NCCA, 2018) added significantly to the research base.</p>  <p>  Following a decision that the draft PMC should be a single specification from junior infants to sixth class, the second phase of research reports served to complement the existing research base by focusing on the senior classes of primary school. A research addendum to Research Reports 17 and 18 was compiled (Dooley, 2019) which looked at broad teaching and learning considerations for children in the upper years of primary school. This was further supplemented with five short research papers which examined core mathematical concepts, skills and processes with which children engage across the five mathematical domains (Delaney, 2020; Leavy, 2020; Nic Mhuir&iacute;, 2020a, 2020b; Twohill, 2020). </p>  <p>  At post primary level, the new Junior Cycle Mathematics higher and ordinary level specifications were introduced for first years in September 2018, and were due to be examined for the first time in the Junior Cycle examinations  2021. However, due to the exceptional circumstances brought on due to the COVID-19 pandemic these examinations were cancelled. Each of the new Junior Cycle subject specifications will be subject to an early enactment review by the NCCA. In relation to Senior Cycle it is anticipated that consideration of the NCCA&rsquo;s Senior Cycle Review Advisory Report will give rise to further research in relation to curriculum and assessment.</p>  <p>  The development of any new curricula is funded through the budget provided by the Department to the NCCA annually as part of the Estimates process.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST)  and Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) as Department of Education funded support services have responsibility for delivering professional development supports to teachers and school leaders in all areas of curriculum and policy for schools. Both services provide Maths CPD to schools and teachers which takes cognisance of Department of Education policy, NCCA curriculum guidance and highly effective national and international practice related to pedagogy in Mathematics Education. </p></reply>

Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 and 2 schools.</p>  <p>  As part of the covid-19 supports provided under The Roadmap for the Full Return to School, specific funding was provided to support Principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools.  This funding provides each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week so that each school with a teaching principal has 37 Principal Release Days.   Schools have been advised that, in the context of COVID-19, the additional allocation of Principal Release Days outlined in Circular 45/2020, "COVID-19 Operational Supports for the Full Return to School" will remain in place for the 2021/22 school year.  The additional four release days allocated to schools with special classes, under Circular 19/2020, remains in place so that teaching principals of schools with a special class receive an allocation of 41 Principal Release Days.</p>  <p>  Based on the most recent figures, it would cost in excess of &euro;6.8 million to allocate an administrative principal to the 141 schools with special classes.  The staffing process at primary level for the 2021/22 school year is ongoing and the final number will not be known until the Autumn when the staffing process has been completed.</p></reply>

From January 2020 to March 2021 all published Prompt Payment returns for the Department of Education and D/FHERIS were reported under the Department of Education. This was due to the establishment of D/FHERIS during 2020 and the requirement for both Departments to use a common financial management system until the system was updated.

Members of development groups are nominated as representatives of their nominating bodies which comprise the key stakeholders and partners in education.

Importantly, they can also exercise their professional judgment in deciding which resources or textbooks, if any, will best support them in the classroom.</p><p>In relation to developments underway at primary level, the NCCA published the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework for consultation in February 2020.

This phase will open in late-October 2021 and remain open into early 2022. </p><p>The views of participants will be collected through open invitation focus groups, online questionnaires, written submissions and through working directly with school communities. </p><p>All information is shared widely through the NCCA&rsquo;s social media channels and on their website within the &lsquo;primary developments&rsquo; section - </p></reply>

When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan in place for schools and DE, that intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p></reply>

The group was originally established to consider contingency arrangements for the 2020 Leaving Certificate and was reconstituted for the purposes of planning for the 2021 Leaving Certificate. The group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p>  <p>  In meetings held in April and May, this group discussed the Leaving Certificate 2022 examinations. </p>  <p>  On 30 June, the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations received an update in relation to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. </p>  <p>  Following this meeting, I announced that adjustments would be made to the 2022 examinations which are similar to those published in December 2020 in respect of Leaving Certificate 2021. </p>  <p>  The adjustments are outlined in Assessment Arrangements for Junior and Leaving Certificate 2022, which is available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate. </p>  <p>  These adjustments will leave intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice for students in the examinations.</p>  <p>  The adjustments provide greater choice for candidates across a wide range of subjects.</p>  <p>  A summary advice note setting out the key curriculum and assessment arrangements for Leaving Certificate Applied Year 1 and Year 2 students in the 2021/22 school year has also been published and is also available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate. </p>  <p>  It is hoped that incoming sixth year students will be able to complete a full year of in-school tuition following their return to school for the 2021/22 school year, and will experience no further disruption to their learning as a result of Covid-19</p>  <p>  It was also announced, on 30 June that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.  The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.    The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice.

The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule which now stands at a new historical low will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.  </p>  <p>  As part of the  COVID-19 supports provided under The Roadmap for the Full Return to School in 2020, specific funding was provided to support Principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools.  This funding provided each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week.  Schools have been advised that, in the context of COVID-19, the additional allocation of Principal Release Days outlined in Circular 45/2020, "COVID-19 Operational Supports for the Full Return to School" will remain in place for the 2021/22 school year and each school with a teaching principal will have 37 Principal Release Days. </p>  <p>  In total 1700 additional leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools since the lifting of the moratorium on posts of responsibility in 2017, which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  The Department has committed to annually revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year which ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system. The most recent update for the current school year is available on the Department's website (Circular 0025/2021). This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  The Substitute Teacher Supply Panel was expanded last year, from a pilot scheme consisting of 6 base schools to 132 Substitute Teacher Supply Panels nationwide, with almost 380 newly appointed Supply Panel teachers employed, providing substitute cover to over 2,500 schools across the country.  Primary schools have been informed that the Supply Panel Scheme will continue for the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  I understand the need for improved capitation funding and I am pleased that Budget 2020 has been able to provide for a further 2.5% increase in standard capitation funding for primary schools that applied from the start of the 2020/21 school year. This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in Budget 2019.</p>  <p>  The combined increases given in 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration will be achieved. </p>  <p>  All schools have received the benefit of the capitation increases awarded to date. It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year:  </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year. </p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021. </p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in  the normal way. </p><p>- Priority consideration  will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support  for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received. </p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020  are available on the Departments website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

The programme aims to improve a person&rsquo;s opportunities to return to the labour market. Participation on CE is for a temporary fixed-term. </p>  <p>  CE placements are intended to be temporary and subject to time limits.  This is to ensure the continued availability of places on CE schemes for a broad range of  long term unemployed candidates. </p>  <p>  In general, all CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for 1 year. However, CE participants, working towards a major educational award, can seek to extend participation by up to two years to enable them to reach the required qualification standards.</p>  <p>  There is already additional flexibility as regards participation on CE for those aged 55 and over. For example, those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for up to three years, while CE participants who are aged over 55 and commenced on CE prior to the introduction of the changes in 2017 continue to be eligible to stay on CE for six consecutive years.  </p>  <p>  CE participants over the age of 62 are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS), subject to certain criteria    In total, 10% of CE placements are available under the service support stream and Department officials continue to  encourage take-up of this CE stream. </p>  <p>  CE participants&rsquo; contracts were extended during the course of the pandemic, which meant that many contracts extended well beyond the time limits mentioned above. As the economy re-opens and the public health restrictions unwind, these COVID-related contract extensions will start to be phased out from the end of October as CE schemes return to providing more standard supports to long term unemployed people and services to communities. </p>  <p>  I will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services while ensuring that places continue to be made available to those who are long term unemployed.</p></reply>

The revised estimated expenditure for the Jobseeker's Allowance scheme in 2021 is approximately &euro;1.64 billion.</p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation provides that where a person aged under 25 year of age claims Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Supplementary Welfare Allowance and is living with a parent or step-parent in the family home, an assessment is made of the yearly value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by that person by virtue of residing there.  The value of the benefit and privilege assessed is based on the level of the parents' assessable income.  Parental income is calculated as gross income less tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge, superannuation and union dues.  Rent or mortgage repayments are then disregarded, where appropriate, and, finally, a parental allowance of &euro;600 per week per couple plus &euro;30 per week in respect of each additional dependent children is also disregarded.  The balance is assessed at 34% and this constitutes the weekly value of benefit and privilege to the claimant.  This weekly value is deducted from the maximum personal rate applicable to determine the level of weekly entitlement.  Where the level of entitlement as calculated is at least &euro;1 per week and less than &euro;40 per week, a minimum rate of &euro;40 per week is payable.</p>  <p>  No assessment is made where a son or daughter and his or her spouse / civil partner / partner is living a parent or step-parent in the family home.  In addition, where a person returns to the parental home having lived independently for at least three years, the assessment in this case is &euro;7 per week. </p>  <p>  Jobseekers of any age who are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, regardless of the rate of payment including where there is an assessment of any benefit and privilege, and is unemployed for at least 6 months may be eligible for the Work Experience Programme.  Participants on the programme receive a weekly rate of &euro;306.</p>  <p>  Any change to the assessment of means for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and supplementary welfare allowance claimants who live in the parental home would have to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This brought the rate from &euro;9 to &euro;19 per week. </p>  <p>  To take account of increased costs arising as a result of increases to the carbon tax, the Fuel Allowance was increased by &euro;2 per week in Budget 2020 and a further &euro;3.50 per week in Budget 2021, raising the weekly rate of payment from &euro;22.50 in 2019 to &euro;28 currently. </p>  <p>  These measures mean that, while the general pension payment rate did not increase, a pensioner living alone could be &euro;15.50 per week better off during the fuel allowance season.  In addition, on a once-off basis in 2020, the fuel season was extended by four weeks, in recognition of the fact that many people were spending more time at home due to the Covid-19 lockdown. </p>  <p>  In considering options for the forthcoming Social Welfare Budget package, I will, once again, be guided by pre-Budget submissions from a range of advocacy groups, including those in the community and voluntary sector, and evidence-based research produced by organisations such as the CSO, the ERSI and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.</p></reply>

It also tackles issues of social inclusion and provides valuable services to local communities across the country.   </p>  <p>  In 2019, the Government established an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to explore how the Community Employment social inclusion strand should be best organised in the future.   I take it that this is the review to which the Deputy is referring.  The Group included representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Agriculture, Food and Marine; Rural and Community Development; Children and Youth Affairs; Justice and Equality; Health; Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Housing Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  The Group undertook a consultative process with a number of key stakeholders and community and voluntary organisations; all submissions received were considered as part of the review process.</p>  <p>  The final IDG report was provided to my Department for consideration at the start of 2020. Shortly after, the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic impacted on the immediate priorities for employment support schemes such as Community Employment.  With the re-opening of the economy and the phasing out of public health restrictions, these schemes are now returning to normal services levels, albeit in a changed labour market context. In this context my Department intends to progress the IDG Report in the near future. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Persons awarded this pension are obliged to notify the Department of any changes in their circumstances that may affect their pension entitlement.  A list of reportable changes of circumstance is included in the initial notification of pension award and in all subsequent review communications issued.  </p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation provides that the personal representative of a deceased person, who at any time received a means-tested payment, is obliged to give notice to the Department of their intention to distribute the deceased's estate and to provide a schedule of the assets of the estate.  The personal representative is requested not to distribute the estate until they receive formal clearance from the Department.

The means assessment reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of income or capital are in a position to use these resources to support themselves so that social welfare expenditure can be directed towards those who need it most.  </p>  <p>  A person may be entitled to Disability Allowance where they have an injury, disease or disability that has continued, or may be expected to continue, for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The Blind Pension is a means-tested payment paid to blind and visually impaired people.  It is unique in the social protection system as it is a payment provided to people with a specific physical impairment.  As such, it contains different eligibility and means assessment criteria to Disability Allowance.  Unlike Disability Allowance, recipients of Blind Pension may also qualify for a range of other primary schemes such as Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Illness Benefit, and One-Parent Family Payment. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I signed Regulations which introduced a new income disregard for Disability Allowance recipients who have been granted bursaries, stipends or scholarships towards completing a PhD.  It is subject to an annual limit of &euro;20,000 per annum (i.e. if a recipient gets more than one bursary, the combination cannot exceed &euro;20,000) and is available for a maximum of four years. </p>  <p>  My Department encourages other social welfare recipients to avail of education and training through the Back to Education scheme, as well as by referrals to Education and Training Board courses through the Department's Intreo service.  In addition, income received from the SUSI grant is disregarded in the means test for most social welfare schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are a number of scholarships, such as those awarded by certain charitable organisations, which are not assessed as part of the means test for social welfare payments.  These include payments under the 1916 Bursary Fund and under Higher Educational Scholarships for Adult Learners from Uversity to a maximum of &euro;7,000 per annum.  Uversity is a registered charity that has been awarding Higher Education Scholarships to adult learners since 2018.</p>  <p>  For both Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension, capital is assessed as part of the means test.  Capital assessed includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. Property personally used (a claimant&rsquo;s home) is not included in the means assessment. </p>  <p>  The Department uses an assessment formula, which is set out in legislation, to calculate a person's weekly means from capital.  For Blind Pension, and most other social assistance schemes, the formula is as follows; the first &euro;20,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand. </p>  <p>  The capital assessment formula applying to Disability Allowance is unique in the social welfare system, in that the first &euro;50,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the means test for Disability Allowance or the Blind Pension would need to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context. </p>  <p>  The issue of taxation of social welfare payments is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

Due to the emergency nature of these measures, it was not considered appropriate to conduct a Regulatory Impact Analysis in this case. </p>  <p>The Social Welfare Act 2020 gave legislative effect to a range of Social Welfare measures announced in the Budget on 13th October 2020.  A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not ordinarily undertaken on the package of tax, welfare and other measures announced in the annual Budget.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-15a.1235.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021091500091#WRW01000"><p>My Department provides a suite of income supports for those who are unable to work due to an illness or disability.  It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020.</p><p>Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.  It is payable for up to two years, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.</p><p>Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are &ldquo;permanently incapable of work&rdquo; because of illness or disability.  It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and medical conditions and is not means tested.</p><p>People in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (the latter for a minimum of 26 weeks) who wish to return to work are eligible to apply for Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) for a period if their capacity for work is reduced as a result of their medical condition. </p><p>Disability Allowance (DA) is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability who are aged between 16 and 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.</p><p>DA is structured to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or in insurable employment.  When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is also applied (disregarded), for the purpose of the means test. </p><p>My Department also provides a range of income supports for people who are unemployed.  The two main income supports for people who are unable to find full time employment are Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance.  Both schemes require that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work as well as satisfying the other qualifying conditions.  A person must be unemployed for 4 in 7 consecutive days to be eligible for a Jobseeker payment which means that a person can work part time and still be eligible for a payment as long as they satisfy the scheme conditions. </p><p>Jobseeker's Benefit is a social insurance contribution based income support for people who have sufficient contributions paid. It is paid for up to 9 months (or 234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid or up to 6 months (or 156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid. </p><p>Jobseeker's Allowance is a means-tested payment made to people who are unemployed and seeking full-time work, who do not qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit.  There is an earnings disregard of &euro;20 per day subject to a maximum of &euro;60 per week (3 days).  The balance is then assessed at 60%. </p><p>A person who is in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance for at least 390 days may be eligible to apply for the Part Time Job Incentive Scheme which allows a person to take up part time employment of up to 24 hours per week and receive a payment of &euro;128.60, with an increase for a qualified adult.  Participants on the scheme are expected to continue to seek full time employment and there is no limit on the employment income that they can earn under the scheme. </p><p>My Department also provides a number of income supports for low income families who are working, including those working part-time.  The Working Family Payment provides support for employees with families who have low earnings in relation to their family size.  The payment is provided tax-free and is paid weekly.  Once awarded, Working Family Payment is paid for 52 weeks at the same rate.</p><p>To qualify for payment of Working Family Payment, a person must be engaged in paid employment as an employee which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with him/her or is part of a family supported by him/her.  </p><p>A comprehensive set of income support payments are in place for those experiencing illness and disability, for those who are unemployed, or who work part-time, subject to conditions, and those who are working and have low incomes.  Therefore I do not intend to introduce a new welfare payment at this time.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

This follows a detailed review of public employment services in my Department, which included significant stakeholder engagement.</p>  <p>  During this extensive engagement, both at Ministerial and official level, all stakeholders were given the opportunity to share their views and suggestions on the Department's plans to procure quality employment services in an open and competitive manner. At my instruction, Departmental officials have met, again in recent days, with relevant stakeholders including the ILDN, non ILDN service providers and employee representatives.</p>  <p>  The focus throughout this procurement exercise is the customer, their needs and how they can be met through customer-centric services delivering the necessary supports in their journey to employment. It is vital that my Department has in place sufficient high quality employment service capacity across the State to meet customer needs as they arise and to be able to respond rapidly to changes in the labour market.</p>  <p>  The learnings from the phase 1 procurement, involving the procurement of a Regional Employment Service for four lots over seven counties in the Midlands and North-East, will be incorporated into phase 2 to ensure there are no barriers to the participation of the community and voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  The design of the request for tender for the Regional Employment Service, places significant value on an organisations ability to deliver a wide range of services locally through a range of other service providers and has been developed to ensure it is accessible to tenders from the community and voluntary sector, giving due regard to their experience and competencies.</p></reply>

CE participants, whose contracts were due to end during the periods of restrictions, have had their contracts extended for the duration of those restrictions on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  With the successful roll-out of the vaccine programme and in line with Government&rsquo;s ongoing plans for the full re-opening of the economy , my priority and the priority of the Department is to get all CE and T&uacute;s schemes back up and running fully,  providing work experience and training opportunities to long term unemployed participants while delivering vital services to local communities.</p>  <p>  Currently there are 11,000 CE and T&uacute;s participants benefitting from contract extensions which began in October 2020.   These contracts are all extended to the end of October next, at least.  After that date there  will be a planned, phased ending of CE participants' contracts, whose contract should have ordinarily ended between October 2020 and October 2021.  As this exercise will be phased over a number of months some contracts will continue for a further short period.</p>  <p>  There will also be short contract extensions for those CE and Tus participants whose contracts ordinarily are due to come to an end in the period from November 2021 until February 2022.  </p>  <p>  These final contract extensions will provide all CE participants with an opportunity to complete any outstanding training and to also benefit from further work experience on CE.  The coordinated and phased exit approach will also support the recruitment of new CE participants while ensuring the continued delivery of important local community services.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcome for participants, CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, including those whose employment has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 emergency.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to CE and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.</p></reply>

When there were two intakes per year for the two year ECCE programme children would get between 61 and 88 weeks of ECCE, depending on their birthday, which was not equitable.  The single entry point ensures that all children, regardless of their birthday, can have 76 weeks of ECCE.  No child has been excluded from being eligible for two years of ECCE due to the change to having one entry period per year.</p>  <p>  ECCE is not mandatory and some parents choose to enrol their children for one year of ECCE only, to delay their child starting pre-school until they are 3 and half, or to start them in school at the age of 4 rather than 5.  This decision is entirely at the discretion of the parent or guardian, but is not driven by the ECCE enrolment rules.</p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who take part in the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness, it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied evenly. </p></reply>

As a result of this, together with the additional places created under the Human Capital Initiative, 4,650 places have been created for 2021/22 across a wide range of courses which ensured that more students than ever before could be offered a place in a third level course.

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases.  The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course. </p><p>In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner:- </p><p>- Craft apprentices were prioritised for a return to on-site learning on 8 March 2021.  </p><p>- Delivery of off-the-job phases continued over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach assisted institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.</p><p>- &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This will facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand.  </p><p>- An additional &euro;12 million was allocated for 2021 to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures at higher education level (Phases 4 and 6).  </p><p>- A  three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is well developed. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time. </p><p>- Phase 2 apprentice commence off-the-job training throughout the year. SOLAS are engaging with the ETBs to maximise and expand provision to clear the waiting lists for phase 2 training. </p><p>- Phase 4 and 6 intakes are currently scheduled three time per year &ndash; September, January and April.  Additional capacity coming on stream at phase 4 and 6 from September has resulted with in the region of 2,500 phase 4 and 6 apprentices scheduled to commence off-the-job training in September, up from 2,100 per intake immediately pre-COVID.  </p><p>- In the event that Phase 4 and 6 are prevented from returning at full capacity, a number of alternatives remain available to ensure that craft apprentices are not precluded from qualifying in a timely manner, including the potential for competency assessments to allow apprenticesto qualify.  Any such measure would need to safeguard the integrity of the Craft Certificate qualification.</p><p>The SOLAS apprenticeship scheduling management system aims to call apprentices for their off-the-job training on a longest waiting basis on the day of scheduling. There is no facility to prioritise apprentices based on age, or any other factor.</p><p>Further updates will be published over the coming weeks on <i>www.apprenticeship.ie.</i></p></reply>

As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. </p><p>The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p><p>For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p><p>However, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p><p>Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.</p><p>An applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing <i>support@susi.ie</i>. </p><p>Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

This phase, taking place over the course of September and October, will see the majority of Covid-related restrictions gradually lifted and replaced by guidance, underpinned by a focus on public health advice, personal judgement and personal protective behaviours, to enable the wider reopening of Irish society.</p>  <p>  The plan represents a significant shift in the State&rsquo;s public health management of the pandemic and entails a change from protection at the population level, through regulations and restrictions, to protection at a personal level enabled by supportive measures implemented in relevant settings.</p>  <p>On 10 September 2021, my Department issued correspondence to English language education (ELE) stakeholders stating that this plan now provides a roadmap to reopening for all sectors of the economy including for the resumption of activity in the ELE sector initially from 20 September 2021 and incrementally expanding in line with the changes to restrictions following 22 October 2021. ELE providers have been advised that they should make necessary preparations for the safe resumption of activities in accordance with the provisions of this plan while ensuring compliance with public health guidelines alongside all relevant travel restrictions and advices as they evolve. This is noting, that the Government&rsquo;s roadmap does not currently address a plan for the lifting of current travel restrictions which will be kept under ongoing review.</p>  <p>  While, subject to the ongoing review of the public health situation, many regulations and restrictions will be lifted over this period, it remains incumbent on ELE providers to ensure that they maintain their duty of care for the health and wellbeing of their staff, their students and their wider communities as levels of activity increase in the coming weeks and months. It is key that efforts continue to be made to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 and that providers do not reopen nor expand their current levels of activity unless ready to do so in a safe manner. To this end, it is essential that all ELE providers: </p>  <p>  - Review and keep all sectoral reopening protocols, outbreak management procedures and the associated adaptation framework up to date and in line with evolving public health advice and the national Work Safely Protocols. This is to include relevant updates to arise from the signalled review of the Work Safely Protocols alongside the HSE&rsquo;s upcoming review of the public health response to Covid-19 which will address testing, contact tracing, outbreak management, surveillance and sequencing, </p>  <p>  - Continue to review on-site operations in line with the overall progression of disease control and mitigation measures through appropriate risk assessment and engagement, </p>  <p>  - Consult with staff and students on their wider reopening plans, </p>  <p>  - Ensure that all relevant protective measures, such as mask wearing and physical distancing, are in place and remain in alignment with evolving public health advice,   </p>  <p>  - Ensure that sufficient resources and capacity are in place to meet the needs of both existing and any prospective, new students, </p>  <p>  - Establish robust procedures for the safe arrival of new ELE students into the State, ensuring that relevant supports and information are in place to assist students to comply with travel restrictions and advices on arrival including where any restriction on movements or mandatory hotel quarantine is required,    </p>  <p>  - Promote and encourage vaccine uptake among existing, new and prospective students to the greatest extent possible,      </p>  <p>  - Ensure that all staff and students are aware of the locations of nearby facilities for PCR testing, are encouraged to get tested if displaying any symptoms of Covid-19, not to attend in person if displaying symptoms and to self-isolate in the event of a positive test, </p>  <p>  - Ensure that every effort is made to support and to comply with the needs of public health officials in the event of an onsite Covid outbreak. </p>  <p>  It is also important that the sector as a whole should continue to coordinate its efforts to collectively support its members to manage and ensure a safe and successful reopening.</p>  <p>  To facilitate the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s roadmap and the resumption of the recruitment of new International non-EU/EEA ELE students, my Department will be engaging with the Department of Justice to review the conditions which have been applied to the student immigration system including the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) over the period of the pandemic to date. Further guidance in relation to student immigration and ILEP requirements will be provided to the ELE sector once this engagement has been completed. </p>  <p>  In advance of the recruitment of new International non-EU/EEA students, ELE providers will be required to notify ILEP of their reopening plans and to confirm that they have the capacity and capability to safely reopen, to safely bring students into the State in accordance with relevant travel restrictions and advices, to safely provide for their full cohort of students and to fully comply with any and all relevant public health guidelines.</p></reply>

As a result of this, together with the additional places created under the Human Capital Initiative, 4,650 places have been created across a wide range of courses which ensured that more students than ever before could be offered a place in a third level course.</p>  <p>  However there are real, material limits on the number of places that can be created on courses with significant practical elements and placement requirements, such as dentistry. The places created already represent the limit of what can be accommodated in the system at the present time, and it is not intended to add further places this year.</p>  <p>  The CAO process applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the Higher Education Institutions.  Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. As such, neither I nor my Department have a role in the operation of the CAO. CAO points levels are not a qualification threshold but rather are determined by the grades received by students, the number of applicants for a course and the number of places available.</p>  <p>  I know how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, and I appreciate how disappointing it can be for a student not to receive an offer for their course of choice, but I would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. For those whose route into higher education may not be what they originally planned, there are many pathways available in the further and higher education system.</p></reply>

The Safe Return Plan can be accessed at the following link:  </p><p>The plan, which emerged following extensive discussions between university representatives, public health and other relevant stakeholders, provided a framework for higher education institutions to proceed with planning for a return to onsite campus learning that would be in line with public health guidance.</p><p>In that context, institutions and providers are currently progressing with their own detailed planning and work for a comprehensive return to on-site activity. At a minimum, on-site activity next year will include laboratory teaching and learning, classroom based teaching and learning, tutorials, workshops, smaller lectures, research, return to work-spaces and access to libraries with appropriate protective measures in place. As part of the safe return to on-site learning, other on campus non-educational activities and facilities such as sports, bars, canteens, clubs and societies will operate in line with prevailing general public health advice for those activities.</p><p>However higher education institutions are autonomous bodies, and the way in which the Plan will be implemented will vary from institution to institution. It is not for me to determine how individual institutions will carry out the return to on-site activity or to determine whether specific activities, such as graduation, will take place in person or on-line. I encourage students to to engage with TU Dublin directly on this matter, as the decision on how graduations will take place ultimately rests with them. However, I note other colleges have allowed in-person graduations to proceed in line with public health advice.</p></reply>

As the pandemic situation continues to improve and international travel once again becomes a feature of our lives it is important that people are able to travel here for short term purposes including to visit family, to study or for business reasons. </p>  <p>  The move to lift restrictions is in line with the next phase of the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic, Covid-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting.  </p>  <p>  My Department and I remain fully supportive of the current public health advice and all travellers arriving into Ireland must continue to comply fully with measures required by law including producing proof of vaccination, recovery from Covid-19 or a negative PCR test.</p></reply>

The fees are paid in parity with the fees paid by the DPP to prosecution counsel. This parity arrangement is provided for by the Criminal justice (Legal Aid) Amendments Regulations 1976 (S.I. No. 234 of 1976). There is no fee structure for paying defence counsel in the District Court as it is not the norm for a barrister to appear for a client in the District Court. On the rare occasion where the Court does direct a barrister to appear for a client in the District Court the fees payable are as set out for the solicitors in SI 234/1976.</p>  <p>  Fees paid to solicitors in the District Court are set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of Regulation S.I. No. 362/2011.

The project scope includes the construction of a new accommodation block for male prisoners, a new prison for female prisoners to replace the 19th century building, facilities to support rehabilitation programmes, a new kitchen, vehicle lock, visits / reception area, exercise yards and the construction of new offices for the Probation Service.</p>  <p>  The total estimated cost of the project is &euro;71.5 million and it is currently scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2022. I am informed that the Irish Prison Service expect it to be operational next summer, allowing for the commissioning of the various security systems. This timeframe is subject to no further restrictions on construction activity arising from the pandemic. The project is currently within profile and project budget.</p>  <p>  The consultancy firm referred to in question 43595/21 was appointed as technical advisor to assist the Irish Prison Service in procuring and managing the contract for the redevelopment of Limerick Prison. Four tenders were received in response to the tender competition and each bidder was provided with a comprehensive reply explaining the outcome of their tender having regard to the tender evaluation criteria. </p>  <p>  The tender evaluation report by its nature contains commercially sensitive and security information pertaining to each bid and I am informed that publication of this information could impact on the competitive nature of future tender competitions and the security of the new prison building.</p></reply>

The processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called &ldquo;legitimate interests&rdquo; ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR, with the case law of the European Court of Justice underlining the importance of free movement of personal data and establishing that Member States are not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has also advised my Department that section 30 of the 2018 Act appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1) (f), read alongside Recital (47). </p>  <p>  Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f). The commencement of section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has also confirmed that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest and that Article 6(1) (f) of the GDPR does not make the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing unlawful. </p>  <p>  The Commission also indicated that subject to Article 22 (automated decision-making), processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of profiling is not generally prohibited, albeit the processing must take into account that children merit specific protection as clarified in recital (38). </p>  <p>  Moreover, the Commission has indicated that the term "micro-targeting", as referenced in Section 30 of the Act, is not mentioned in the GDPR, as such its scope remains uncertain and undefined.</p>  <p>  Apart from this apparent conflict with the GDPR, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that section 30 gives rise to difficulties under Article 38.1 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 38.1 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In order for a domestic offence provision to comply with Article 38.1, it must be clear, precise and foreseeable in its application. It is not clear under section 30 what might constitute the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of micro-targeting. It is also a requirement under Article 7 of the Convention that offence provisions must be sufficiently clear and precise so as to enable individuals to ascertain which conduct constitutes a criminal offence and to foresee the consequences of engaging in such conduct. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are keeping this specific issue under review.</p></reply>

Minister Humphreys and I are acutely aware of the impact that anti-social  behaviour has on local communities and I am assured by the Garda  Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuing  to actively monitor crime trends and engage with local communities to help  reduce crime throughout the inner city. Any cases of assault or intimidation are completely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Preventing children getting involved in and diverting children away from criminality when they have already become involved is a  key priority for the Department of Justice, and both the Programme for Government and the Justice Plan 2021 contain a number of commitments with  regard to tackling anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I launched the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 earlier this year.  The immediate priority within the new Strategy is to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the State.</p>  <p>  GYDPs engage with young people through a range of supports, including education, training and  employment support, social enterprise initiatives, as well as personal  development and supports such as mentoring and personal development activities. Experience in the operation of the Children Act highlights the need to include children below the age of criminal responsibility (12 for  most offences) in preventative measures, and to consider the extension of  measures to divert young offenders away from the criminal justice system beyond the age of 18.</p>  <p>  In line with a commitment  in the Programme for Government, I have also established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour. This forum is considering the  effectiveness of existing legislation and will seek to propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, if required, and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that there has been an increase of 14% in the number of  Garda&iacute; assigned to the Dublin South Central Division between 2015 and August 2021, although it should be noted that issues such as anti-social behaviour cannot be solved by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, on 13 November 2020 Minister Helen McEntee announced that the  Department will pilot Local Community Safety Partnerships in three areas, including Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city. Local Community Safety Partnerships are the new structures described in the Department&rsquo;s Community Safety Policy which are designed to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community. The Partnerships will allow local communities to identify issues  of particular concern within their area and work with the relevant State services to develop a local Community Safety Plan to specifically tackle these issues. The pilots will run for the next two years ahead of a nationwide rollout to all local authority areas.</p></reply>

This is to ensure people working in prostitution can provide information to the Garda&iacute; on, for example, violence towards them by clients, without risking prosecution for selling sexual services. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the 1993 Act provides for the offence of failing to comply with the direction of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to leave a street or public place where the Garda has reasonable cause to suspect the person is loitering in order to solicit or importune another person or other persons for the purposes of prostitution.

This is a significant step in recognising and responding to the needs of victims of sex trafficking and those forced to provide sexual services. </p>  <p>  While it has not been an offence to sell sex in Ireland since 2017, for those who have succeeded in exiting prostitution, previous convictions can be a significant obstacle as they attempt to move on with their lives. </p>  <p>  The intention is that this proposed new expunging provision will be expressly limited to those convicted under section 7 or 8 of the Act of 1993 on the basis they were offering their services as a prostitute to another person. </p>  <p>  At the time Minister McEntee announced this initiative, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had identified 607 convictions to be expunged. </p>  <p>  This comprises 402 convictions recorded for soliciting or importuning for the purposes of prostitution, contrary to section 7 and 205 convictions for loitering for the purposes of prostitution &ndash; failing to comply with a direction of a Garda, contrary to Section 8.</p></reply>

Reforming and modernising our licensing law is an important part of how we do that. </p>  <p>  Today, I have received Government approval to draft the General Scheme of the Sale of Alcohol Bill 2021 to reform and modernise licensing laws in Ireland. We are delivering on the first stage of that commitment and setting a course for how we will do it.</p>  <p>  The outdated Licensing Acts, Registration of Clubs Acts, and the Public Dance Hall Act 1935, will all be repealed and replaced with updated and streamlined 21st century provisions relating to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises and registered clubs. This will radically reform, streamline and simplify our licensing laws.</p>  <p>  Separately, Minister Catherine Martin has today published the Report and recommendations of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce. I welcome the publication of the Report. The work of the Taskforce has included wide stakeholder engagement. Liquor licensing reform in general as well as Special Exemptions Orders was the subject of many submissions and presentations received by the Night-Time Economy Taskforce and has formed part of their deliberations.   </p>  <p>  The recommendation made by the Night-Time Economy Taskforce to review licence fees, including the Special Exemption Order fee, will be taken forward by my officials as part of the budgetary discussion. It will require further consideration in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Courts Service.</p>  <p>  Separate to this review and the fees applicable to Special Exemption Orders, and in acknowledgement of the Covid restrictions, on 21 July 2021, it was announced that the Government had approved a waiver of specified court fees and excise duties for vintners for the second consecutive year. On 29 August, Minister Humphreys signed the District Court (Fees) (Amendment) Order 2021 to give effect to what was approved by Government:</p>  <p>  - to waive court fees relating to the renewal of specified pubs and other liquor licences in 2021; and</p>  <p>  - to waive excise and stamp duties associated with those court fees for 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue have waived the excise duty on on-trade liquor licences renewals.</p>  <p>  These fees and excise duties have been waived again in 2021 to support vintners and other licensed premises. I know that the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on these businesses and Government is keen to support them in any way we can. The waiving of these fees and duties is an important signal of that support.</p>  <p>  Pubs, bars, nightclubs and restaurants are all benefitting from this measure, helping to stimulate economic activity and employment as the sector returns to activity in line with Government and public health recommendations.</p></reply>

Work on this Bill is currently ongoing in my Department. </p>  <p>  Minister McEntee and I met with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, in December last to discuss the issues of pet theft and animal welfare legislation. We all agreed to a collaborative approach to dealing with the issue. As you will be aware, Minister McConalogue's Department is the lead Department for all animal welfare issues.</p>  <p>  My Department is kept appraised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the issue of pet theft. </p>  <p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, the theft of an animal carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment on conviction. If the animal was taken from a person's property, the crime becomes burglary and attracts a potential maximum of up to 14 years imprisonment.  These are significant sentences by any measure.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act for the administration and management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including all operational policing decisions. This includes crime prevention initiatives and strategies. Neither I, nor the Minister, have a role in these independent functions and that is entirely correct. </p>  <p>  With regard to measures aimed at preventing such thefts, I am informed by the Garda authorities that information has been disseminated to the Crime Prevention Officers' Network countrywide specifically dealing with the topic of dog thefts. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety concurs with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe.</p>  <p>  Ongoing patrols throughout the country also act as a deterrent to mobile criminals and thereby help prevent criminal activity. Improved awareness of dog thefts among the community will ensure more vigilance within neighbourhood watch and community alert areas. </p></reply>

There are severe penalties in place for firearm offences under the Firearms Acts.</p>  <p>  A substantial review of firearms licensing, including consultation with the public, stakeholders and the relevant Oireachtas Committee, was undertaken in recent years. A number of measures identified as a result of this review are being progressed by my Department, including a ban on new licences for semi-automatic centre fire rifles. A recommendation to establish a Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority, which would determine, on the basis of an objective assessment of all the issues, with safety of the public being paramount, whether particular forms of firearms may be licensed in the State, whether there should be any limit on the number of such firearms and what safety conditions might properly be applied to their licensing, is currently under examination by my Department.</p>  <p>  The legislation regarding the regulation of firearm licensing continues to be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid-19 protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  The Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p>  <p>  I am committed to the development by the HSE of a well-governed and patient-centred health care service for adults and children in the transgender community, in line with the Programme for Government.  </p>  <p>  As the specific issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

This has been advised to GPs by the HSE. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in, having commenced last year, will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; conditions and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care.  </p>  <p>  The position remains that where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP. </p></reply>

The exam is in two parts, a written exam and an objective structured clinical examination to access the doctor's communication, interpretation and practical skills. These exams form an important part of the validation of qualifications and experience carried out by the Medical Council. They ensure that doctors applying for registration meet the required standards for registration in Ireland and are an important means of protecting patients.</p>  <p>  The PRES 3 exams are hosted by the medical schools on behalf of the Medical Council. Due to the pandemic, the PRES 3 exams scheduled to take place in  March 2020 were postponed and it has not been possible to reschedule the exams since. The Medical Council has had discussions with the medical schools to explore the possibility of running the PRES 3 exams but due to the pandemic and resulting public health restrictions, the medical schools did not feel they could safely host the exams for the Council.  The Council is in regular contact with the Medical Schools and the matter is being followed up as a matter of urgency so as to be able to offer the PRES at the earliest opportunity. It is envisaged that a date for the exams will be confirmed in the very near future.  </p></reply>

The EU Digital COVID Certificate regulation, and subsequent associated national regulations, do not provide for the issuing of a certificate for individuals who have not had a medical event as outlined. It should be noted that the percentage of people who cannot receive a COVID-19 vaccine for medical reasons is very small.</p>  <p>  The indoor dining regulations (SI 385/2021 as amended) provide for the use of the EU DCC (amongst other proofs ) to access indoor hospitality.  There is currently no provision for persons who cannot provide proof of vaccination or recovery ( apart from a minor accompanied by a parent / guardian or a person who is on site in a professional capacity) to access indoor hospitality premises.</p>  <p>  In terms of travel, it is important to note that the EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC) is not a requirement but rather a record of a medical event which can make international freedom of movement easier.  Regulations regarding travel to the State have been developed on the basis of public health advice in order to limit to the greatest extent possible and reasonable the importation of Covid-19.  In general, where a traveller is unable to provide evidence of vaccination for any reason, a negative ('not-detected') PCR test result from a test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival permits the traveller entry to the State.</p>  <p>  When a traveller has been in a designated state in the 14 days prior to arrival, there is an obligation to enter mandatory hotel quarantine unless the traveller is exempt.  The current set of exemptions is set out in SI 134 of 2021.  Travellers who have been vaccinated with an EMA-approved vaccine are currently exempted from the requirement to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine.  The states currently designated for the purposes of mandatory hotel quarantine are: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru.  The list of designated states is kept under constant review, and changes are announced publicly and published on www.gov.ie/quarantine.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that provision has been made for people who did not take up the offer of a second dose of AstraZeneca vaccine to be offered an mRNA vaccine in order to complete their vaccination schedule and a DCC is issued in such cases.  In this regard, the HSE has been advised to operationalise updated NIAC guidance in relation to the mixing of vaccines, specifically relating to certain people who are yet to complete a two-dose Covid-19 vaccine regimen.</p>  <p>  The NIAC advice on heterologous vaccination relates to:</p>  <p>  - those who are contraindicated from taking a second vaccine dose of a viral      vector vaccine (e.g. had a severe reaction to the first dose of Vaxzevira&reg; (AstraZeneca)) should be offered a second dose of an mRNA vaccine.</p>  <p>  - those who have already had the first dose of Vaxzevria&reg; and who did not complete      the vaccination schedule as recommended should be offered an mRNA second dose in line with their priority grouping or age cohort.</p>  <p>  The person would then be considered fully vaccinated after their second dose of an mRNA vaccine (7 days after Comirnaty&reg;, 14 days after Spikevax&reg;). </p></reply>

The conditions covered by the scheme are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In addition, where an applicant is over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Finally, persons may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-15a.1626.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021091500097#WRCC02400"><p>The Nursing Home Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as 'Fair Deal', is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021, which was signed into law on 22 July, introduced further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses. The principal amendment of this Act ensures that where the owners of farms and businesses go into long-term residential care, their contributions against those assets will be capped at 3 years, providing that a named family successor commits to running the asset for a period six years and certain other conditions are met. </p>  <p>  It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care. This addresses the first relevant commitment in the Housing for All Strategy (action 19.7). </p>  <p>  Within the NHSS, the asset value of a resident's home, known in the Scheme as the "principal residence", is assessed for 3 years, with 7.5% of its value going towards the cost of care (3.75% in the case of a couple). After 3 years on the scheme, the value of this property is no longer assessed. In practice, this generally reduces the nursing home fees of those maintaining their home, from year four onwards. However, under previous rules, if it was sold, the resulting cash asset was assessable in full for the entire length of stay in care. This could act as a disincentive for those who might otherwise consider selling their homes. The 2021 Act now extends the 3-year cap to cover the proceeds of sale, so that a person will be able to sell their home without incurring additional fees from the fourth year onwards. The timeline set out in the legislation ensures that the Act will be operational by the end of October 2021. In the development of the legislative amendment it was projected that this change would bring up to between 330 and 580 homes to market each year, on average 2.25 years earlier than if sold when the resident left care.</p>  <p>  As well as introducing the change above, the Department of Health has also agreed to action 19.8 in the Housing for All Strategy to develop a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties "in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people". It is important to note that complex policy questions remain in meeting these criteria and there are high risks associated with unintended consequences. There is no existing exemption of rental or similar income from assessment within the Scheme and due care needs to be taken to ensure that any changes are appropriate; to protect and meet the needs of residents while also making provision for those in need of housing. </p>  <p>  The NHSS is a complex &euro;1.4 billion Scheme that relies on &euro;350m of contributions from over 22,000 residents. It is important to ensure that the costs, benefits, and unintended consequences of any policy changes are fully understood and resolved before they are put in place. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and Department for Housing, Local Government and Heritage continue to collaborate on this policy, including the identification of the number of houses that may be brought into use and the costs associated with the policy options available to address this action, with a view to introducing legislation as soon possible once this analysis and policy development is complete.</p></reply>

The pandemic has demonstrated not only the value of the eHealth initiatives that were specified within the contract, but also others, such as the transfer of prescriptions electronically between the GP practice and community pharmacy and the use of telehealth solutions (audio and video) to enable social distancing and reduce physical contact between patients and clinical staff, during times when the virus was most prevalent.</p>  <p>  During the vaccination rollout, the HSE was able to accelerate the Individual Health Identifier (IHI) programme as a result of GPs providing the necessary identifying information for each person vaccinated within GP practices. This in turn will facilitate the practice systems themselves being populated with IHI numbers.</p>  <p>  It was not possible to implement the full ePrescribing system during the pandemic. However, my department did introduce new regulations which facilitated the deployment of a solution for the safe electronic transfer of prescriptions, thus eliminating the need for paper-based prescriptions and for patients to visit GPs solely to collect repeat prescriptions.</p>  <p>  Electronic referrals were used almost exclusively for Covid-19 tests. Whilst electronic referrals to NIMIS (National Integrated Medical Imaging System) could not be automated there was a general increase in the adoption of electronic referrals during this time, including through increased adoption of Healthlink, Healthmail and use of the PCRS electronic claims system by GPs before and since the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Whilst progress by the HSE on the summary and shared care record programme was impacted during the pandemic, GPs remained committed and engaged in preparations for their introduction. The extensive engagement by GPs in the Covid vaccination programme also involved the widespread implementation of the associated vaccination systems.</p></reply>

Ireland's COVID-19 vaccination programme will offer vaccination to all Irish residents for whom it is deemed safe, based on clinical expert guidance, and who wish to receive it.</p>  <p>  Ireland is participating in a Procurement Exercise being operated by the European Commission on behalf of Member States to procure suitable, safe and effective vaccines, in sufficient quantities, to combat COVID-19. Four vaccines have been authorised by the EU, and a number of vaccine candidates are still to be fully assessed. Ireland fully supports efforts by the international community, including as an EU Member State, to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all.</p>  <p>  To contribute towards this objective, Ireland will utilise the sharing mechanisms available through the EU procurement structure. It is expected that COVAX will be central to this sharing mechanism. With the continuing progress of the domestic vaccination program, greater clarity on the available quantities of vaccines doses and the initial timing that these can be shared with COVAX, is becoming apparent. The Department is in current liaison with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the European Commission and COVAX to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s participation, in concert with other Member States, happens in a timely and proportionate manner.</p></reply>

This provides for the permanent retention of 40 additional critical care beds which were funded temporarily in 2020 as part of the Covid response, including one bed in Letterkenny. It also provides for the opening of a further 26 beds in new build capacity in Limerick, the Mater and Tallaght hospitals. The HSE has advised that 41 in total of the additional beds are now open, bringing baseline capacity to 296 although the number of beds open on any given day fluctuates as a result of a variety of factors.</p>  <p>  The Plan is clinically led, and aligns with the hub-and-spoke model of care set out by the National Clinical Programme in Critical Care. It also addresses the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review in respect of critical care, and is fully in line with the vision set out in Sl&aacute;intecare of "right care, right place, right time".</p></reply>

Ireland has a culture of bottle feeding and, in order to improve child and maternal health, as well as reductions in childhood obesity and chronic diseases, we need to improve our breastfeeding rates.

I am assured by the HSE in the context of the closure of the Centre that the needs and preferences of each resident are of paramount importance.</p>  <p>  On 28 June, the HSE notified the Department of Health that the HSE&rsquo;s Cork Kerry Community Healthcare Organisation had taken the difficult decision to close the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton as the building is not fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  Owenacurra is a long-term residential centre with 19 residents but also accommodates a mental health day service.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission (MHC), as regulator, had raised serious concerns about the centre, and the HSE shares those concerns. HSE Estates confirmed that the building is in very poor condition, with major defects and is not fit for purpose. It was originally planned to refurbish the building but as work progressed on those plans it became clear that no matter what refurbishment takes place, the building could not meet either building or Commission standards. The HSE&rsquo;s priority is the welfare of the 19 residents of the centre.</p>  <p>  The relocation process is progressing. I have been informed by the HSE that all of the residents have had their needs assessed so that they can be appropriately placed in accordance with their assessed needs and I understand meetings with the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) to discuss options and the residents&rsquo; wishes (with family, where consent is provided) are ongoing. It is planned to complete the programme of meetings this week .</p>  <p>  The MDT continues to have ongoing discussions with all residents and a key contact lead is available as a facilitator for residents, families and the team. Social work input has been increased, including support from a housing co-ordinator, and increased consultant input is also available.</p>  <p>  A member from the independent Irish Advocacy Network (IAN) is part of the project steering group in addition to a Mental Health Service User Family Member &amp;amp; Carer Engagement representative, to ensure the residents and families continue to have independent supports available throughout the process.</p>  <p>  The process of engagement with the staff is also being progressed. Arrangements will be informed by the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreements &lsquo;Building Momentum (2021-2022)&rsquo; and underpinned by the nationally agreed Redeployment Protocol. The future of the entire site will be considered at a later stage.</p>  <p>  The HSE are reviewing what healthcare services are required in the Cork/Kerry area and if this site is suitable for the delivery of any of these services.</p>  <p>  A suspended mental health day service is also located within the building. Work is underway to identify an alternative location for this service, as close as possible to the current location.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE will continue to work with the MHC to ensure that quality and standards in our mental health facilities continue to be improved in line with best practice and recommendations.</p></reply>

Home support services are key in facilitating older people to remain at home and, with our ageing population, will become increasingly important in the future.  The Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.</p>  <p>  Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms and on 27 April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services.</p>  <p>  There will, of course, always be people whose needs are best met in a residential care setting and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented challenge across our health services and none more so than in our nursing homes.  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. The Expert Panel report, which was published in August 2020, has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.</p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders. The recommendations of the report are varied and complex, are both short-, medium- and longer-term in nature, and require a mix of ongoing operational response to COVID-19 and a longer-term strategic reform. Those strategic reforms are, by their nature, complex and relate to whole of system issues.</p>  <p>  At a broader level, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of this impact since the start of the pandemic, with various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons. The significant examination undertaken by the Expert Panel provides important learning and a framework for enhancing older persons services both in the short and long-term and this work is progressing.</p></reply>

The Department of Health is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support. It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. </p>  <p>  As part of this work, my department is examining the potential demand and cost of introducing such a scheme. Following this, work will be undertaken to examine the associated workforce requirements for the introduction of such a scheme and officials from the department will engage with relevant stakeholders from other sectors as required.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system operated by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages.  This objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work. The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit.</p>  <p>  The critical skills and ineligible occupation lists are reviewed twice a yearly in a process led by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. It is an evidence-based process that takes account of labour market conditions and submissions from sectors and other stakeholders together with contextual factors, including in the current context, COVID-19. The purpose of the system is to maximise the benefits of economic migration while minimising the risk of disrupting the Irish labour market.</p>  <p>  The review of the occupations list for 2021 is currently underway and officials from my department will engage in discussions with officials from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment in respect of submissions received relating to the health sector.  The public consultation phase of this review commenced on 1st July 2021 with a closing date for submissions of Thursday, 12th August 2021. The submissions received from the home care sector will be considered in the context of this review.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Strategic Plan for Critical Care, which was noted by Government in 2020, aims to increase capacity from the 2020 baseline of 255 critical care beds, to 446 over time, to fully address the Capacity Review&rsquo;s recommendations in regard to critical care. </font></p><p><font color="#201F1E">Very significant funding of &euro;52m was provided by Government in Budget 2021 to commence implementation of Phase 1 of the Plan. This provides for the permanent retention of 40 additional critical care beds which were funded temporarily in 2020 as part of the Covid response, and for the opening of a further 26 beds in new build capacity. The HSE has advised that 41 of these beds are now open, bringing baseline capacity to 296 although the number of beds open on any given day fluctuates as a result of a variety of factors. </font></p><p><font color="#201F1E">In relation to cost, the HSE has advised that the average annual cost of running a critical care bed is estimated to be in the region of &euro;750,000. It should be noted that this figure includes costs for both ICU and HDU beds, with ICU beds being the more costly. Capital costs associated with new critical care beds are estimated by the HSE at typically between &euro;1m and &euro;1.5m, including design, construction, equipping and all other associated capital costs. </font></p></reply>

The public health advice is to restore visiting to near normal in terms of frequency of visits in those settings with a high level of vaccination of residents as quickly as possible, while also recognising the need to remain cautious as we continue to deal with the evolving risks associated with COVID-19. </p><p>The guidance provides that: </p><p>- Providers should put in place the necessary measures to progress to more normalised visiting and visiting frequency as quickly as possible in line with public health guidance with no more than two visitors at any one time.</p><p>- Routine visiting will no longer need to be scheduled in advance.</p><p>- There is no requirement to have a list of nominated visitors.</p><p>- The duration of the visit should not be limited.</p><p>- Fewer restrictions will apply to residents going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home.</p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. In a broad sense, visits to nursing homes are governed by legislation under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013; regulation 11 provides that the nursing home should facilitate visiting and not restrict visiting except in circumstances such as the resident requesting same, or potential risk posed from visiting &ndash; this aligns with the risk assessments referred to in the visiting guidance.  The regulations also require that the nursing home has suitable facilities in place and available for residents to receive visits. It is the legal responsibility of each provider to assess the risks and mitigation measures associated with their service and how best to manage visits having regards to the specific circumstances that arise in relation to their service. The HPSC has developed public health guidance, mentioned above, to assist and support providers in this regard.</p><p>Notwithstanding the current positive epidemiological outlook and the continued reopening of society, risks continue to remain and emergent risks such as variants of concern present ongoing challenges and the need for vigilance. Visiting arrangements should continue to take account of general public health advice and the necessary infection prevention and control measures, to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities. This is particularly important in the context of the increasing prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant. This variant poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.</p><p>Visitors are reminded of their responsibilities with regard to self-checks for COVID-19 in advance of visits, infection and prevention control and social interaction with all individuals, while in the nursing home.</p><p>I have communicated with the nursing home sector to emphasise the need for service providers to follow the guidance and I have requested the issue of visits continues to be monitored by HIQA.</p><p>The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges.</p></reply>

Scientific and clinical evidence is evolving on the long-term effects of COVID-19. An increasing number of reports and studies are now being published on the topic; however, at present there is no agreement on the definition or the terminology.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that persistent and prolonged symptoms can occur after acute COVID-19 infection in a proportion of patients, including in some patients who did not develop symptoms severe enough to require hospitalisation. My Department, through the Health Research Board, continues to fund research into the clinical impacts of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate. People in the community who are concerned about persistent symptoms following Covid-19 should contact their GP in the first instance. Treatment is currently focused on management of specific symptoms.</p>  <p>  Specific guidance on the treatment of 'Long COVID' is presently under development both here and internationally.  You may wish to note that the HSE is currently recruiting for the position of an Implementation Lead to oversee the implementation of a national model of care.</p>  <p>  COVID-19 in children is usually asymptomatic or manifests as a mild illness of short duration. However, concerns have been raised regarding prolonged illness in some children, with no clear resolution of symptoms several weeks after onset, as is observed in some adults and this is an area of ongoing research. Studies to date have identified that that long illness duration after SARS-CoV-2 infection in school-aged children does occur but is uncommon and less commonly than is reported in adults. In most studies of children affected, symptoms are reported to have resolved or significantly decreased over time, providing reassurance about long-term outcomes. Additionally, studies suggest that the symptom burden in children with what has been termed long COVID-19 was not greater than that in children with long illnesses due to causes other than SARS-CoV-2 infection. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently assessing need and the best way to care for those impacted by Long COVID to ensure the appropriate supports are in place. As part of this work on post-COVID care, the HSE is examining how it can model the possible numbers that will be affected, noting that this will take time as more evidence emerges. I understand that the HSE has also been in touch with a group of people who are suffering post-COVID symptoms to inform understanding.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to develop an understanding of the implications of Long COVID to inform policy as appropriate.</p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The programme is based on the principles of safety, effectiveness and fairness, with the objective of reducing severe illness, hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19 infection.</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The Committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practices in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.</p>  <p>  The NIAC review all data relating to COVID-19 vaccines on a rolling basis. Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the NIAC develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. These guidelines are continuously updated and include guidance on all new vaccines as they are approved for use in Ireland.</p>  <p>  You can read the guidelines at www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/guidelines/covid19.pdf.</p>  <p>  On the 28th of May, the EMA recommended an extension of the use of the Pfizer vaccine to include those aged 12 to 15 years. The EMA subsequently advised an extension of indication for the Moderna vaccine to include use in children aged 12-17 years. The NIAC reviewed these findings and has recommended that vaccination be extended to those aged 12 -15 years, those in this age group will be offered an mRNA vaccination to protect themselves from COVID-19. There are currently no vaccines authorised for use for those aged under 12 years old.</p>  <p>  Clinical trials to assess the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in children under 12 years of age are currently ongoing, with results expected later this year. Vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna are conducting trials in healthy children between the ages of 6 months and 11 years old using lower vaccine doses. Children have different reactions to medications and vaccinations, so conducting clinical trials specific to that population is important to fully understand the benefits and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines in this group. Once the data becomes available, it will be thoroughly reviewed by the EMA and the NIAC prior to the vaccines being administered to children under age 12.</p>  <p>  Non-pharmaceutical interventions including social distancing, hand hygiene, good respiratory etiquette and ventilation, as well as vaccinating as many adults and adolescents as possible will all help lower case rates amongst younger children.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre-cyber-attack levels and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  Last year, in order to continue to provide access for patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was considerable growth and investment in virtual outpatient consultations by the HSE for many specialties across the system. While face-to-face consultations have resumed across the system, virtual consultations are still taking place where appropriate, reducing the footfall in hospitals while providing alternative access to outpatient consultations. </p>  <p>  The NTPF is working with the HSE and individual hospitals on funding initiatives to outsource outpatient appointments to private hospitals and to increase capacity within public hospitals through evening and weekend clinics.</p>  <p>  As part of the overall response to COVID-19, the Convention Centre Facility in City West was acquired by the HSE and a number of hospital groups including Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, Dublin Midlands and Ireland East have been using the facility for Outpatient and day case clinics across a range of specialties since September 2020.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p></reply>
