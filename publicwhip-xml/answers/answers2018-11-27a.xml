Costs incurred are expected to be significantly less than the spend on digital advertising in 2018 which is estimated at approximately &euro;450,000.</p>  <p>  The expenditure referenced relates to a number of major cross-Government public information campaigns that the Department funded centrally during 2018, for example Healthy Ireland, Global Ireland, Project Ireland 2040 the Self Employed Benefits campaign, aimed at ensuring self employed people are aware of the new and existing benefits available to them.The majority of this expense was incurred prior to July 2018, before changes were made. Public information campaigns in the future will largely be funded by the relevant line Department, as opposed to being funded centrally from this Department.</p>  <p>  Communications is ever-evolving. It is important to communicate across a variety of platforms, including social media, to ensure transparent and clarity for all citizens. The Government Information Service is now required to provide a 24/7 service to media organizations, on all topics of public interest, and with short response times. It is also required to generate its own online content, including written, audio and video material, as well as live broadcast on occasion.  </p></reply>

I also had the opportunity to meet the Chair of the Management Committee Mr William Moore and some of his colleagues.  </p>  <p>  I then visited Creggan Enterprises in the Rath M&oacute;r Centre in the Creggan where I spoke with local business people and members of the community. I also got the chance to meet those involved in projects operating from the Centre. During my visit,  I also met briefly with the local MP, Ms Elisha McCallion.</p>  <p>  Finally, that evening I spoke at the St Columb&rsquo;s College Annual Dinner which this year was in honour of one of St Columb&rsquo;s former students, Mr Mark Durkan. </p>  <p>  While my visit to Derry was short, it was a welcome opportunity for engagement with various groups from both sides of the community. I believe that visits like this by me and by other Government Ministers are important in the context of our overall North South relations, particularly at a time when the formal structures of the North South Ministerial Council are not active.</p></reply>

We both emphasised our commitment to avoiding a hard border and the need for a legally operable backstop.</p><p>The Prime Minister raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop. I indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop. </p><p>I recalled the prior commitments made that the backstop must apply &lsquo;unless and until&rsquo; alternative arrangements are agreed.</p><p>While I had no scheduled bilateral meeting with Prime Minister May at the Special Meeting of the European Council on November 25th, I did of course see her and my other European colleagues at the meeting. </p><p>I welcome the endorsement by the European Council of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, and approval of the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship.</p><p>The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland provides a guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. We hope that the backstop will never be used and we will continue to work closely with our EU partners during the negotiations on a future agreement that establishes alternative arrangements. </p></reply>

We also looked forward to Finland's upcoming Presidency of the Council of Ministers in the second half of 2019.</p><p>In meeting with President Niinist&ouml; issues raised included security and defence, external relations, including the EU's relations with Russia, an issue which is of particular concern in Finland. </p><p>In both my meetings we also discussed bilateral relations between Finland and Ireland, which are excellent, and agreed to continue work to further strengthen our strategic relationship.

That said, Brexit will have implications for each Government Department and Agency. Within my Department, staff across several divisions contribute to the work on Brexit. </p>  <p>  The International, European Union and Northern Ireland division covers work on all international, EU and British-Irish and Northern Ireland affairs within the Department, including Brexit matters. The Economic Division advises me on economic policy aimed at sustainable economic growth, with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness including the possible economic impacts of Brexit.</p>  <p>  To augment this work, my Department recently established a unit to work on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning. The unit assists a Secretaries General group, which oversees ongoing work on national Brexit preparedness and contingency planning. It is focussed on cross-Government co-ordination, planning and programme management, and works closely with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>  <p>  Preparation and planning for a range of Brexit scenarios, including contingency planning, was initiated well in advance of the UK referendum. Over the last 16 months, the T&aacute;naiste has led efforts to deepen and intensify this planning. </p>  <p>  The whole-of-Government response to Brexit is underpinned by a comprehensive set of Government structures, which ensure that all Departments and their agencies are engaging in detailed preparedness and contingency planning, including through the development of sectoral action plans.</p></reply>

The Council also discussed the current political situation in Northern Ireland and endorsed plans for a future programme of work for the Council&rsquo;s Digital Inclusion work sector.</p>  <p>  I had side meetings with Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in which we exchanged views on issues of mutual interest and continued co-operation. These  discussions focused mainly on Brexit and its impacts on business and citizens and on developments in Westminster and Brussels.  </p>  <p>  I also took the opportunity to speak with UK Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington on Brexit and on the absence of an agreement between the parties on re-establishing the Northern Ireland Executive.

Under the umbrella of Project Ireland 2040, Government has allocated capital funding behind the national priorities set out in the National Planning Framework. Hence, all stakeholders have clarity as to the linkage between the increasing capital resource envelope and national policy principles. </p><p>That national framework is being converted into coherent regional and local authority plans. This is where those national principles will be turned in practical actions, while applying the principles of the Public Spending Code to ensure that resources are directed to the purposes that will deliver the best outcomes for the citizen.</p><p>Under the NPF, the three Regional Assemblies are now responsible for co-ordinating, promoting and supporting the strategic planning and sustainable development of their regions, consistent with the objectives of the NPF, through the preparation of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES).  The strategy for the Northern and Western Region provides the opportunity for the priorities for Donegal, for example the priorities included in the existing County Development Plan, to be integrated into a regional investment plan which is expected to be a major driver of the implementation of the NPF.</p><p>I might also add that, as previously advised, my Department publishes a major capital projects tracker on the website of the Department, which sets out details of the key projects and programmes being implemented under the NDP, including the location of the projects where possible.  The Tracker includes a number of major projects directly related to Donegal.  The tracker currently focuses on projects and programmes with costs greater than &euro;20 million.  While it does not provide an exhaustive list of all capital expenditure, the list of projects serves to highlight the diverse range of infrastructural demands competing for the resources of the State.</p><p>Finally, I wish to reiterate the point I made at the outset, which is that responsibility for the management and delivery of the individual investment projects, within the allocations agreed under the NDP, rests with the individual sponsoring Department in each case.  My Department's role is to set the overall capital allocations for the Departments and to authorize the delegated sanction arrangements under which those Departments make their spending decisions.</p><p>The tracker can be found at the following URL:</p><p><i></i>. </p></reply>

This engagement has also included meetings between the Alliance, myself and my predecessor. Through that process of engagement, I believe that public service pensioners have had, and continue to be afforded, a meaningful and direct means of articulating their concerns in relation to pensions and related issues.  </p>  <p>  I would point out too that over the past number of years there have been notable pension improvements for many public service pensioners. </p>  <p>  First, pensions in payment are benefiting significantly from the substantial reversal of the cuts to public service pensions above specified thresholds which were originally imposed by way of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) under the FEMPI legislation.</p>  <p>  Second, as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 &ndash; 2020, the Government agreed a time-limited, conditions bound, return to the non-statutory, pay-linked method of pension adjustment which prevailed until the onset of the financial emergency. To that end, in January this year, my Department issued DPER Circular 02/2018 authorizing pension increases to qualifying public service pensions of the pay increases covering the 2018 to 2020 period under the PSSA, as legislated for in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that I and my Department are fully committed to maintaining the well-established dialogue with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants. Through ongoing recourse to that dialogue process, I believe that retired public servants and their representatives can be confident that their pension concerns will receive full and proper consideration as they have done in the past.</p></reply>

The &lsquo;Floods&rsquo; Directive also requires Member States to exchange information and coordinate in undertaking these steps in cross-border river basins.</p>  <p>  In 2009 the Office of Public Works and the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers of Northern Ireland agreed to establish a Cross-Border Coordination Group, supported by a Cross-Border Technical Coordination Group, to facilitate the exchange of information and coordination in the implementation of the Floods Directive. The Group has met on a number of occasions, and exchanged information and developed a strong awareness of and appreciation for the approaches to implementation to the Directive. The Group has also facilitated close liaison for the assessment of flood risk and planned measures to address that risk for those areas near to the border, for example Lifford in Co. Donegal and Strabane in Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In addition, representatives from the OPW have attended and participated in relevant meetings in Northern Ireland during the implementation of the Directive. Similarly, representatives from the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers have been members of the Steering Groups for the relevant Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Projects, and are also members of the National Floods Directive Coordination Group that is chaired by the OPW. This has further helped ensure coordination and exchange of information on a regular basis at the strategic and operational levels. </p>  <p>  More general cross-border coordination has also been ongoing in the field of flood risk management through bilateral meetings of the two organisations for many years, through the Irish National Hydrometric Working Group and Joint National Committee of the International Hydrological Programme and the International Commission for Irrigation and Drainage that the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers are members of. This continued close co-operation has provided the opportunity for co-operation in areas, such as flood forecasting and hydrometric monitoring.</p></reply>

The Central PPP Policy Unit in my Department endeavours to ensure that the information is as accurate as possible but any queries in relation to the details of specific projects should be confirmed directly with the State authorities responsible for those projects.</p>  <p>  I should inform the Deputy, however, that with reference to PPP projects in the water sector, since 1st January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels, and this includes taking on responsibility for the water related &lsquo;PPPs&rsquo; from the local authorities.  </p>  <p>  As water projects have been fully funded by the Exchequer they are already classified as on-balance sheet in General Government terms.  Such projects are not generally regarded as &lsquo;classic&rsquo; PPPs as they do not involve private finance and there are no contingent liabilities associated with them since there is no risk of a potential future GGB or GGD impact associated with such projects given that they are already on-balance sheet - unlike &lsquo;classic&rsquo; PPPs.  On this basis, we do not record these projects on the PPP.gov.ie website, nor do I propose to change that approach.  </p>  <p>  Details of the PPP projects in the water area would, however, be available from Irish Water.</p></reply>

This includes central guidance on the application of appraisal and evaluation methodologies including cost benefit analysis. This methodological guidance aims to enhance consistency across sectors through common approaches and the use of key technical parameter values needed for quantifying costs and conducting economic appraisals.</p>  <p>  Where construction projects are concerned, the optimum means of delivery and the long-term costs of the project are specifically addressed as part of the evaluation.  </p>  <p>  In reality the majority of construction projects are undertaken by private sector contractors engaged following a procurement process since it is neither practical nor cost effective for the State to employ a skilled workforce of the size necessary to directly deliver large sections of the NDP.  Indeed, even in that scenario, procurement of specialist expertise would still be necessary in certain circumstances.</p>  <p>  Where there is a requirement to procure contractors, all public works projects delivered under the exchequer-funded element of the NDP must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework which was developed to assist contracting authorities to meet their ongoing procurement requirements.  It provides an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review.</p>  <p>  The performance of the public works contracts was reviewed in 2014 and set out a number of recommendations including a range of interim amendments and the development of a medium term strategy for the procurement of public works projects.  The interim amendments have been adopted and engagement on the medium term strategy has commenced.  This will see a comprehensive review of the manner in which public works projects are procured and will focus on better delivery through public procurement.  It will not determine whether procurement is the optimum means of delivery for a contract as this responsibility remains with the contracting authority as part of the initial evaluation process.</p></reply>

Further to recent engagement with Leitrim County Council, the OPW and the County Council have also agreed to advance the implementation of the scheme for Carrick-on-Shannon.</p>  <p>  Capital Funding for the delivery of the existing schemes and the additional schemes identified in the Flood Risk Management has been provided by the Government and expenditure in this area will increase to &euro;100m annually by 2021.</p>  <p>  In January 2016, the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group was established by Government to support the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme and further enhance the on-going co-operation across all of the State agencies involved with the River Shannon, including ESB, Waterways Ireland, Bord na M&oacute;na, Inland Fisheries Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, OPW and the relevant local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Shannon Group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment, including targeted maintenance at a number of locations, trialling the lowering of the levels on Lough Allen, studies to explore managing flood risk at the Callows and lower Shannon below parteen.</p></reply>

The public interest would be badly served if entities of this nature were put at a disadvantage in their respective markets through being obliged to release classes of information that their privately owned competitors are not.  </p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the 2014 Act made companies such as Irish Rail, ESB Networks, Gas Networks Ireland, and Eirgrid which operate in a monopoly market or perform network functions subject to FOI in relation to their relevant activities.</p>  <p>  These examples illustrate the approach taken in the 2014 Act, whereby even where unassailable policy or legal arguments for the exclusions of certain elements or activities of particular entities, every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that these entities are subject to FOI to the greatest extent possible.  The exclusions were carefully crafted so as to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the public interest by providing for exclusions where neccessary, but furthering openness, transparency and accountability wherever possible.</p>  <p>  Given the relatively short period of time that has elapsed since the introduction of the 2014 Act, I do not believe that the background facts underpinning the rationales behind the relevant exclusions has changed to any significant extent, and I therefore do not believe that there is any necessity to review these provisions at this time.</p></reply>

To this end, the expenditure strategy for Budget 2019 is based on providing steady increases in public expenditure, which are underpinned by stable and predictable tax measures.  This requires a focus on affordable and sustainable improvements in services as well as effective prioritisation in the allocation of resources to deliver on key policy objectives. </p>  <p>  Since 2015, Government has been in a position to provide for increases in expenditure each year. While these increases have impacted broadly across all sectors, a particular emphasis has been placed on key sectoral areas of Health, Housing, Education and Social Protection which support our social goal of moving towards a fairer and more inclusive society.</p>  <p>  Of course, as we increase expenditure we must also strengthen our focus on managing resources in a prudent and efficient manner. This is a key responsibility of each Government Minister and Department. Officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are in regular contact with all Government Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is reporting to Government each month on expenditure levels. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against published expenditure profiles and this information is published each month with the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  Responsible spending means we must also prioritise spending that mitigates risk, enhances the resilience of the economy and raises our growth capacity. In this context, the Government has set out its vision for Ireland over the medium term through the publication of Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan.  This plan sets out a roadmap for increasing investment levels in Ireland in a sustainable manner and delivering modern public infrastructure over the coming years. This will further our social and economic goals by improving the lives of people throughout Ireland and allowing our companies and economy to continue to compete in a globalised world.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is also important that we continue to reform and enhance the way public services are delivered. This can be achieved by applying management accountability, raising efficiency, technological progress and other means. By better aligning inputs with outputs, we can ensure better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money and improve the efficiency with which these monies are allocated.  A number of initiatives are in place in my Department and across the system that aim to do this, such as Performance Budgeting, Equality Budgeting, the Spending Review process and Social Impact Assessments.</p></reply>

I am advised that this approach did not yield any viable proposals.</p>  <p>  Having taken into consideration the advice of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, my officials have been left with no alternative but to formally withdraw from proceeding with the proposed sales. On the 1st November 2018 the Chief State Solicitor's Office wrote to the legal representatives of the occupiers advising them accordingly.

By the end of 2017 (the latest date for which figures are available), the Department had reduced its energy consumption by 25%.</p>  <p>  The energy consumption reduction achieved to date is as a consequence of participating in a number of programmes. My Department participates in the SEAI Public Sector Energy Efficiency Programme and engages in the Optimising Power @ Work campaign under the auspices of the OPW.  In line with the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy 2017 an Energy Performance Officer has been appointed, at Assistant Secretary level, to provide leadership and accountability in reaching the NEEAP targets. Efforts towards improving energy efficiency have been achieved through proactive departmental energy teams who are, since 2007, implementing energy efficiency initiatives such as using only energy-efficient lighting, more strict control of heating and ventilation systems, organising Energy Awareness Days to improve behaviour by staff at desk level, installing timers on high energy units, regular energy audits and monitoring and reporting etc.  It's also worth noting that since 2010 the Department HQ uses a renewable resource, wood pellets, as its main heating system rather than depending on fossil fuels. To date the efforts of our energy teams have been recognised by the OPW under the Optimising Power @ Work campaign with the receipt of numerous awards, including most recently 2018 Regional Best Energy Team and 2018 Regional winners of the Outstanding Achievement Category.</p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to make every effort and will continue to strive to be more energy-efficient to reach the ambitious 2020 target by continuing to implement existing initiatives in a proactive approach in order to improve energy efficiency. In addition its energy teams will continue to meet on a regular basis to devise and implement new energy saving initiatives in order to reach climate change targets.</p></reply>

The Common Travel Area is a long-standing arrangement between the UK and Ireland which means Irish citizens can move freely to live, work, and study in the UK on the same basis as UK citizens and vice versa.  It provides for associated rights and entitlements including access to employment, healthcare, education, and social benefits, as well as the right to vote in certain elections.  It is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and the continuation of this arrangement is a stated objective of both the Irish and UK Governments.  The maintenance of the CTA is a bilateral matter.  Work is ongoing both with the UK and domestically at official level to ensure that the necessary provisions are made in both jurisdictions so that the CTA continues to function effectively after the UK leaves the EU.</p>  <p>  Ensuring the access of those entitled to Irish citizenship in Northern Ireland to specific EU programmes, such as in the areas of healthcare and education, will be addressed as appropriate during the period of transition and in the context of the future relationship.  This is reflected in the preamble of the Protocol.</p>  <p>  The transition period that is provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement will ensure no change in terms of access to EU programmes such as EHIC and Erasmus out to December 2020 and possibly for up to a further 1 to 2 years if the EU and UK decide to extend transition.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on the UK government to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and it should ensure that these issues, including possible future UK participation in EU funds and programmes, are part of its detailed position and pursued in the discussions on the EU-UK future relationship.  There have been some indications in the UK White Paper in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the UK that was agreed on 25 November also includes some important references to cooperation between the Union and the UK in relevant areas.</p>  <p>  The Political Declaration in addition affirms the commitment of the Union and the UK that the Good Friday Agreement &ldquo;must be protected in all its parts, and that this extends to the practical application of the 1998 Agreement on the island of Ireland and to the totality of the relationships set out in the 1998 Agreement&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to proactively engage to ensure that people in Northern Ireland continue to enjoy access to EU rights, opportunities, and benefits into the future.</p></reply>

It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island, to mutual benefit.</p><p>The Government is therefore firmly focused on protecting the full range of areas in which North South cooperation exists today.<font color="#004080">  </font>This is fully reflected in the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union which was endorsed by the European Council on 25 November 2018.</p><p>In the context of the negotiations between the EU and the UK which led to this agreement and at the request of the EU and UK Coordinators for the High Level Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland, officials carried out detailed work over October and November 2017 to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies.</p><p>This included looking at the six North South implementation bodies, the areas of cooperation under the North South Ministerial Council, which cover agriculture, environment, health, education, transport and tourism, as well as other areas where there is practical cooperation between North and South, including justice and security, energy, broadcasting and communications, inland fisheries, sport and culture.</p><p>The exercise overall highlighted how the maintenance and future development of meaningful North South cooperation relies on the EU legal and policy frameworks to give direction to this cooperation and to facilitate its operation.  The EU frameworks are both overarching and the foundation to North South cooperation in many instances.  Much of the cooperation is interconnected, mutually supporting and complementary.</p><p>The Joint Report agreed by the EU and UK negotiators on 8 December 2017 acknowledged that cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement, and that the UK departure from the Union gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South cooperation.  The UK has accordingly committed to protecting and supporting continued North-South cooperation across the full range of contexts and frameworks of cooperation, including the continued operation of the North-South implementation bodies.  This is reflected in Article 13 of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland to the Withdrawal Agreement.</p><p>As the mapping exercise was conducted by the EU and UK in the course of their dialogue on Ireland and Northern Ireland, joint publication of a final report is ultimately a matter for the EU and UK.  However, once the Withdrawal Agreement has been endorsed by all parties,<font color="#004080"> </font>the Government would see no reason why the report should not be published in due course<font color="#004080">.</font></p></reply>

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.</p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most.  More than 400,000 people have died and an estimated 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition.  While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay.  Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan.  On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis.  The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation.  Our Ambassador plans to visit again this week.</p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.</p>  <p>  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan.  Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.</p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.</p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.</p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

Having participated at each event, I am pleased to confirm that all workshops attracted a strong attendance with over 2000 businesses attending to date. The Workshops also attracted significant domestic and international (in particular UK) media coverage which afforded an opportunity to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s overall approach and specific concerns in relation to Brexit. </p><p>The positive impact of the roadshows is reflected in an increase in interactions with the Brexit supports offered by State agencies. For example, Enterprise Ireland has recorded a 92% increase in Brexit Scorecard completions from September to October, as well as a 62% increase in interactions on its website. Similarly, F&aacute;ilte Ireland noted a 24% increase in views to their Brexit webpages subsequent to the October events, as well as an uptrend averaging 83% in the number of interactions on their Get Brexit Ready diagnostic tool.</p><p>In organising each workshop, every effort has been made to ensure that costs are kept to the necessary minimum, and that they reflect the best value for money. Costs that have arisen directly so far in connection with the workshop events and for which invoices / confirmed costings have been received are as follows: <table><tr><th>Item</th><th>Totals</th></tr><tr><td>Venue Hire, Catering &amp;amp; Related</td><td>&euro;54,848.09</td></tr><tr><td>Event Staging / Audio-Visual Equipment (OPW)</td><td>&euro;35,420.93</td></tr><tr><td>Event Materials / Signage</td><td>&euro;5,304.33</td></tr><tr><td>Badging / Registration</td><td>&euro;1,702.77</td></tr><tr><td>Photography</td><td>&euro;2,091</td></tr><tr><td>Moderator</td><td>&euro;1409.47</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;100,776.59</td></tr></table></p><p>One further Getting Ireland Brexit Ready workshop event will take place in Letterkenny, Donegal on 30 November. I am confident that this will likewise be in high demand and that attendees will gain many useful insights and practical advice on steps which they and their businesses can take to help prepare for the impact of Brexit. Other Brexit preparedness-related public information activities and events continue to be organised by State Agencies and Departments across Ireland and relevant details on these can be found at the new dedicated Brexit events page on the dfa.ie/brexit website.</p><p>My Department engages in advertising and public awareness campaigns where there is important information that needs to be brought to the attention of citizens. </p><p>A public information campaign to promote awareness of Government-wide supports and resources that are available to assist with Brexit preparedness is one such example of this. </p><p>As detailed above, my Department is coordinating a Government-wide &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready Campaign&rsquo; which I and Ministers Humphreys and Creed launched together on 20 September. This campaign has updated citizens, communities and businesses about Brexit preparedness and support measures that are available as well as public workshop events which are being held throughout October and November. A programme of awareness raising via web and social media platforms and radio and print media advertising also took place.  </p><p>The Government Brexit Update email service and the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign forms part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to keep the Irish public fully informed and up-to date on the implications and challenges of Brexit. </p><p>The Update is issuing on a regular basis via a commercial provider and provides information on latest developments in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, on the latest available research publications and on engagement at Government level. It also highlights the range of business supports that are available through the various Government Departments and State agencies. </p><p>Advertising costs that have arisen directly so far in connection with the &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; campaign and for which invoices / confirmed costings have been received are as follows: <table><tr><th>Item</th><th>Totals (to date)</th></tr><tr><td>PhD Media/TBWA</td><td>&euro;28,948.10</td></tr><tr><td>GIBR 5 Part Podcast Series</td><td>&euro;1845</td></tr><tr><td>Government Brexit Update</td><td>&euro;1,280.08</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;32,073.18</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Officials in my Department in Dublin, at our Embassy in Bras&iacute;lia, and at our Consulate-General in S&atilde;o Paulo, followed the election process closely and have continued to monitor political developments since, including announcements made by the President-elect, members of his transition team and of the incoming government. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the full plan for the new government will not be clear until after President-elect Bolsonaro assumes office on 1 January 2019. The President-elect is currently in the process of appointing ministers, but the overall shape of the incoming government is yet to be finalised. While we have taken note of statements made by the President-elect and Ministers-designate, this is a period of transition and it will be some time before official government policy becomes apparent.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a committed supporter of global efforts to combat climate change, one of the most serious threats facing the world today, and Brazil has been an important partner on this issue. Brazil played a key role in the formation of the Paris Agreement of 2015, and I was pleased to see indications from President-elect Bolsonaro that he plans to keep Brazil in the agreement. Ireland will continue to engage with Brazil, and other partners in the Latin America and Caribbean region, on the issue of climate change and sustainable development, through our bilateral, EU level and EU-CELAC relationships.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the EU-Mercosur trade deal, as the Deputy will appreciate, the negotiation of trade agreements is an EU competency. Ireland remains supportive of the EU approach to the Mercosur trade negotiations, and is hopeful of reaching a conclusion on a balanced and ambitious deal. </p>  <p>  The relationship between Brazil and Ireland is longstanding and warm. Brazil is an important partner of Ireland in a number of areas, including on multilateral issues, such as disarmament and non-proliferation, and is our second largest trading partner in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Brazilians are the sixth largest non-Irish group in our population, with nearly 16,000 Brazilians living in Ireland in 2016. </p>  <p>  I look forward to building and strengthening our relationship with Brazil in the years to come  .</p></reply>

This includes over &euro;4 million in 2018 principally channelled through the UN&rsquo;s Yemen Humanitarian Fund - Ireland is one of the top ten donors to the Fund, which provides essential humanitarian services to millions of people in need.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is also a significant contributor to multilateral funds that allocate funding to the Yemen Crisis, notably the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland has been one of the strongest supporters of CERF since its inception in 2006. So far in 2018, the CERF has allocated $50 million to the humanitarian response in Yemen. </p>  <p>  Ireland also contributes support to Yemen via the EU. Since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the EU has allocated over &euro;438 million to support humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  Like so many humanitarian crises around the world, the tragedy unfolding in Yemen has its roots in conflict. Ireland, directly and through the EU and the UN, continues to call for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, and calls on all parties to facilitate safe and secure access for humanitarian actors. </p>  <p>  Should the public wish to assist those in need in Yemen, there are very capable aid agencies with presence in Ireland who would welcome contributions.</p></reply>

The principle that medical practitioners must be allowed to practice free of any political interference is one that must be respected in any democratic country, and particularly in an EU Candidate and key partner country such as Turkey.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, the Irish Government, together with the European Union, continues to view the backsliding in Turkey with regard to freedom of media, human rights, rule of law and democracy as an ongoing cause for grave concern. This was reflected in the Conclusions on Enlargement adopted on 26 June last at the General Affairs Council, which found that Turkey has been moving away from the EU and that accession negotiations have, therefore, come to a standstill. Concerns were expressed, including by Ireland, about backsliding on the rule of law and fundamental rights and measures targeting journalists, academics, members of political parties, parliamentarians, human rights defenders, social media users, and others exercising their fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>  <p>  While it is to be welcomed that in July the Turkish Government chose not to renew the State of Emergency that had been in place in the country, we echo the EU&rsquo;s statement that the retention of a number of the State of Emergency&rsquo;s restrictive measures may dampen any potential benefits brought about by its removal. Together with our European partners, and particularly following this non-renewal, we will continue to monitor government actions that undermine freedom of expression, democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights in Turkey.</p></reply>

The conflict was sparked, more than seven years ago, by brutal repression of dissent by the Assad regime. The conduct of the conflict, including the use of chemical weapons and medieval &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; tactics, is estimated to have cost the lives of over 400,000 people. It has led to a situation in which 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.</p>  <p>  Sanctions are a tool which the international community may use to put political pressure on those who commit violence against their own people. Targeted EU sanctions are in place against people and entities that are complicit in the violent repression of the civilian population in Syria. The first person on this EU list is Bashar Al Assad, whose brutal pursuit of this conflict, neglecting all opportunities to seek a political solution, has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. There are numerous barriers to humanitarian access in Syria as a result of actions by the parties to the conflict, particularly the Assad regime. </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the Assad regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Basic Principles on the Use of Restrictive Measures state that &ldquo;Sanctions should be targeted in a way that has maximum impact on those whose behaviour we want to influence. Targeting should reduce to the maximum extent possible any adverse humanitarian effects or unintended consequences for persons not targeted &hellip;.&rdquo; Accordingly, the EU&rsquo;s Syria sanctions include specific exemptions for essential civilian needs and for humanitarian assistance. Ireland has been a consistent advocate for ensuring such exemptions are included.</p>  <p>  In line with the EU strategy on Syria, the EU is maintaining its restrictive measures against the Syrian regime and its supporters as long as the repression of civilians continues. To repeal these sanctions could be misconstrued as tacit acquiescence in the actions of the Assad regime and therefore serve to encourage a belief in impunity with regard to attacks on civilians, and disregard for the UN-led peace process. </p>  <p>  The EU does however keep the impact of sanctions under constant review, and will consider options to mitigate any unintended consequences which can be documented as relating directly to the measures themselves, as distinct from the more general economic disruption caused by the conflict. The relevant working groups in Brussels propose options to address any unintended negative impacts where they are identified. </p>  <p>  For example, in 2016 the EU amended the Syria sanctions regime to make it easier for NGOs operating in Syria to buy fuel. In 2017, EU Member States including Ireland consulted with NGOs to identify any further difficulties they were experiencing in carrying out humanitarian work in Syria that may have been linked to the sanctions. Based on the feedback of the NGOs, the European Commission published a Frequently Asked Questions document to clarify certain provisions of the sanctions identified as unclear by NGOs, as well as the humanitarian exemptions and derogations. In April of this year, EU Member States reviewed best practice guidelines on humanitarian exemptions, with a view to facilitating the work of NGOs responding to humanitarian crises, including the crisis in Syria. I welcome the ongoing work to implement the findings of previous reviews.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department, based both in Dublin and Belfast, monitor this case as part of their wider engagement with the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland on justice and prison matters.  The persons concerned were convicted of murder by joint enterprise at their trial in 2012.  Their appeal against their convictions failed at the Belfast High Court in 2012 and in 2015 the Supreme Court in London refused them permission to mount a further appeal.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the case is now being looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, an independent public body which is responsible for reviewing possible miscarriages of justice in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.  At this stage in the proceedings it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.  It is important that we respect the legal process and allow time for it to reach its conclusion. </p>  <p>  My officials in the Irish Secretariat in Belfast regularly engage with the NI Department of Justice, the Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the Criminal Justice Inspectorate, the NI Police Ombudsman, and NI Prisoner Ombudsman.  In addition, at the recent British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, Minister Flanagan and I engaged with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, David Lidington and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, on matters related to Security Cooperation. </p>  <p>  Officials will continue to monitor developments in this case and the Government will take action as appropriate.  In the absence of a devolved Assembly, it is regrettable that we do not have a locally elected and accountable Justice Minister with whom we could engage with on matters such as this but we will continue our efforts in this regard.</p></reply>

Already, vulnerable people and communities in the least developed countries, in particular women and children, are struggling to cope with the consequences of erratic weather patterns.  Additionally, an increasing number of severe weather events is putting response systems and communities under strain.    Through Ireland&rsquo;s official overseas assistance programme, Irish Aid, funding is provided for climate adaptation and mitigation activities, particularly in least developed countries. This funding consists of contributions to multilateral organisations, grants to NGOs, and programmes implemented through our Embassies. </p>  <p>  In 2016, the Programme for Government committed Ireland to spending &euro;175m in climate finance to 2020. We are well on track to meet that target. Irish climate finance expenditure is rigorously tracked, with annual reporting to the UN on how Ireland is meeting commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In 2016, Ireland was voted by Adaptation Watch as the second most transparent donor in its reporting of climate finance. </p>  <p>  In that year, almost &euro;53m was spent on international climate action, rising to &euro;64m in 2017. The vast majority of these funds were targeted at adaptation activities for the poorest people in Least Developed Countries. This finance was 100% in grant form. A similar outturn for Irish Aid climate expenditure in 2018 is anticipated.  </p>  <p>  A new policy on international development is currently being finalised, which will set out my Department&rsquo;s ambitions for climate action in the years ahead, as the Irish Aid budget increases in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment - set out in the Global Ireland policy document launched earlier this year - to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNI for official development assistance by 2030.</p></reply>

These measures will take effect from 1 January 2019.  All receipts from betting duty go to the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  The rate of betting duty at 1 per cent on the amount of bets wagered in Ireland is at an all-time low, and betting duty receipts are exceptionally low when compared to other sectors subject to excise taxes. It is also the case that there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. With the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 now well embedded in, I believe it is timely to increase the rates of Betting Duty and Betting Intermediary Duty.</p>  <p>  I am familiar with arguments put forward by the betting sector regarding the impact of the increase in betting duty. I acknowledge that advances in technology have challenged existing business models and have changed the structure of many markets, including the betting market, with more betting taking place online. I further acknowledge that smaller bookmakers may have ongoing difficulties competing in that environment or indeed with large retail bookmakers. While I have sympathy for small bookmakers I cannot apply the increase to some bookmakers and not others. Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters.    </p>  <p>  I should point out that my Department held a consultation with the sector last year asking if the current model was appropriate and the overwhelming response was that it was. The main focus of the sector's engagement during this consultation was to oppose any increase in the betting duty, which leaves me with few options in this regard other than to impose a straight forward increase in the current regime. </p>  <p>  We must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers. This needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime. </p>  <p>  The Government fully accepts that the issue of problem gambling is a serious one that needs to be addressed. Earlier this year the Government approved the drafting of a new general scheme of a Gambling Control Bill which will provide for a strengthened regulatory framework for the wider gambling sector. My colleague, Minister of State Stanton, has stated that a key element of the proposed new Gambling Control legislation is that it would permit the establishment and operation of a social fund supported by industry levies, further that such a fund will support those professional expert organisations involved in addiction treatment.</p></reply>

Articles 17 (Pensions) and 18(2) (Government Service) of the Convention gave Ireland an exclusive taxing right over this taxpayer&rsquo;s pension. As a consequence, the UK did not have a right to tax this pension and if it did so, it was in contravention of the Convention.

It replaces a pre-existing, more narrowly focused exit charge that was designed as an anti-avoidance measure following the identification of a number of transactions whereby Irish companies migrated their residence to avoid the charge to Irish Capital Gains Tax, disposed of an asset, and then subsequently migrated back into the State.</p>  <p>  The new ATAD-compliant exit tax is a broad-based measure and it is expected that in time it will give rise to Exchequer revenue.  However the nature of the charge is such that it will arise on occasional, stand-alone transactions &ndash; a charge will arise where a company migrates residence while holding assets, or transfers assets abroad, such that the assets leave the Irish tax net, in cases where those assets have increased in value and therefore hold an unrealised gain. </p>  <p>  An estimation of the future recurring annual yield would require predicting future changes in asset values, in addition to projections as to future restructuring of companies. As any such estimate at this point would be highly theoretical, no specific provision was made in the Budgetary arithmetic for future exit tax yield, and equally it would not be possible to estimate the change in revenue if an alternate tax rate were to be applied.</p>  <p>  With regard to the rate of exit tax, I am aware that the Deputy has queried the number of submissions to my Department&rsquo;s public consultation on ATAD implementation which recommended a 12.5% exit tax rate. In total, 22 submissions were received in response to the consultation document, of which 15 responded to the question on exit tax.  Of those 15, 12 proposed a rate of 12.5% and the remaining 3 responses did not make a recommendation with regard to the rate.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-27a.297.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112700069#WRF02100"><p>Before addressing the question put down by the Deputy, it would be useful to recall the background to the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) and the circumstances within which the relief operates. </p><p>SARP was introduced in Budget 2012 as part of a strategy to promote Foreign Direct Investment into Ireland, and to allow us to compete internationally to attract highly skilled and mobile executives who act as key decision makers within organisations.  </p><p>The measure provides income tax relief on a portion of income earned by employees, who are assigned by their employer to work in Ireland, and who previously worked abroad for that employer for a minimum of six months.  There is no exemption or relief from USC and PRSI is payable where the individual is not liable to social insurance contributions in the home country. </p><p>It should also be noted that individuals who benefit from SARP make a substantial contribution to the exchequer in terms of income tax, USC and PRSI which would not otherwise arise if these individuals were not located in Ireland.</p><p>The existence of an incentive like SARP is an acknowledgement that we are competing on a global basis for highly skilled and mobile executives.  Given the mobility of these individuals, and the existence of similar assignee schemes in competitor jurisdictions, it is possible that if SARP was abolished these individuals would not have chosen to locate in Ireland.  </p><p>The 2016 annual Revenue report on SARP shows that for the years 2012 to 2016 (the most recent year for which data are available) the costs of the measure were as follows:<table><tr><th>Tax Cost2012 </th><th>Tax Cost2013 </th><th>Tax Cost 2014 </th><th>Tax Cost2015 </th><th>Tax Cost2016 </th></tr><tr><td>&euro;0.1 million</td><td>&euro;1.9 million</td><td>&euro;5.9 million</td><td>&euro;9.5 million</td><td>&euro;18.1 million</td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the &euro;18.1 million tax cost for 2016, it is also worth noting that SARP directly generated 793 jobs in that year, which resulted in a very significant tax contribution to the exchequer. Employers also reported that an extra 477 employees had been employed by their companies in 2016, and 607 employees retained by companies in 2016 for which the exchequer benefited directly from additional tax from these associated jobs retained and created through SARP.  </p><p>In terms of the Deputy's question, it is not clear that there would be any net savings to the Exchequer if the programme was abolished. On the contrary, it may well be the case that there could be a net loss to the Exchequer arising from such a move.  As the Deputy is aware, only a proportion of income is disregarded for income tax purposes under SARP and the majority of a person's income remains liable to taxation.  Also, as already indicated, USC applies on the full amount of the person's income.  It is unclear what proportion of SARP beneficiaries, if any, might remain in the jurisdiction if the measure was withdrawn.  Furthermore, such a withdrawal would inevitably have implications for the numbers of SARP-related jobs that would be created in the future and, by extension, the tax revenues that would be associated with those jobs.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, I recently brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill 2018 to place a ceiling on eligible income for SARP recipients at &euro;1 million.  This change will be effective for new entrants to the programme from 1 January 2019 and for existing beneficiaries of the programme from 1 January 2020.  In addition, I announced that a full review of SARP will be carried out in 2019.  I expect that this exercise will, among other things, afford an opportunity to examine in greater detail the issues raised in the Deputy's question.</p></reply>

The Department of Finance produces a TSG paper annually on Capital Taxes.  This year's Capital Taxes TSG paper, which can be found at<i></i></p><p><i>, examined options to change both the CGT rate and the lifetime limit for the Revised Entrepreneur Relief. </i></p><p>Most recent estimates indicate that in the absence of behavioural change each 1% reduction in the rate of CGT was estimated to reduce yield by approximately &euro;36m annually, while the cost to increase the lifetime limit for Revised Entrepreneur Relief to &euro;5m or &euro;15m was estimated at approximately &euro;39m and &euro;50m respectively. </p><p>Whilst all taxes are subject to ongoing review, you will appreciate that all policy choices with respect to changes in taxation are made from both a broader policy perspective and in the context of the financial resources available.  In light of this, I decided not to amend the rate of Capital Gains Tax or the Revised Entrepreneur Relief as part of Budget 2019, however these matters will again be subject to review during preparations for Budget 2020.</p><p>In relation to R&amp;amp;D Tax Credits, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that in putting together a claim for the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, companies must have regard to two interlocking parts: the claim must pass the science test (i.e. is the activity a qualifying activity) and the accounting test must be satisfied (i.e. is the amount of the claim correct).  Revenue inform me that they have detailed R&amp;amp;D guidance on the operation of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, for all companies, which is designed to remove some of the uncertainty that companies may have. Furthermore, Revenue advise me that they are currently working on guidance in relation to the level of records that they would expect to see to support a claim for the R&amp;amp;D tax credit.  It is their expectation that this new guidance will give all companies greater certainty in advance of submitting a claim for relief.</p><p>In February 2017 Revenue issued guidance aimed specifically at micro and small companies, to reduce the administrative burden on SMEs while also ensuring that the credit is granted to bona fide R&amp;amp;D. The aim of this guidance was to give these smaller companies greater clarity on how they could demonstrate to Revenue that their R&amp;amp;D tax credit claim satisfied the &ldquo;science test&rdquo;. Where a company spends &euro;200,000 on activities which Enterprise Ireland have looked at and confirmed as R&amp;amp;D, then in most cases Revenue will accept that those activities pass the science test. Revenue may still review that the accounting test has been satisfied. </p><p>As Revenue engage independent, case specific, experts where there is uncertainty in respect of whether or not the activities are qualifying R&amp;amp;D activities, any pre-approval would out of necessity be cumbersome and slow, potentially acting as a barrier to companies carrying out R&amp;amp;D.  In respect of the accounting test, it is not possible to judge if an amount will be incurred in carrying on R&amp;amp;D until that R&amp;amp;D is actually carried out and that amount is actually incurred.  As such, in addition to the difficulty of putting in place pre-approval in relation to the science test, it is not possible to put in place a pre-approval process for the accounting test. </p><p>Finally, Revenue advise me that all R&amp;amp;D claims are currently dealt with by their Medium Enterprises Division or Large Cases Division.  There is an internal network of experienced R&amp;amp;D auditors from those divisions who meet and share their experiences.  Revenue also engage with external stakeholders through the Tax Administration Liaison Committee (TALC), where there is a specific sub-group which looks at R&amp;amp;D issues.</p></reply>

While the Report on the Cost of Employer Liability and Public Liability Insurance was published in January 2018, containing 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions.  Both reports contain Action Plans which set out agreed timelines for implementation as well as a commitment that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  </p>  <p>  The seventh such update was published earlier this month and can be accessed on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website under the &lsquo;Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo; section.  The Deputy may wish to note that this provides an update on the implementation of each recommendation as well as a traffic light indicator on the status of each individual action point, including those with deadlines into the future (19 relating to the Motor Report and 11 relating to the EL/PL Report).  The Update shows that of the 78 separate applicable deadlines within the Action Plans of the two Reports to the end of Q3 2018, 62 relate to actions which have now been completed, while substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  I believe this quarterly report outlines the significant amount of work being done to address the cost of insurance problem.  In this regard, there has been significant progress on a number of legislative fronts as well as the publication of the second Personal Injury Commission report on benchmarking of awards.  </p>  <p>  While I acknowledge that some deadlines have yet to be met, the general direction of travel is positive and this is reflected in the most recent CSO figures (for October 2018) which indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.9% since peaking in July 2016.  In this regard, I can assure the Deputy that the implementation of the recommendations remains a priority for the Government and I remain confident that the continued implementation of them cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

However, there is a Revenue concession which allows the zero rate to be applied to certain types of food supplements (vitamins, minerals and fish oils).  The practice of zero rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil food supplements has been applied since the introduction of VAT in November 1972 when the marketplace for food supplements was small.  However, this concession is proving to be extremely problematic. </p>  <p>  Elements of the food supplement industry has made a sustained challenge to the application of the standard rate of VAT to a range of food supplements.  There are concerns that while elements of the industry apply the correct rates, others have a competitive advantage by applying the zero rate to products that are properly liable at the 23% VAT rate.  Their argument is generally that the products concerned are similar and compete with other products that are zero rated.  </p>  <p>  There has been protracted correspondence on the issues raised which has raised concerns regarding possible non-compliance in the sector, in particular the zero rating of products that should be standard rated which may result in a degree of unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.  </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s position is that food supplements are not food and, as such, are not entitled under VAT law to the zero rate of VAT; therefore, the standard rate of VAT applies.  The concession in relation to vitamins and the like is proving unworkable as the industry seeks to use the concession to achieve a zero rating for much of the product range in the sector.    </p>  <p>  After consultations between Revenue, Department of Health and my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Budget 2019, reservations were expressed by the Department of Health as to the implications a change might may have on the promotion of food supplements in certain circumstances.  For these reasons, I decided not to make any changes in this year&rsquo;s Budget and Finance Bill.  However, I have asked my officials to address this matter in the context of the Tax Strategy Group next year.</p></reply>

The cost will vary depending on whether and to the extent that the taxpayer concerned has taxable income and whether such income is taxable at the standard or marginal rate of income tax. </p>  <p>  Allowable expenses for employees, including flat rate expenses, are also claimed through different channels depending on the status of the taxpayer. For some employees, the allowances may be carried forward from year to year and applied automatically through the PAYE system at pay roll level.  For other employees, particularly those in receipt of non-PAYE income, the allowances may be claimed through the annual income tax returns, the Form 11 (which taxpayers within the self assessment system are obliged to complete) or the Form 12 Return of Income. As the Form 11 or Form 12 returns are not required to be returned until 10 months after the year end, returns for the 2017 tax year were only due in November 2018.  Thus, the final position on the cost of flat rate expenses allowances for 2017 cannot be reasonably estimated until full returns data is available and analysed. This will also require analysis of information contained in the 2017 P35 returns by employers of the pay and tax details of employees under the PAYE system, which were due in February 2018.  With late filers, processing of returns and parsing of data, Revenue has advised that complete information on expenses for the 2017 tax year will not be available until mid 2019. </p>  <p>  Finally, as I have indicated in response to previous questions on this subject, Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing review of the flat rate expenses regime is expected to be completed by end 2019. With this in mind, in the interests of fairness to all sectors and employees currently benefitting from the regime, Revenue has decided that the effective date for implementation of any changes to particular flat rate expenses categories will be deferred until 1 January 2020. Any revisions to flat rate expenses categories will be communicated to the relevant employee representative bodies involved in the review process.</p></reply>

It is a whole-of-Government Plan, reflecting in particular the central roles of the key Ministers responsible for the sectors covered by the Plan &ndash; Electricity Generation, the Built Environment, Transport and Agriculture, as well as drawing on the perspectives and responsibilities of a range of other Government Departments.</p><p>The measures that we implement through this first Plan will lay the foundations for transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. To support this ongoing work, the Plan also includes over 100 individual actions for various Ministers and public bodies to take forward. Importantly, the Government recognises that this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the 2050 objective, but began the process of development of medium- to long-term mitigation choices for the next and future decades. Furthermore, it is a &lsquo;living document&rsquo;, which is being updated on an on-going basis.</p><p>As Minister for Finance I am leading on five National Mitigation Plan actions as follows:</p><p>No. 3 Examination of impact of carbon tax and future tax rate. </p><p>Current Status: ESRI study published in October 2018. Further ESRI study in progress which seeks to incorporate multi-annual impacts of carbon tax increases.  </p><p>No. 55 Maintain under continuous review the use of the VRT/Motor Tax system in incentivising the uptake of lower emission technologies. (Leading with Minister for HPCLG)</p><p>Current Status: Kept under continuous review and, in view of the introduction of a new EU wide emissions system known as the WLTP, new approaches were discussed in this year&rsquo;s Environmental Tax Strategy paper. </p><p>No. 56 Continue to encourage the adoption of natural gas as a cleaner transport fuel by maintaining the excise rate applied at the minimum rate allowable under the Energy Tax Directive.</p><p>Current Status: The excise rate for natural gas is maintained at the minimum allowable under the Energy Tax Directive while the Accelerated Capital Allowances Scheme provides tax incentives for the investment in and installation of infrastructure necessary to support the adoption of natural gas as a transportation fuel.</p><p>No. 71 Examine the expansion of existing support schemes.</p><p>Current Status: Existing tax expenditures to encourage the uptake of lower pollutant vehicles were reviewed this year and the 0% BIK rate for electric vehicles is being extended for a further 3 years while the VRT relief for hybrid electric vehicles is being extended for 1 year.</p><p>No. 74 Conduct a review of vehicle and fuel taxation measures within the context of evolving technology development and need to chart a sustainable pathway to the decarbonisation of transport by 2050.</p><p>Current Status: This is being achieved through measure 55 and also through work being undertaken by the Low Emission Vehicles (LEV) Taskforce which my officials participate in.</p><p>I understand that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment shall revert to government with proposals for an ambitious multi-annual, all-of-government plan to set out the actions which must be taken in every government department and body to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. This Plan will build on the previous actions taken by government, including in the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan. In this regard I will fully play my part as Minister for Finance to ensure significant progress is made.</p></reply>

These include:</p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice the contract value);</p>  <p>  - Contracting Authorities are encouraged to divide public contracts into lots;</p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale; and</p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal.</p>  <p>  In addition, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, who has responsibility for public procurement, chairs quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, in accordance with the Programme for Government.  This ensures that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) is heard by Government.</p>  <p>  One of the public procurement options available to Government is PPP, which offers an alternative model for delivering infrastructure that can be effective in particular circumstances.  The Report of the PPP Review, published earlier this year, noted the role that PPPs have played in delivering much needed infrastructure in recent years, particularly during times when Exchequer funding was constrained.  However, the Review did also acknowledged the challenges that PPPs can pose in terms of scale and complexity of the PPP contract.  </p>  <p>  While recommending that PPPs continue to be considered as a procurement option for suitable projects, the report also recommended that in order to address the scale/complexity issue, the scope for creating a new PPP-type procurement option that would be suitable for procuring smaller scale and less complex projects, over a shorter timeframe, be explored as an alternative to the typical PPP procurement option, for such smaller scale projects.   I am pleased to say that work is progressing well on exploring this option and the European PPP Expertise Centre is assisting my Department in the matter.  If successful, this would certainly assist in addressing some of the concerns of the Deputy in relation to typical PPP procurements.   </p>  <p>  I should, of course, also point out that while a number of projects have been, and continue to be, procured by PPP, the vast majority of public works contracts are procured as traditional Exchequer funded projects.  </p>  <p>  However, even in relation to the large scale PPP projects, opportunities exist for the SME sector to play a part in these projects.  The NDFA, as part of the PPP procurement process, incorporates a programme-wide initiative with Enterprise Ireland whereby they host a series of &ldquo;Meet the Buyer&rdquo; events around the country offering small and medium-sized enterprises within the construction sector the opportunity to meet directly with the senior contractors within NDFA managed programmes.</p></reply>

This new policy framework has been designed to deliver better outcomes for the public and will ensure that the citizen is at the centre of policies and service delivery across the whole of the public service. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is prudent and sustainable. A number of budgetary reforms have also been introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews. The actions in Our Public Service 2020 will ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services, while operating within these prudent limits.</p>  <p>  A Public Service Leadership Board (PSLB) has been established to lead the delivery of Our Public Service 2020. For the first time, both civil and public service leaders and managers will work jointly to drive the reform programme. This will ensure there is shared ownership for the actions on reform right across the public service.</p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 contains an added focus on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture and in developing indicators to support an outcomes focus. With this goal in mind, within my Department we have established a Reform Evaluation Unit to focus on monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of reform as well as creating greater links between expenditure and reform.</p></reply>

The launch of the Flood Risk Management Plans in May 2018, following the largest ever study of flood risk in Ireland, has identified that Government investment is feasible to protect 95% of properties at assessed risk from significant flooding through flood relief schemes. The legislative basis for these works includes the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 as amended by the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act 1995. </p>  <p>  There have been a number of further amendments to the principal Act that provide the statutory  framework to ensure work on flood risk management by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland meets the European environmental assessments and other requirements.

Maintenance of Arterial and Drainage District channels, designated under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, is the responsibility of the OPW and Local Authorities respectively.  These include the maintenance by the OPW of the Boyne, Inny and Glyde-and-Dee Arterial Drainage Schemes in County Cavan that in 2018 includes seventy-eight kilometres of river channel maintenance at an estimated cost of &euro;460,000.</p>  <p>  In 1995, due to nationally increasing urbanisation, the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 was amended to facilitate the OPW&rsquo;s implementation of localised flood relief schemes to provide flood protection to cities, towns and villages. </p>  <p>  The launch of the Flood Risk Management Plans in May 2018, following the largest ever study of flood risk in Ireland, has identified that Government investment is feasible to protect 95 percent of properties at assessed risk from significant flooding through flood relief schemes. </p>  <p>  Together with this legislative amendment and in line with the Government's 2004 policy on flood risk management, the OPW has no plans for catchment-wide arterial drainage schemes. However to target the management of flood risk outside of cities, towns and villages, in 2009 the OPW introduced the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. To date there have been 724 schemes approved under this Scheme providing important local flood protection measures to their local flood risk. </p>  <p>  The OPW approved the sum of &euro;205,002 to Cavan County Council, under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for flood defence works for Drumullan. The works comprised a combination of earthen embankment, culvert and flood wall defences to protect the community of Drumullan from the risk of flooding.</p>  <p>  Also, a proposed flood relief scheme for Cavan town, identified by the CFRAM programme, is being progressed at a projected cost of &euro;4.44 million.  This proposed scheme involves the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 110 properties when completed. The proposed scheme is in the first tranche of projects to be progressed directly by Cavan County Council.</p></reply>

Supplementary Estimates are an important element of expenditure management, allowing for the proper alignment of resources within allocations. However, they can only be allowed where they can be accommodated within the overall fiscal parameters. </p><p>As outlined in the Expenditure Report 2019, at the end of September PRSI receipts were over &euro;150 million ahead of profile, and it is currently projected that PRSI receipts will finish the year c. &euro;250 million higher than projected in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018.  In addition, other Departmental receipts, or appropriations-in-aid, are anticipated to finish the year ahead of profile.  It is because of this additional revenue, along with higher than anticipated Exchequer tax receipts, higher-than-projected non tax revenues, and lower non-voted current expenditure, that the increase in gross voted expenditure to be provided by way of Supplementary Estimates can be accommodated. </p><p>The position in relation to Supplementary Estimates takes into account the most up to date trends in Departmental expenditure and receipts.  Last week, Supplementary Estimates were presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and referred to Committee in respect of the following Vote groups: </p><p>- Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Technical);</p><p>- Business, Enterprise and Innovation (Technical);</p><p>- Children and Youth Affairs (Substantive);</p><p>- Defence (Substantive);</p><p>- Employment Affairs and Social Protection (Substantive);</p><p>- Foreign Affairs and Trade (Substantive);</p><p>- Public Expenditure and Reform &ndash; Office of Public Works (Substantive) and Superannuation (Technical); and</p><p>- Transport, Tourism and Sport (Substantive).</p><p>The ceiling for Vote 31 (Transport, Tourism and Sport) is broadly in line with that set out in the Expenditure Report.  The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 32 (Business, Enterprise and Innovation) is of a technical nature, to allow for reallocation of funding within the Vote.  In relation to Vote 35 (Army Pensions) the additional expenditure required to accommodate the Supplementary Estimate for Army Pensions is expected to be offset by underspends elsewhere in the Defence Vote Group.</p><p>A provision for a 100% Christmas Bonus was made in Expenditure Report 2019.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;139 million is required by Vote 37 (Employment Affairs and Social Protection) in order to meet the Exchequer element of this bonus.  Finally, while Vote 40 (Children and Youth Affairs) was below profile at the end of October there are pressures emerging on the Community Childcare scheme.  The Department is looking to offset the increased costs arising to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>Expenditure Report 2019 outlined that substantive Supplementary Estimates would also be required for the following Vote groups:</p><p>- Education and Skills;</p><p>- Justice and Equality;</p><p>- Health; and</p><p>- Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>Arrangements are being made to present Supplementary Estimates from these Vote groups to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the coming days.</p></reply>

An OECD team visited Ireland in September 2018 and conducted an assessment of the central Government Accounting Framework with the aim of identifying a road map for the implementation of financial reporting reforms.  The OECD assessment includes a gap analysis between the current accounting framework and international best practice and accounting standards.  The OECD's final report and recommendations for phased implementation of financial reporting reforms is due by end 2018.  OECD will present the main findings and recommendations of its report in a second mission planned for January 2019.  I anticipate that the implementation of this road map may also have implications for corporate governance standards and arrangements in relation to public financial management and accountability, and my Department will be keeping this area under active review in this context.  </p>  <p>  As discussed in the Expenditure Report and the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, there is a spending review process currently underway that will continue beyond 2018.  The spending review looks at the trends, sustainability, efficiency and effectiveness of specific spending programmes with the goal of ensuring that public money is used in the most efficient way possible.  The spending review in 2018 highlighted necessary improvements to date in identifying data gaps and the scope to further improve and identify performance metrics and indicators.  A further spending review cycle will commence in 2019, where the monitoring and improvement in performance will once again be core to the review. </p>  <p>  Work is also well underway on revisions to aspects of the Public Spending Code, in particular the technical parameters for expenditure appraisal, and it is intended to finalise these revisions and update the Public Spending Code accordingly.</p></reply>

Total voted expenditure in 2019 will be over &euro;66.5 billion, with over &euro;59.2 billion allocated to current expenditure, a c. 4 per cent increase on the current expenditure provision in 2018.  This will allow Government to continue to incrementally enhance the delivery of public services, including in key areas such as health and education, for the benefit of all our citizens.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 - the National Development Plan (NDP) and the National Planning Framework (NPF) &ndash; was launched by the Government earlier this year.  The NDP sets out a 10 year vision for Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure priorities over the next 10 years strictly aligned with the National Strategic Outcomes for Ireland&rsquo;s new spatial strategy contained in the NPF.  The NDP demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure and investment needs over the next ten years, through a total investment estimated at &euro;116 billion.  This level of capital spending will ensure ongoing employment maintenance and creation with appropriate regional development. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 seeks to achieve ten strategic outcomes, building around the themes of wellbeing, equality and opportunity.  These ten shared priorities will ensure a consistent approach between planning objectives under the NPF and investment commitments under the NDP.</p>  <p>  Turning to budgetary reform to support delivery of equality objectives, following a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to &lsquo;develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights&rsquo; an Equality Budgeting pilot was implemented for the 2018 budgetary cycle.  The approach I have taken in introducing Equality Budgeting in Ireland is that equality budgeting is to be integrated into the existing budgetary process.  Therefore, equality budgeting is contained within the existing performance budgeting framework and utilises the processes already in place. </p>  <p>  The measures identified in the pilot related mainly to gender equality but as I outlined in my budget statement in October equality budgeting remains a priority for the coming year and I am therefore expanding the programme to further develop the gender budgeting elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality.  This expansion is being supported by an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group which will bring expert knowledge on how best to progress this important work.   This group is comprised of expert stakeholders such as the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, IHREC, NESC, the ESRI and a number of Government Departments. </p>  <p>  Another element in responding to the Programme for Government commitment regarding equality budgeting has been the development of a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) Framework, which is designed to focus on policy areas that cannot easily be incorporated into the existing SWITCH model, specifically the impacts of public expenditure on recipient households.  The framework allows evaluators to broaden the scope of the current SIA practice to take account of not only tax and social welfare measures, but also assess how changes in public expenditure policy can impact on household outcomes and living standards.</p></reply>

The role of the CSG is to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector in relation to issues that may impact on the successful delivery of the NDP on a value-for-money basis for the State.</p><p>The CSG brings together both key industry segments and relevant representatives from key Government Agencies and Departments.  The industry bodies represented are:</p><p>- Construction Industry Federation</p><p>- Irish Congress for Trade Unions</p><p>- Building Materials Federation</p><p>- Engineers Ireland</p><p>- Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland</p><p>- Royal Institute of the Architecture of Ireland</p><p>- Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland</p><p>- Irish Planning Institute</p><p>The production by DPER of a Construction Sector Activity Report will be an important source of evidence to inform discussion of the CSG.  A work programme will be developed to set the agenda over the next 18-24 months and will include:</p><p>- Working with industry and government bodies to (a) benchmark and improve productivity and environmental sustainability and (b) to modernise public works delivery</p><p>- Considering opportunities to introduce reforms within the sector that will help in controlling construction price inflation, improving efficiency and delivering value for money for investment</p><p>- The supply of necessary skills and measures enhancing capacity (including potential use of overseas contractors)</p><p>- Issues arising from inadequate or ineffective regulation, poor performance and systemic poor quality</p><p>While the focus of the CSG is the successful delivery of the NDP rather than the property market, I would expect the work of this group will complement any actions in the space of promoting efficiency and cost effectiveness in the construction sector which should benefit the citizen.</p></reply>

There are important measures in place to ensure that our budgetary targets are being met and my Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  Expenditure profiles are published for each month, and the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  The management of expenditure within the overall fiscal parameters over the last number of years has played a key role in ensuring that we have continued to meet out fiscal targets.  However, given the scale of Government expenditure - &euro;61.8 billion in aggregate for gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 - and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues, and overspends.  They are a budgetary tool that allows for the proper alignment of funding allocations with planned expenditure.  Of course, they can only be allowed where they can be accommodated within the overall fiscal parameters.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-October 2018 was &euro;49,931 million, which is broadly on profile.  Net voted expenditure of &euro;40,142 million was &euro;168 million below profile with net voted spending in 14 out of 17 Vote Groups being below profile.  </p>  <p>  Ensuring long-lasting benefits for citizens and the economy requires a focus on value for money.  A number of measures are in place to support value for money in terms of capital and current expenditure.  During 2018, my Department has engaged with a range of Departments on year two of the Spending Review process, with a view to reinforcing a systematic analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability.  In the last two years of the Spending Review process, over 50 analytical papers have been produced. </p>  <p>  In relation to capital expenditure, the National Development Plan (NDP) has set an investment in infrastructure of almost &euro;116 billion over the ten year period to 2027.  Such a level of investment requires a strong framework to drive its implementation and increased transparency on the projects and programmes being supported by this investment.  In this regard, a high-level Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board has been established.  The Project Delivery Board will continue to provide strategic direction and leadership to the NDP and National Planning Framework (NPF) implementation process.  The Delivery Board will monitor and oversee implementation structures and performance across the various sectors to ensure a co-ordinated and collaborative whole of Government approach to NDP and NPF delivery.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that a number of open competitions have already taken place or are in the process of taking place for recruitment to the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Public Appointments Service, who are the independent recruiter for the Civil Service, that since the lifting of the moratorium, approximately 9,500 civil servants from open competitions excluding temporary assignments and professional and technical posts, have been assigned to Government departments and offices across general service grades.  This figure would, of course be offset by retirements and other people leaving the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  In the Civil Service in 2018, competitions for Clerical Officer, Administrative Officer, and Assistant Principal Officer have commenced or taken place.</p>  <p>  It is too early to say at this stage what competitions will be held for all of 2019.  Factors such as the demand from Departments/offices from existing panels, consequential vacancies arising, retirements and defined skill demands will influence decisions to hold competitions and these are currently being assessed. </p></reply>

The OGP and its sector partners put in place Framework Agreements and contracts through which public sector bodies can buy these common goods and services, broken down into 16 categories of expenditure.</p>  <p>  The reform of public procurement in Ireland is being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises to the Irish economy.  The aim is to drive fair, transparent and open competition in the marketplace but also to work with business to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly. </p>  <p>  The OGP works with the SME industry representative bodies (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) as well as the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the engagement of SMEs in public procurement.  Given the budgetary pressures, public procurement reform can support the dual objectives of meeting our fiscal targets and enhancing public services. </p>  <p>  All public bodies are keenly aware of the importance of maximising the value for money achievable when procuring any commonly acquired goods or services.  The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the OGP have been designed to optimise benefits to the public service through the strategic aggregation of its buying power. The OGP is continuing to refine the central procurement model in order to strengthen and improve it, in line with the Programme for Government commitments.</p></reply>

My Department does not have specific climate change targets save for the objective  of improving its energy efficiency by 33% by 2020.    </p>  <p>  A sustained whole of Government approach will be required to enable Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. I am, together with my Department, committed to playing our part in this transition. </p>  <p>  For example, earlier this month my Department published significant reforms to the Public Spending Code, which will, when adopted, require all Government investment projects to price future greenhouse gas emissions at the estimated cost that Irish society will have to bear in reaching our climate targets in their appraisal.</p>  <p>  As I announced on Budget Day, Ireland has also joined the OECD Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting. My objective in joining this initiative is to integrate environmental and climate outcome based reporting into our annual budgetary processes. This will be an iterative process but Ireland's participation in the Paris collaborative will lead to more transparency on the level and effectiveness of Ireland's climate expenditure. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service (IGEES) was created to enhance the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policy making. IGEES has already conducted reviews of areas of climate related expenditure and will continue to systematically analyse the performance of programmes to gather evidence to support better informed decisions.</p>  <p>  In addition to funding made available to Departments for tacking climate change through the annual budgetary/estimates process, the National Development Plan/Project Ireland 2040 also provides significant increased levels of funding for climate action related measures. Project Ireland 2040 commits a record level of investment for climate change initiatives over the next decade, with &euro;21.8bn specifically allocated for Transition to a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient society (National Strategic Outcome 8).  </p>  <p>  In addition, a number of the other National Strategic Outcomes in the NDP are also directly relevant to delivering on our climate action goals - &euro;14.5 billion is allocated to encouraging compact smart growth and a further &euro;8.6 billion is allocated for investment in environmentally sustainable public transport while &euro;8.8 billion is allocated for the sustainable management of water and other environmental resources.  The NDP also established a &euro;500m Climate Action Fund which will leverage investment by public and private bodies in climate action measures. The results from the first round of applications to this fund will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

This scheduled further lessening of the PSPR impact on pensions will mean that from 1 January 2019 all pensions up to &euro;39,000 per annum will be exempt from PSPR, removing some 12,000 pensioners from the impact of PSPR.</p>  <p>  From 1 January 2020, further PSPR-amelioration will mean that all pensions up to &euro;54,000 per annum will be exempt from PSPR, removing some 10,500 additional pensioners from the impact of PSPR.</p>  <p>  When fully in place from the beginning of 2020, these changes will mean that the vast majority of public service retirees - approximately 97% - comprising everyone with occupational pension values up to at least &euro;54,000, will be entirely free of PSPR. For those who retired since end-February 2012 that threshold will be even higher at &euro;60,000.</p>  <p>  Section 26 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act, 2017 requires the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to make an order, no later than 31 December 2020, setting a date for the complete elimination of PSPR from all public service pensions.</p>  <p>  This approach can be seen in the context that restoration of the public service pension cuts has proceeded at a faster pace than has applied to the FEMPI pay measures.</p>  <p>  This implies that only those pensions whose associated contemporary salaries are, at a minimum, &euro;108,000 (or &euro;120,000 for the post-February 2012 retiree group), will bear any PSPR impact beyond the end of 2020.  I can assure the Deputy that the timetable set out in the Act will be complied with. </p></reply>

In the region of 3,500 of the highest value pre-March 2012 pensions will continue to be subjected to PSPR from then onwards.  In addition to the currently legislated reduction in PSPR yield for 2020, the estimated additional cost of full abolition of PSPR in 2020 is &euro;12m and while the bulk of this cost would relate to pre-March 2012 pensioners, a disaggregated estimate between pre and post-2012 pensioners is not currently available.</p>  <p>  In addition to the PSPR amelioration, many public service pensioners stand to benefit from the public service pension increase policy which Government has agreed to as part of the PSSA 2018-2020.</p>  <p>  For the duration of the Agreement, i.e. until end-2020, that policy means that there will be an effective limited return to the traditional &ldquo;pay parity&rdquo; link, whereby pay increases awarded to public servants are passed on proportionately to the pensions of retired public servants:  </p>  <p>  - For post-February 2012 retirees, this means that that they will receive pension increases in line with the pay increases due to their peers currently in employment over the three-year lifetime of the PSSA to end-2020. </p>  <p>  - Pre-2012 retirees, whose pensions are already based on superior (pre-2010 salary level), will see their pensions likewise boosted during the 2018-2020 period where that is necessary to keep pace with the value of a pension awarded to a same-profile person retiring just after each particular pay increase.</p></reply>

My Department has a number of measures aimed at addressing the current challenges for teacher supply.  A Steering Group on Teacher Supply, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established in March 2018.  The membership of the group includes nominees of the Department, HEIs providing primary and post primary initial teacher education, the Teaching Council, the HEA, primary and post primary school management bodies, as well as an independent expert.  Addressing the issue of teacher supply is complex and involves consideration of a wide range of issues including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply and promotion of the teaching profession.  Arising from the work of the steering group an Action Plan for Teacher Supply was published earlier this month with actions identified under four policy headings:  Data/Research; Higher Education; Promotion of the teaching profession; Policies and arrangements impacting on teacher supply.  The Steering Group will oversee the implementation of the Action Plan which aims to address the current challenges in Teacher Supply and ensure adequate supply of appropriately qualified teachers into the future.</p>  <p>  In relation to concessions for students in the school referred to, that are due to sit the leaving certificate examination in 2019, some flexibility may be possible around the completion dates for practical coursework.  The school in question should contact the State Examinations Commission (SEC) directly for advice in this regard.  No further concessions can be granted in relation to marking of candidates&rsquo; examination work as ultimately all candidates must be subject to the same marking procedures and standards.  This is consistent with one of the underlying principles of the operation of the State Examinations in that the SEC must apply marking schemes uniformly to all candidates in the interests of inter-candidate equity.</p></reply>

The specific YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68 m (for 2014 and 2015) is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.  Ireland was not eligible for an additional allocation under the second YEI allocation arising from the mid-term revision of the Multi-annual Financial Framework in 2017.</p><p>All ESF activities, including YEI activities, are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer with the EU (ESF/YEI) funding being claimed in arrears.  Seven activities were originally selected for YEI funding namely, the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA); JobBridge; JobsPlus; Momentum; Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP); T&uacute;s; and Youthreach.  Improvements in the rate of youth unemployment coupled with the discontinuance of the JobBridge and Momentum schemes had consequences for the expenditure expected on YEI activities.  Consequently, the Programme Monitoring Committee agreed to the inclusion of the Community Training Centres; the Defence Forces Employment Support Scheme (DFESS) and the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) under the YEI.  At the same time, the Committee agreed to the removal of the T&uacute;s, JobBridge and the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme from the YEI, having unsuccessfully explored the potential to use Simplified Cost Option models and/or in the light of audit trail difficulties.  The current gross allocations under the YEI for the activities are:<table><tr><th>(BTWEA) Scheme</th><th>&euro;4,647,870</th></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus </td><td>&euro;7,992,000</td></tr><tr><td>Youthreach</td><td>&euro;101,156,387</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>&euro;13,800,000</td></tr><tr><td>CTCs</td><td>&euro;60,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>DFESS</td><td>&euro;840,000</td></tr><tr><td>YESS</td><td>&euro;16,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Priority Totals</td><td>&euro;204,436,257</td></tr></table>The first payment application in respect of the PEIL, which has recently been submitted to the European Commission includes &euro;112 m in respect of the YEI.  The ESF authorities will ensure that sufficient payment applications are submitted to fully drawdown the YEI funding allocations.</p><p>With regard to Erasmus PRO, Leargas has advised that to date, &euro;780,430 has been awarded to 5 projects representing 110 learner mobilities broken down as follows:</p><p>- 2015 awarded &euro; 25,391 for 4  long term learner mobilities;</p><p>- 2016 awarded &euro; 62,836 for 10 long term learner mobilities;</p><p>- 2017 awarded &euro; 157,918 for 24 long term learner mobilities;</p><p>- 2017 awarded &euro; 169,800 for 27 long term learner mobilities; and</p><p>- 2018 awarded &euro; 364,485 for 45 long term learner mobilities</p><p>In addition Leargas currently had 1 project application on assessment for the October 2018 round which if included would bring the total to &euro;880,283 in respect of 122 learner mobilities.</p></reply>

Schools should seek the advice of the National Educational Psychology Service before implementing such arrangements.</p><p>My Department does not hold the data requested by the Deputy.</p><p>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires a school principal to inform an educational welfare officer in writing where a student is suspended from a recognised school for a period of not less than 6 days. The school is also obliged to record and maintain attendance records and to report to Tusla, unauthorised non-attendance above the threshold of 20 days, or where the school principal is of the opinion that a student is not attending school regularly. This is done currently through the School Returns mechanism to TUSLA Educational Welfare Services.</p><p>Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools (NEWB, 2008) states that <i>&ldquo;Exclusion of a student for part of the school day, as a sanction, or asking parents to keep a child from school, as a sanction, is a suspension. Any exclusion imposed by a school is a suspension, and should follow the guidelines relating to a suspension&rdquo;.</i></p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 makes provision for a parent to take an appeal against a school in relation to suspension of a student. In certain circumstances reduced timetables could be appealed by a parent under this provision.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is engaging with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and TUSLA Educational Welfare Service on the matter of reduced timetables, with a view to examining options which can be taken to address the issues raised.</p></reply>

Under Section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes are subject to review and accreditation by the Teaching Council, in accordance with the Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (published in 2011 and revised in March 2017). In accordance with these Criteria and Guidelines, inclusive education is a mandatory component for all students in ITE. Inclusive education encompasses education of children with special educational needs, including autism.</p><p>The learning outcomes of ITE programmes also reflect the need for the teacher to be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs; to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching; to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils; to evaluate learner progress; to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes.</p><p>The Teaching Council is currently carrying out a review of the impact of the current programmes, with a view to amending the Criteria and Guidelines before the next round of accreditation commences in 2020.</p><p>A recently published report from the National Council for Special Education on <i>Initial Teacher Education for Inclusion: Phase 1 and 2</i>(NCSE Research Report No. 26), found that there is in general much good practice related to inclusive education in ITE, particularly in relation to the fostering of positive attitudes to inclusion, while also noting scope for further alignment between theory and practice, in particular as between student placement and the university experience. These findings will be considered by the Teaching Council in the course of its work.</p><p>There are also a range of in-service professional development supports provided to teachers by the Department. Since March 2017, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service, has a remit to develop schools&rsquo; capacity to include students with special educational needs and to promote a continuum of educational provision which is inclusive and responsive.</p><p>The role of the NCSE Support Service includes enhancing the quality of learning and teaching in relation to special educational provision. The service co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special schools and special classes.</p><p>In addition to the above, the Department provides funding support for teachers to expand their capacity through courses at the Middletown Centre for Autism and through funded post-graduate provision at a number of higher education institutions for teachers involved in Learning Support &amp;amp; Special Education.</p></reply>

This decision is based a recommendation contained within a professional assessment in consultation with the NCSE.</p><p>Students enrolling in specialised placements must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals stating that: </p><p>- S/he has a disability (in line with the designation of the special placement in question) and</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a specialised setting and thereasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for organising and planning provision for children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special classes in mainstream primary and post primary schools. </p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.</p><p>124 special schools also provide specialist education for those students with complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with ASD.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need in Dublin from year to year, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>The NCSE advises parents to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.</p><p>Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement, for the 2019/20 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process. Contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>As the Deputy has not provided adequate details I cannot comment on the specific case to which you refer. I would advise the Deputy to refer the specific case, including details in relation to the child, to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for their attention and direct reply. </p><p>My Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities has been challenging.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when fully commenced will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient capacity in relation to the provision of education for children with special educational needs. </p><p>Section 8 of the Act, which will commence from Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs. </p><p>The NCSE is engaging with the education partners and will finalise procedures in advance of this date.

More detailed information relating to enrolment levels in all primary and post-primary schools nationwide is available on the Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>. </p><p>In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  I have highlighted that the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>While the announcement did not include a new primary school in the Ballincollig school planning area, two new primary schools were announced for the adjoining school planning areas as follows:</p><p>- a new 8 classroom primary school to serve the Glasheen_CorkCity/Pouladuff school planning area to be established in 2019; and</p><p>- a new 16 classroom primary school to serve the Carrigaline school planning area to be established in 2020.</p><p>My Department's responsibility is to provide sufficient accommodation to meet 20,000 new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.  It is open to an individual school to apply for accommodation under the additional accommodation scheme if the school does not have sufficient capacity to meet school places.</p></reply>

This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment in consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). </p><p>Students enrolling in specialised placements must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals stating that: </p><p>- S/he has a disability (in line with the designation of the special placement in question) and</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a specialised setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) plans and co-ordinates the provision of educational support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p><p>Accordingly, the NCSE advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.

Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>Where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. </p><p>The NCSE have advised my Department&rsquo;s officials that they have no record of an application for support in respect of the student named by the deputy.

The safety of school students and staff has been and will continue to be my Department's overriding priority.</p>  <p>  The two schools referred to by the Deputy opened at ground floor level initially following internal precautionary measures which were carried out over the mid-term break.  Works to the upper floor areas are now underway and it is anticipated that these works will be completed to allow the schools in question to open to receive all students in the next few weeks.  This is the immediate priority for my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department will now be moving as quickly as possible to the next phase, which is to initiate more detailed structural investigations at the 42 schools and, following on from this, to implement the permanent remediation works required.  This will enable an implementation plan to be put in place which will include, as appropriate, projected timelines and expected remediation costs.  Until such time as this work is completed, a robust cost estimate cannot be formulated.  Therefore there are currently no plans at this stage for an additional supplementary estimate.  The Department fully intends to pursue the company through all contractual and legal channels for the cost of the precautionary measures and the remediation work.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools. </p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new post primary school in Gorey (which is located in the Gorey school planning area), the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  My Department's responsibility is to provide sufficient accommodation to meet 20,000 new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.  It is open to an individual school to apply for accommodation under the additional accommodation scheme if the school does not have sufficient capacity to meet school places.</p></reply>

Schools should seek the advice of the National Educational Psychology Service before implementing such arrangements.</p><p>My Department does not hold the data requested by the Deputy. </p><p>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires a school principal to inform an educational welfare officer in writing where a student is suspended from a recognised school for a period of not less than 6 days. The school is also obliged to record and maintain attendance records and to report to Tusla, unauthorised non-attendance above the threshold of 20 days, or where the school principal is of the opinion that a student is not attending school regularly. This is done currently through the School Returns mechanism to TUSLA Educational Welfare Services. </p><p>Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools (NEWB, 2008) states that<i>&ldquo;Exclusion of a student for part of the school day, as a sanction, or asking parents to keep a child from school, as a sanction, is a suspension. Any exclusion imposed by a school is a suspension, and should follow the guidelines relating to a suspension&rdquo;. </i></p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 makes provision for a parent to take an appeal against a school in relation to suspension of a student. In certain circumstances reduced timetables could be appealed by a parent under this provision.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is engaging with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and TUSLA Educational Welfare Service on the matter of reduced timetables, with a view to examining options which can be taken to address the issues raised.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with forty eight research projects at various stages.</p>  <p>  Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Schools technical guidance documents must achieve as a minimum an A3 Building Energy Rating.</p>  <p>  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments.</p>  <p>  In relation to existing schools buildings, my Department provided 100% funding for cavity wall and attic insulation and water conservation in 2009/2010 and energy upgrade works are often an integrated feature in summer works projects.  Going forward a deeper upgrade of the energy efficiency of existing schools will be required to meet the requirements of Government and EU energy efficiency and climate change legislation.  In this regard, a pilot programme on deep energy retrofits is currently being undertaken by my Department in partnership with the SEAI.  This is being carried out with a view to developing a scalable model of energy efficiency retrofits in the school sector into the future, the funding for which will be made available over the lifetime of the National Development Plan.  </p></reply>

Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.</p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). Under the 2005 Act as amended, the power to establish the criteria for community CCTV schemes is a matter for the Policing Authority, by order made with the approval of the Government.</p><p>This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must-</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their establishment. </p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.</p><p>Nonetheless, my Department is engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office has confirmed as recently as May of this year that it does not have any concerns in relation to the legislative basis for CCTV. However it is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV. We expect findings from this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities.</p><p>Finally, I would recall that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In pursuance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department. Community groups and local authorities can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved, with grant aid totalling more than &euro;500,000 approved from the total &euro;1 million available for 2018. A further 4 applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.</p><p>I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme. If the Deputy is aware of community groups wishing to avail of the scheme, full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address <i>communitycctv@justice.ie.</i></p></reply>

The Act enhances and updates laws to combat the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children, including new offences relating to child sexual grooming and new and strengthened offences to tackle child pornography.  The Act also criminalises the purchase of sexual services, introduces new provisions regarding the giving of evidence by victims in sexual offence trials and introduces a new offence addressing public indecency.  Other provisions include maintaining the age of consent to sexual activity at 17 years of age and for a new &ldquo;proximity of age&rdquo; defence as well as a statutory statement of the law as regards consent to sexual acts. </p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Act amends the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, including new provisions around the disclosure of third party counselling notes and other amendments related to the cross-examination of witnesses. These provisions were commenced in May 2018.</p>  <p>  Section 39 of the 2017 Act  inserts a new section 19A into the Criminal Evidence Act 1992. The new section 19A requires an application to be made to the court prior to the disclosure of third-party counselling records in sexual offence proceedings. In considering whether to release any records, the court must consider the interests of justice alongside the privacy of the complainant and the likelihood of harm in releasing the record. The court must also have regard to the public interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual offences and the public interest in encouraging complainants of sexual offences to seek counselling. The section does not apply where a complainant or witness has expressly waived his or her right to non-disclosure of a counselling record without leave of the court.</p>  <p>  Section 19A does not distinguish adult from child complainants. </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware that complainants in sexual violence cases should be treated sensitively in criminal proceedings, most especially when they are children.  The legislative provisions in place are designed to ensure that complainants are supported and facilitated in a way that protects them from any additional harm. </p></reply>

This assessment will be made based on the records of the institutions concerned (where available) and any other relevant records or statements, which  may include the applicant's testimony and in some cases testimony from other persons.  If an applicant has any difficulty obtaining their records from a religious institution or if assistance is requested, the Department will provide it.</p><p>Each application will be assessed individually on its merits.  Decisions will be made on the balance of probabilities. In addition, for those cases where there is insufficient documentary evidence available to make an assessment on their case, an interview process is in place so as to facilitate a fairer assessment of a woman's application.  </p><p>In relation to the age at which a girl started work in a Magdalen laundry,  the information contained in the McAleese Report relates only to girls and women admitted to the Magdalen Institutions. The McAleese Committee did not conduct any research into the adjoining institutions which are now covered by the Addendum.  The statistical analysis carried out by the Committee indicated that the average age on entry into the Magdalen Institutions was 23.8 years of age and the median age was 20 years of age.  While the youngest entrant was identified as 9 years of age, this had occurred in the 1930s.  The McAleese Committee's analysis also shows that only 4.1% were under 14 years of age at the time of entry.  As stated in the Addendum, it is open to an applicant to show that she worked in a Magdalen Laundry before she reached 12 years of age and, where shown, such work would be included in the calculation of the 'work' element of the lump sum.</p></reply>

The current membership is:<table><tr><th>Chair</th><th>Helen Boyle, B.L.</th></tr><tr><td>Ordinary Member</td><td>Martin Lawlor</td></tr><tr><td>Ordinary Member</td><td>Grace Mulherin, B.L.</td></tr><tr><td>Ordinary Member</td><td>Cian Kelly, B.L</td></tr><tr><td>Ordinary Member</td><td>Mema Byrne, B.L.</td></tr><tr><td>Ordinary Member</td><td>Niamh Tuite</td></tr><tr><td>Ordinary Member</td><td>William Aylmer</td></tr></table></p><p>There are currently no vacancies to be filled on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. I have ensured that a full Tribunal membership has been maintained in order to continue to address claims as promptly as possible. The term of office for all Ordinary members has been extended to June 2019 pending the completion of a recruitment process for new members.</p><p>The number of applications received and the amount of compensation paid under both schemes is provided in tabular form below, though I should state that the amount paid out in any given year is not reflective of the applications received in that year, for various reasons, including that compensation payments may relate to applications made in prior years.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Applications Received   (General Scheme)</th><th>Compensation Paid (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>257</td><td>3.955m</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>217</td><td>4.016m</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>210</td><td>3.765m</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>181</td><td>3.978m</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Applications Received   (Prison Officers)</th><th>Compensation Paid(&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>76</td><td>0.977m</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>75 </td><td>0.575m</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>89</td><td>0.750m</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>107</td><td>0.741m</td></tr></table></p><p>It is not possible to provide an average length of time to settle each claim as it varies depending on the circumstances of each case.  While applications are processed with the minimum of formality compared to court proceedings where compensation is being claimed under the Civil Liability Acts, in making their decisions Tribunal Members must be satisfied that all supporting documentation submitted is in order.  In some cases there can be delays pending the availability of all required documentation and some cases are complex in terms of medical conditions being assessed.  </p><p>Because of the manner in which cases are recorded, in particular cases which are open but not actively pursued by the applicant, it is not possible at this time to provide the Deputy with the number of cases awaiting decision and those which are deemed to be open.I have asked that a detailed assessment be made of the caseload with a view to clarifying this matter, and to inform a full review of processing capacity under the scheme.  </p><p>Finally, administrative costs of the Tribunal for the years 2014-2017 are set out below.

The review will seek to establish any lessons to be learned and whether changes to Garda processes and procedures are needed, and will include an examination of the legislative framework.  Following the conclusion of the review, any changes proposed to the law on bail will be considered. </p>  <p>  The bail laws have been significantly strengthened by this Government. The Criminal Justice Act 2017, which came into force last year, expanded the factors a court may take into account when refusing bail. These factors include previous convictions for serious offences which indicate persistent serious offending and the likelihood of any danger to a person or the community that the release of the accused on bail could cause. </p>  <p>  Further to this, the Act has increased the range of conditions that may be attached to a grant of bail such as the imposition of curfews and the prohibition of contact by the accused with the victim or the victim&rsquo;s family. The Act also introduced a new power of arrest without warrant, where a Garda suspects that a person has breached or is about to breach a bail condition and the Garda considers it necessary to arrest the person immediately to prevent harm to, interference with or intimidation of the victim or a witness to the offence alleged.</p></reply>

This is a function of the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.</p>  <p>  Under Irish law, issues arising from disagreements about the provision of maintenance for dependent children, or failure by persons with maintenance responsibilities for children to provide proper maintenance, are determined by the courts.  Relevant legislation in this area includes section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, section 8 of the Family Law Act 1995, section 13 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 and section 45 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provides for a number of improvements in the law relating to maintenance of children.</p>  <p>  It is open to parents who have separated/divorced to decide between themselves on maintenance arrangements for their children.  If they cannot agree, they can try to work out a maintenance agreement through mediation.  However, if parents still cannot agree on maintenance arrangements, an application must be made to the courts for a maintenance order.  If a parent/spouse/civil partner fails to comply with a court order or falls behind with payments where there is a maintenance order in place, an attachment of earnings order can be sought from the court, if the person is in employment or on a private pension. This order results in the maintenance amount being deducted at source by the employer of the parent/spouse/civil partner. A person can apply for an Attachment of Earnings Order when first applying for a maintenance order through the court, if they are concerned that maintenance will not be paid, or they can apply later if the maintenance is not paid. An enforcement summons can be applied for if the parent/spouse/civil partner is self-employed. </p>  <p>  Under section 9A of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, the District Court has the power to regard a failure by a parent/spouse/civil partner to comply with a court order as contempt of court and to deal with it accordingly, including by means of imprisonment.  The maintenance creditor may apply to the District Court Clerk for a summons directing the maintenance debtor to appear before the District Court. The court will then hear evidence from the maintenance creditor and maintenance debtor including evidence about the financial circumstances of the maintenance debtor and, where relevant, the maintenance creditor.</p>  <p>  The other issues raised in the correspondence are not within my remit as Minister for Justice and Equality. I have asked my officials to consult with officials reporting to my colleagues the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection in that regard and will comprehensively respond directly to the Deputy in due course.</p></reply>

However, it is the case that airline carriers in many instances require their passengers to have a passport in possession before allowing them to board the aircraft. As such, this is not an immigration requirement. </p>  <p>  Unlike the operational practices at some UK airports, there is generally no segregation of arriving passengers at Irish ports of entry to the State. Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at airports in the State do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks. It is, therefore, necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation. </p>  <p>  Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a person, who is a citizen of the CTA, and who has travelled from within the CTA, is not in possession of a passport, an Immigration Officer is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is entitled to benefit from the CTA immigration arrangements. The production of a valid driver&rsquo;s licence is a document that would assist an immigration officer with these enquiries. </p></reply>

The Garda authorities advise that the number of Garda vehicles fitted with ANPR equipment varies on a daily basis, due to operational requirements, including repair and maintenance of equipment and &lsquo;end-of-life&rsquo; of vehicles and equipment, the up-dating of software and the decommissioning of damaged units.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 1 November 2018, there are 289 vehicles attached to Roads Policing Units nationwide. 76 of these currently have ANPR capacity, which amounts to just over 26% of the vehicles allocated to Roads Policing Units.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the capacity and capabilities of ANPR, including the expansion of the deployment of such systems within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are kept under regular review by senior Garda management. </p>  <p>  More generally, I can confirm that the Garda Mobility Strategy, which aims to provide frontline members with greater connectivity to back-office systems harnessing the power of mobile technology, forms part of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.

The app gathers information recorded on PULSE in respect of the vehicle, including tax status, ownership information and vehicle warnings. Updates to the App already rolled out include a Driver-Licence check facility.  Work has also commenced on developing the capacity to create a Fixed Charge Notice via an App. </p>  <p>  I am informed that it is expected that mobile devices will enable Garda members to be more efficient and effective by having mobile access to relevant core policing applications, a wide-range of up-to-date information and the ability to input and update information in real time. </p></reply>

These supports aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months.</p><p>In addition to direct supports to firms, I and my Department have been developing a number of schemes to mitigate against the potential effects of Brexit.  In late November 2017 a Rescue and Restructuring (R&amp;amp;R) Scheme was approved by the EU Commission. This scheme has been put in place as it is considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances as necessary.</p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched in April 2018 and provides affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future, to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenge.  </p><p>In May 2018, the Rescue and Restructuring scheme was extended to include temporary restructuring aid for enterprises experiencing acute liquidity needs.  The aid is granted in the form of loans repayable over a period of 18 months.  Together with the Brexit Loan Scheme, this temporary restructuring aid will provide valuable stabilisation to businesses as they respond to the immediate and long-term impacts of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  It will provide low cost loans for terms of between 8-10 years, which is not readily available on the market.  It is expected that this scheme will be operational in Q1 2019.</p><p>Local Enterprise Office funding has been increased and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating. The suite of LEO Brexit supports includes tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &quot;Brexit SME Scorecard&quot; to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and a &quot;Be Prepared Grant&quot; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK. </p><p>InterTrade Ireland's Brexit advisory service was established in May 2017 to provide a focal point for SMEs working to navigate the changes in cross-Border trading relationships brought about by Brexit negotiations. </p><p>As part of awareness-raising activities, EI has rolled out regional Brexit Advisory clinics throughout the year.  My Department and its agencies have also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready roadshow to inform businesses of supports available to them to prepare for Brexit.I will continue to ensure we provide the supports and services best suited to the needs of enterprise over the coming months. </p><p>The information is set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Uptake (as of 19 November 2018)</th><th>Allocation/Expenditure by year up to 19 November 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td><td>307 applications received, 270 approved by SBCI, 54 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;12.51 million (23 November 2018)</td><td>&euro;23 million exchequer funding has   been used to leverage a fund of up to &euro;300 million: &euro;14 million from DBEI and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This Exchequer funding was allocated to the SBCI at   the end of 2017.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland (EI) Brexit Scorecard - online platform for   Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit</td><td>3,332 Brexit Scorecards have been completed, which   includes 502 LEOs clients </td><td><br /><br />2017 Expenditure: &euro;25,568<br /><br />2018 Expenditure: &euro;11,261<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>EI Be Prepared Grant</td><td>148 Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td><td>2017 Expenditure: &euro;10,000<br /><br />2018 Expenditure: &euro;154,573</td></tr><tr><td>EI Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new markets</td><td>166 projects have been approved under this   initiative</td><td>Market Discovery fund was launched in 2018   <br /><br />2018 Expenditure: &euro;165,470</td></tr><tr><td>EI Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to   innovation funding</td><td>33 Agile Innovation projects have been approved</td><td>Agile Innovation Fund was launched in 2018 <br /><br />2018 Expenditure: &euro;263,681</td></tr><tr><td>EI Brexit Advisory Clinics</td><td>11 events been run with approx. 915 in attendance</td><td><br /><br />2017 Expenditure: &euro;57,797<br /><br />2018 Expenditure: &euro;144,567</td></tr><tr><td>EI Brexit &lsquo;Act On Programme&rsquo;

First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. This application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form. As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. Guidance is available on the SBCI website on how to complete a business plan.  The SBCI assess the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank.  Approval of loans under the Brexit Loan Scheme is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures. </p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March this year and, as of 23 November, there have been 307 applications received, of which 270 have been approved and 54 loans progressed to sanction at finance provider level to a value of &euro;12.51 million.

Guidance is available on the SBCI website on how to complete a business plan.  The SBCI assess the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p><p>Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank.  Approval of loans under the Brexit Loan Scheme is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures.</p><p>The scheme was launched in March this year and, as of 23 November, there have been 307 applications received, with 270 deemed eligible and 54 loans progressed to sanction at finance provider level to a value of &euro;12.51 million.  This equates to an average loan value of approximately &euro;231,700. These figures were issued as an interim update from the SBCI.  </p><p>The SBCI issues a detailed report on a quarterly basis, which includes county level breakdown and sector breakdown.

The first study measuring the number of people who are on this spectrum in Ireland was completed in 2016 by researchers at DCU, but did not include metrics on employment.  My Department has consulted with the Central Statistics Office and Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Health and Justice and Equality who do not have such data.  This data cannot be fully captured by any Department or body as employees do not have to inform their employer that they are on this spectrum and indeed may not be aware that they are on it. Both the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Justice and Equality have policy responsibility in relation to the employment of people with disabilities and a number of policy documents have been published such as, Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities 2017, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024 and the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.</p></reply>

The Inspectors are now in situ and are due to produce their first report to the High Court in April 2019.</p><p>Other civil enforcement actions, i.e., applications for the disqualification of the directors of insolvent companies that have been struck off the register, are dealt with under the response to question reference 49281/18.</p><p>Criminal enforcement &ndash; summary prosecutions</p><p>The ODCE is only empowered to initiate summary prosecutions (i.e., in the District Court). Only the Director of Public Prosecutions (&ldquo;DPP&rdquo;) can initiate a prosecution on indictment (i.e., in the Circuit Criminal Court before a jury).</p><p>Summary prosecutions are only suitable for relatively minor matters and, as such, the ODCE typically seeks to resolve issues of underlying non-compliance by other, more cost, effective means such as, for example, by issuing warning letters, by requiring evidence of rectification and/or issuing statutory directions requiring the taking of certain actions. Consequently, and consistent with its strategic focus on deploying finite specialist resources (i.e., Garda, accounting, legal and digital forensics) towards more serious indications of wrongdoing, the ODCE did not initiate any summary prosecutions in the District Court over the period 2017 to 2018.</p><p>Referrals to the DPP</p><p>Investigations into more serious indications of wrongdoing will typically result in a file being submitted to the DPP for consideration as to whether charges should be directed on indictment. Whether charges are directed is solely a matter for the DPP.</p><p>During the period covered by the question, i.e., 2017 and 2018, the ODCE submitted files to the DPP for consideration as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Files submitted</td><td>5</td><td>0 (YTD)</td></tr></table></p><p>Directions to charge on indictment</p><p>Once an investigation file is submitted to the DPP, the timeframe within which a decision is taken as to whether to charge or not is outside the ODCE&rsquo;s control. In complex cases, it is not unusual for the DPP to seek advices on proofs from Counsel prior to making such a decision.</p><p>Where the DPP directs charges on indictment, the matter enters the Courts system where the timing is, similarly, outside the ODCE&rsquo;s control. During the period covered by the question, i.e., 2017 and 2018, the DPP directed charges on foot of ODCE files as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Charges directed</td><td>1 alleged offence of Fraudulent Trading</td><td>1 alleged offence of Fraudulent Trading<br /><br /> <br /><br />6 alleged offences of Money Laundering <br /><br /> <br /><br />1 alleged offence of the Use of a False Instrument</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Since his appointment, the current Director has undertaken a significant restructuring of the ODCE to better reflect the organisation&rsquo;s needs in the context of both its strategic shift towards deploying resources towards more serious indications of wrongdoing and the increasingly complex environment within which the ODCE operates. </p>  <p>  That restructuring has included the seeking of sanction for the recruitment of a substantial number of additional professional staff, and following receipt of sanction, the recruitment of eight accounting professionals, three legal professionals and a digital forensics professional, together with significant investment in a digital forensics laboratory, training and development. The recruitment and assimilation of a large number of new professional staff into a multi-disciplinary organisation that undertakes complex work in a fast-moving environment is a project that requires careful management. As such, the Director is of the view that it is preferable to allow that process to fully bed down before filling the aforementioned vacancy. The Director is further conscious of the fact that the transition of the ODCE to a stand-alone Agency will give rise to additional expertise requirements and, as such, is of the view that it is prudent that those considerations should be factored into developing the role, and associated skill set, required of the appointee.</p>  <p>  As part of the annual budgetary process, the ODCE has sought additional funding in respect of 2019. This additional funding request is related primarily to the recent appointment by the President of the High Court of Inspectors to Independent News &amp;amp; Media plc. Under the Companies Act 2014, the costs associated with the Inspectorship are met, in the first instance, by the ODCE. Additional funding was also sought to reflect the likely costs associated with the transition of the ODCE into an independent Agency. An additional &euro;1m was provided for the ODCE in the Budget announced on 9 October 2018.</p></reply>

My Department works closely with its agencies to fund climate change related research and to deliver environmental performance improvement programmes which directly assist enterprise in reducing emissions and improving energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  Climate change adaptation and mitigation measures are a central part of our policy considerations and are a key factor when developing new initiatives. For example, the Future Jobs initiative is the Government's new plan and programme of action for the next phase of Ireland's economic development. The initiative is being developed jointly by my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach and we expect to launch the initiative early next year. One of the key areas being considered under the initiative is adaptation to the &lsquo;Low Carbon Economy&rsquo; and how enterprises can innovate and adapt to succeed in a low carbon economy. The initiative recognises that climate change impacts how we do business and requires a change to production and consumption methods.</p>  <p>  My Department is administering the Government&rsquo;s new &euro;500m Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund, one of four funds in the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  Applications under the fund must align with research priority areas which include climate action related areas such as &ldquo;Decarbonising the Energy System&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sustainable Living&rdquo;.  Applications under the first funding call are currently being considered. </p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology, contains a series of actions to promote research and innovation in climate change related areas.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initiatives being developed and implemented by my Department, the enterprise sector continues to participate in emission reduction efforts with accompanying obligations to reduce emissions.  Irish enterprises' main contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is through the European Union Emissions Trading System which includes approximately one hundred installations of Ireland&rsquo;s largest energy users, who account for more than 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions.  The Emissions Trading System operates on a &ldquo;cap and trade&rdquo; basis, with the cap continuously reducing over time.  Under Phase IV of the System which will commence in 2021, the sectors covered by EU ETS must reduce their emissions by 43% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.</p>  <p>  Two hundred of Ireland&rsquo;s largest energy users are members of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s Large Industry Energy Network. Estimated energy savings of over 10% were achieved by network members in 2017 and over 300 projects were implemented covering a wide range of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.</p>  <p>  A number of companies are availing of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland initiatives such as the &ldquo;Lighting Support Scheme for SMEs&rdquo; and the Excellence in Energy Efficient Design, which incorporate energy efficiency into design projects.  Enterprises continue to avail of the Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Energy Efficient Equipment to assist them in their purchase of highly energy efficient equipment.</p>  <p>  In terms of my Department&rsquo;s agency initiatives in the area of climate change, Science Foundation Ireland funds climate action related research in areas such climate change mitigation and renewable energy. </p>  <p>  IDA&rsquo;s Environmental Aid Programme assists client companies to implement major renewable energy or energy efficiency initiatives or address other environmental issues such as waste reduction.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supports companies to improve their environmental performance, drive environmental efficiencies and achieve improved sustainability.</p></reply>

CervicalCheck laboratory activity has since been significantly above normal levels. This is as a result both of these out of cycle smears and increased uptake generally, and has impacted turnaround times for results of smear tests. This is a priority concern for my Department. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that, currently, receipt of results of smear tests may take up to 20 weeks, that it may take longer in a small number of cases, and that it is working closely with laboratories to address this issue. </p>  <p>  Smear test samples must be sent to the laboratory and made into slides within six weeks of the smear test date. After six weeks, the sample is deemed expired and cannot be processed. In some cases, the increased volume has resulted in a delay transferring samples to slides. The HSE has advised that, since 30 July 2018, the majority of smear test samples are now transferred to slides within the six-week timeframe. The HSE has further advised that, in October 2017, there was a 0.25% rate of expired samples and vials. For the same period in 2018 the rate was 0.29%. Additionally, in some cases a sample may be insufficient. </p>  <p>  Although every effort is made to avoid these situations from happening, it is inevitable that cervical screening programmes will sometimes encounter these issues. In such cases, a woman and her GP are advised of the need for a repeat test in three months&rsquo; time by letter from CervicalCheck. </p>  <p>  In regard to the specific details sought in relation to numbers of slides, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-27a.931.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112700081#WRS04700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 to 387, inclusive, and 462 to 465, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The national Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) established under the Chair of the Department of Health, is comprised of individuals from a range of Government Departments and Agencies.  It is providing oversight to the implementation of the recommendations of the national Obesity Policy &amp;amp; Action Plan (OPAP).  At its next meeting, the OPIOG will consider the Report on Tackling Childhood Obesity from the Joint Oireachtas  Committee on Children and Youth Affairs for the purposes of, among others, aligning both sets of recommendations.  In the meantime, the preparation of a Progress Report on the implementation of OPAP is continuing so that it can be considered at this next OPIOG meeting.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the OPIOG agreed to establish a sub-group for Reformulation earlier this year.  This sub-group has met on a number of occasions since being established and agreed their Terms of Reference.  The Reformulation sub-group is technical in its work programme.  The work of the sub-group will primarily set targets on reformulation of food and drink. It will also make recommendations on addressing reduction of portion sizes and on monitoring and validation procedures.  As part of its work, a workshop between the Reformulation sub-group and Food Sector Stakeholders on reformulation took place on 20 September last.  This workshop provided an important opportunity for detailed engagement with key Food Sector Stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities of reformulation in the interests of promoting the health and well-being of the population.  And the work of the sub-group will now build on this engagement.</p>  <p>  The report of the sub-group, which is anticipated to be finalised in the first half of next year, will among other things, explore approaches and make recommendations to address reducing portion sizes along with considering options for implementing recommendations in particular, monitoring and validation procedures.</p>  <p>  While there are no plans at this juncture to establish any additional sub-groups along the lines referred to by the Deputy, the Chair of the OPIOG keeps such questions under review.</p>  <p>  The commencement of the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax on 1 May last was in line with one of the recommendations in the OPAP.  It represents a positive step in our national policy to deal with the problem of obesity.  Work on the development of an evaluation framework for this tax is well underway and I anticipate that this framework will be well advanced by early next year.  In addition, Codes of Practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship were developed involving representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments.  It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The Codes of Practice concerned were published in February.  Earmarking a process for monitoring the Codes and the development of a related process to agree guidance for supporting them are continuing.</p>  <p>  Finally, a number of Government policies aim to support the design and development of built environments that enhance health, wellbeing and quality of life for all.  The National Physical Activity Plan (NPAP) and OPAP both require that joint action is taken to promote the importance of physical activity and to reduce the obesogenic nature of the built environment. </p>  <p>  In line with Actions 31 of the NPAP and 2.1 of the OPAP, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity, and Action 59 of the NPAP which commits to developing a programme of on-going stakeholder communication and engagement, a Stakeholder Forum was held on the 21 November last. </p>  <p>  The event was planned in partnership, with substantial input from three Government Departments, (Health; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Housing, Planning and Local Government) and was hosted in the National Indoor Arena, Sport Ireland National Sports Campus, Abbottstown.  I am pleased to note that the event was well attended with 125 delegates.</p>  <p>  This Forum, entitled Connect, Collaborate, Create; Co-Designing Healthier Communities, A Healthy Ireland Stakeholder Forum on the Built Environment, brought together those who have a responsibility for planning and developing public spaces with those who have expertise regarding the impacts of the built environment on health and wellbeing, sport and physical activity.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to address this Forum together with my colleague Simon Harris T.D., Minister for Health, and the CEO of Sport Ireland, John Treacy.  Sessions were chaired by officials from the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Health. Expert presentations were given regarding optimal design of healthier communities, the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS) and the new Town and Village Toolkit, which is about to be launched by the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland (RIAI).</p>  <p>  Presentations were also given by Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council on the lessons learned from the success of the Waterford Greenway, and on the development of the No Fry Zone initiative in Greystones, Co. Wicklow which aims to place limits on the proximity of fast food outlets to schools. </p>  <p>  The talks were followed by a workshop and discussion. Written feedback was gathered from all participant groups and is in the process of collation.  These collated outcomes will be considered in detail by the relevant Departments, the National Physical Activity Plan Implementation Group and OPIOG for the purposes of advancing our work in the area of health and environmental planning.</p></reply>

The report made several recommendations, the vast majority of which focused on the internal team working and clinical governance issues at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children's Hospital Crumlin.  The report resulted in 56 actions to be undertaken by the HSE and Crumlin Hospital.  The HSE has confirmed that 31 of these actions have been implemented and 16 are currently being implemented.  </p>  <p>  An external multi professional team, led by an experienced NHS UK Health Manager, has been assisting the Department of Clinical Genetics at Crumlin to deliver an improved service for patients and clinical service users.  There continues to be investments in the recruitment of extra staff resources and the purchase of new equipment to assist with the implementation of improvements to the service.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Donnai-Newman Report was that a Steering Group should be set up to develop a National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network that reflects best international practice.  This Steering Group was established by the HSE in early 2015.  Their report included recommending the appointment of a National Director of the National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network and a Clinical Laboratory Director.  The HSE National Service Plan 2018 includes a commitment to commence development of the National Genetics and Genomic Network.  These key posts, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, will inform the development of the national strategic direction for genetic and genomic medicine services, including genetic  services.</p></reply>

While Milford has continuously offered excellent palliative care for 40 years, it was recognised that the previous hospice unit no longer met best practice in maintaining the dignity and privacy of patients and their families. A new hospice building was designed to meet changing needs in palliative care and I share the Minister's confidence that the new building will meet the palliative care needs of the people of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary for a long time to come.</p>  <p>  Over the last five years, the Government has increased the number of specialist palliative care beds across the country by 50%. We are proud of this achievement, but recognise that many people do not have access to a specialist palliative care unit in their region. National palliative care policy seeks to ensure that there is a hospice serving every region in the country. Although good progress has been made on national policy recommendations, it is acknowledged that there are regions which still do not have access to specialist palliative inpatient care beds. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to prepare the 2019 National Service Plan. This process is ongoing. The Department has asked the HSE to consider options for opening the additional four beds in 2019 having regard to the provision of palliative care services across the country within the overall envelope of resources available.</p></reply>

All residential care homes must have processes and procedures in place for dealing with complaints.  The person in charge of the home can provide assistance on how to make a complaint. </p>  <p>  Complaints on issues may also be made to the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) as the statutory independent regulator for the nursing home sector and this responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards. As a regulator HIQA has no formal legal role in examining individual complaints. However, the Authority does take into account all information it receives, including complaints from the public, when carrying out inspections.   </p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman, as an independent body, can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p>  <p>  As such, there is already a well-established complaints/review process including, where required, an independent body which can consider any related issues. This is the appropriate process for considering these matters. As noted previously a review of all instances of restrictions is underway in the HSE. There are 11 such cases across mental health and older people services. This is in the context of currently providing some 7,000 beds across those services.</p></reply>

A range of recommendations for action by the HSE in collaboration with other stakeholders is identified, to provide assurance that the use of mesh implants and the care of women requiring aftercare in Irish hospitals is in line with emerging evidence and best practice internationally, based on expert advice received and review of international experience. </p><p><b>Methodology</b></p><p>Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report has been informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.</p><p>I wish to acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown, by the women that met with me and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were harrowing, deeply personal experiences. </p><p>It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, have not been formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, as described in Section 2, a number of women whose procedures were postponed made representations to the Department expressing concern at the impact that this has on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.</p><p><b>Report Findings</b></p><p>The report makes a number of overall findings, in addition findings are presented which relate to informed consent, aftercare of women with complications, clinical and professional issues and information issues. The findings are:</p><p>Overall Findings</p><p>- Mesh implant devices are certified as compliant with relevant European Union (EU) legislation and no market action against mesh devices for the treatment of SUI or POP has been taken by any of the European device regulatory competent authorities.  </p><p>- There is an extensive evidence base supporting (i) the use of the mid-urethral sling (MUS) devices in the treatment of SUI and (ii) the use of abdominally placed mesh in the management of POP. A significant majority of patients benefit greatly from these procedures, with reduced long-term complications and improved functional outcomes compared to non-mesh procedures. </p><p>- Mesh procedures should be performed by trained personnel, in patients who are appropriately selected and counselled and when appropriate multidisciplinary expertise and clinical governance mechanisms are in place.</p><p>- Transvaginal placement of mesh for the treatment of POP is no longer regarded as appropriate first line treatment. Its use is restricted by clinical guidance in some jurisdictions. Regulatory restrictions on its use are in place in Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>- Mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p><p>- Many other health systems, including the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and the Netherlands have implemented specific measures in recent years to ensure appropriate use of mesh procedures in the treatment of SUI and POP and to ensure appropriate aftercare for women suffering mesh complications.</p><p>Informed Consent </p><p>- As would be usual with many surgical conditions, standardised information resources were not available at national level to ensure that all patients receive consistent information about the benefits and risks of mesh devices, to advise of other treatment options and to support informed consent processes.</p><p>- Many women reported that they were not informed of other treatment options; they had not been informed that their surgeries involved the use of mesh; they were not informed of mesh complications; and they were not made aware of the difficulties associated with mesh removal or with the treatment of long-term mesh complications. </p><p>Aftercare of Women with Complications</p><p>- Structured treatment or referral pathways were not evidently in place for the minority of women requiring specialist, multidisciplinary care for serious complications following mesh surgery. </p><p>- Some women reported considerable difficulty in accessing timely, compassionate and appropriate specialist aftercare for complications. </p><p>- Some women reported that individual clinicians responded to their personal concerns in an inappropriate manner which greatly added to their distress. Women also reported feeling that they were not believed, or that their clinicians minimised or did not understand the severity of their complications.  </p><p><b>Clinical and Professional Issues </b></p><p>- Governance mechanisms are not in place at national level to provide assurance that mesh surgeries are carried out in accordance with agreed international best practice and clinical guidance.</p><p>- There is no mandated professional clinical guidance at national level to guide the use of mesh implants in the management of SUI or POP or to guide the management of women with complications. </p><p>- Communication mechanisms currently in place at national level between the HPRA, healthcare providers and professional bodies do not provide assurance that the findings and recommendations of safety reviews such as those circulated by the HPRA in recent years regarding mesh implants are systematically analysed and acted upon where appropriate.</p><p>Information</p><p>- There are significant gaps in knowledge about current practice in Ireland regarding the use of urogynaecological mesh implants. </p><p>- Routinely collected clinical information at national level does not provide the capacity for monitoring or audit of mesh surgeries for the treatment of SUI and POP.</p><p>- Based on international experience, there is under-reporting of adverse events relating to mesh surgeries by clinicians to both the HPRA and to the National Incident Management System (NIMS) operated by the State Claims Agency (SCA). </p><p><b>Recommendations</b></p><p>Nineteen recommendations in total are identified throughout the report in response to the findings above:</p><p>- Patient Information and Consent - 2 recommendations;</p><p>- Aftercare for Women Suffering Complications - 5 recommendations;</p><p>- Clinical and Professional Recommendations - 8 recommendations;</p><p>- Information Recommendations - 5 recommendations.</p><p>These include recommendations about the development of patient information and informed consent materials to ensure appropriate patient selection and counselling, ensuring clinical and professional standards of practice are met by ensuring that all surgeons have undergone appropriate surgical professional training and ensuring that appropriate multidisciplinary expertise is available in units carrying out mesh procedures, the development of clinical guidance for the management of SUI and POP, the development of information resources to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices and to permit long-term research and audit of practice, ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications, and ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications. </p><p>Full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations will provide significant assurance that all patients presenting for treatment for SUI and POP and all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, patient centred care in accordance with accepted evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms. </p><p><b>Actions to date</b></p><p>A number of important interim system actions to address the safety and effectiveness of mesh implant use have been progressed in advance of completion of the report.</p><p><i>1.  Pause on all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures</i></p><p>On 24 July 2018, the HSE was requested by the CMO to pause all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals. The request to institute a pause in vaginal mesh procedures was considered proportionate and necessary to address public and patient concern about the ongoing safety of mesh devices as comprehensively as possible. </p><p><i>2.  Development of patient information and consent materials</i></p><p>Prior to this request, in May 2018, the HSE had been requested to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. </p><p><i>3.  Learning Notice on mesh devices </i></p><p>A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the National Women and Infants&rsquo; Health Programme (NWIHP) on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website. </p><p><i>3.  Synthetic Mesh Devices Group</i></p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups, to advise on and progress all the interim recommendations as advised to the HSE in May 2018 and in July 2018.  To ensure that the spectrum of views of women affected by mesh safety concerns is represented, the three patient representatives include Ms Melanie Power, representative of Mesh Survivors Ireland; as well as a woman who has had a successful outcome of mesh surgery for the treatment of SUI and a woman who is on the waiting list for surgery (currently paused).</p><p>I am informed that a work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications including access to specialist diagnostic facilities such as translabial scanning is being progressed through this Group. The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad. </p><p><b>Next Steps</b></p><p>As requested by the CMO in July 2018, the pause in the use of mesh procedures for the management of SUI and POP in HSE-funded hospitals is ongoing, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations.  </p><p>The Department will be writing to the HSE to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, working in conjunction with other stakeholders. </p><p>As promised at my meeting with Mesh Survivors Ireland on 14 June 2018, I provided the group with a copy of the CMO&rsquo;s Report on the date of publication and a date has been arranged for a further meeting with the group in coming weeks.</p></reply>

CervicalCheck laboratory activity has since been significantly above normal levels. This is as a result both of these out of cycle smears and increased uptake generally, and has impacted turnaround times for results of smear tests. This is a priority concern for my Department.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that, currently, receipt of results of smear tests may take up to 20 weeks but that it may take longer in a small number of cases. In order to address the backlog of smear tests, the HSE advises that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment and are continuing to provide for overtime and manage annual leave. In addition, as part of ongoing negotiations with the laboratories, I am advised that the HSE is trying to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results. Sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytologists. </p>  <p>  This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE, and every effort is being made to ensure that tests are processed as quickly as possible, having regard to the high standards required for testing. </p>  <p>  In regard to the specific issues raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to him on the specific issues raised.  </p></reply>

Persons can opt to be treated privately on admission to a public hospital, in which case they are liable for the consultants fees and hospital charges arising for that episode of care, whether paid for by the patient or by a health insurer on their behalf. It is important that a person seeking private healthcare is satisfied as to their level of cover and individuals should carefully review their private health insurance requirements when taking out, renewing, or before seeking to make a claim on their medical insurance. This includes which hospitals are covered under which plans. If an insurance provider has not resolved an issue to a person&rsquo;s satisfaction, they can also refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman. The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman is an independent officer who investigates complaints of customers about financial services. Details of how to make a complaint are available at: www.fspo.ie.</p></reply>

At the same time, a more challenging efficiency target of 33% was set for the public sector to demonstrate leadership on energy efficiency.</p><p>  The 20% improvement in energy efficiency by the public sector towards its target of 33% by 2020, has been achieved based largely on low-cost behavioural change measures. </p><p>  The Department of Health has been working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Energy, the SEAI and the OPW via the Optimising Power at Work Programme on energy efficiency measures.</p><p>  In the most recent data available &quot;Health&quot; is shown as having achieved 17% savings to date and &ldquo;not on track to achieve the target&rdquo;. However, it should be noted that this relates to the Health Sector as a whole, and not just the Department. The HSE has been working to address energy usage, particularly in Acute Hospitals - which are among the biggest energy users in the Sector. To put this in context, one large-scale project could deliver significant savings that would achieve the target on behalf of the entire sector.</p><p>  In relation to the Department, it has been participating in the OPW &ldquo;Optimising Power at Work&rdquo; scheme since 2007. This is the baseline year. Overall energy consumption in Hawkins House for the period 2017 v 2007 has shown an increase of 7.1%. This is primarily explained by a substantial increase in gas consumption over the year. A 33.3% increase on the base year was evident. This reflects the condition of Hawkins House and the adverse weather conditions over the period.</p><p>Electricity consumption continued to perform well, at the end of 2017 a saving of 26% was achieved. <table><tr><th>Description</th><th>Electricity </th><th>Gas</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Benchmark Year</td><td>1,140,467 </td><td>1,452,118 </td><td>2,592,585 </td></tr><tr><td>Previous 12 Months </td><td>839,484 </td><td>1,936,005 </td><td>2,775,549 </td></tr><tr><td>% Difference </td><td>-26.4% </td><td>33.3% </td><td>7.1% </td></tr></table></p><p>The Department continued with a range of initiatives to improve energy performance including: </p><p>- Improvements from &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; initiative - with a particular focus on all PCs being shut down at 10pm nightly, if they have not already been shut down by the user. </p><p>- Monitoring of time clocks on mechanical and electrical systems. </p><p>- Monthly energy reporting. </p><p>- BMS (Building Maintenance System) Maintenance. </p><p>In July 2018, the Department moved to an A rated Building Energy Rating (BER) accommodation in Miesian Plaza and it is expected that this will have a positive impact on the target going forward. This should be most evident by the end of 2019 when the Department can compare full-year data in relevant categories.</p></reply>

This transition approach is not based on sectoral specific targets: rather, each sector is engaging in a process to identify and implement climate mitigation policy measures and action to meet the 2020 and 2030 climate targets.  </p>  <p>  A key part of this process has been the development of the National Mitigation Plan (NMP) which my Department contributed a series of mitigation actions and measures for the agriculture and land use sector including forestry . These measures not only focus on the mitigation of greenhouse gases and improving resource efficiency but are also aimed at restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems related to building resilience of agricultural production systems (i.e. adaptation).</p>  <p>  My Department, along with other government departments,  provides quarterly progress reports to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Energy, who are the lead department in this respect. As part of the on-going review, a number of additional measures and actions are developed by my Department for the sector. By way of example, the most recently announced new measures include: Forestry Knowledge Transfer Groups ( sharing best practices in the forest sector), the Woodland Environment Fund (providing access to additional incentives for native woodland planting) and the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot. - This builds on the success of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (measure AF2A in NMP) and is  a new pilot scheme targeted at efficiency improvements for suckler farmers.</p>  <p>   Whilst the mitigation potential for Agriculture is indeed limited, Agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland's climate change and energy targets in the year ahead.</p></reply>

The Offshore Renewable Energy Steering Group, which oversees the implementation of the OREDP is progressing the recommendations of the review and continuing the work of implementing the actions and enablers set out in the Plan.My Department has also developed the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which was approved by Government in July 2018 and it is expected that the first renewable electricity auctions will take place under RESS in 2019. The economic appraisal undertaken for RESS involved comparing the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, including offshore wind, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. Technology diversity will occur naturally as the scheme matures and certain intervention levers may be used within each auction round to promote certain policy objectives such as community participation, community ownership and diversifying the renewable energy mix.</p><p>The RESS has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework. The scheme will provide for a renewable electricity (RES-E) ambition of up to a maximum of 55% by 2030 subject to determining the cost effective level which will be set out in the National Energy and Climate Plan.</p><p>The development and consenting of specific offshore windfarms under the Foreshore Act is a matter for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p></reply>

I recognise the challenges presented by littering and I believe that a multi-facetted approach is required, incorporating effective enforcement, public awareness and education. Educating the young people of this country is key to affecting a long term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter. My Department supports a number of national anti-litter initiatives including, amongst others, the Local Authority Anti-Litter Awareness Grants, the National Spring Clean Campaign and the Green Schools Programme.</p>  <p>  My Department currently provides funding to An Taisce for the operation of the Green Schools programme. Green-Schools is Ireland&rsquo;s leading environmental management and education programme for schools with in excess of 90% of all Irish schools currently participating in the programme. The Irish Green-Schools programme is one of the most successful within the international network. The aim of Green-Schools is to increase students&rsquo; and participant awareness of environmental issues through classroom studies and to transfer this knowledge into positive environmental action in the school and also in the wider community. My Department also provides funding to Eco-Unesco for the operation of the Young Environmentalist Awards which is open to young people between the ages of 10 and 18. </p></reply>

Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement at COP 21 in 2015, the focus of global negotiations has turned to the design of the rule-book which will enable the full implementation of the Agreement. </p><p>Parties to the UNFCCC have committed to concluding this process at COP 24. This meeting will also feature the global assessment of the adequacy of climate ambition to date with the conclusion of the Talanoa Dialogue process initiated by the Fijian Presidency of COP 23. </p><p>I intend to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s National Statement to the COP during the high level segment in the second week of the COP. In relation to the publication of written submissions, Ireland engages in negotiations under the UNFCCC through its membership of the European Union. All Parties to the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement, including the EU, regularly make written submissions on a range of topics relevant to ongoing negotiations. Written submissions are published through the UNFCCC written submissions portal at  <i>www4.unfccc.int/sites/submissionsstaging/Pages/Home.aspx</i>.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in COP meetings provides an opportunity to hold a variety of bilateral meetings with both participants and observers in attendance. While the schedule of bilateral meetings for COP 24 has not yet been finalised, at previous COPs meetings have taken place with representatives of civil society from Ireland, with EU and third country Ministerial counterparts, with representatives of other UNFCCC negotiating groups, and with representatives of organisations to which Ireland provides financial support for climate action in developing countries, including the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, and the NDC Partnership. </p><p>Ireland and its EU partners look forward to positive engagement by all Parties to the Agreement to ensure a successful conclusion to negotiations at COP 24 so that the Paris Agreement can become fully operational.</p></reply>

Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve our national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.</p>  <p>  Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society.

Our climate change targets are national and not sectoral in nature. For this reason a National Mitigation Plan was published in 2017 which begins to set Ireland on a pathway towards decarbonisation. The Plan contains over 100 actions, with defined timelines, that will help reduce emissions from across the whole of Government with specific emphasis on the electricity generation, built environment, agricultural and transport sectors. </p>  <p>  The transport sector has a vital role to play in the national mitigation effort, particularly in addressing national non-traded emissions targets. I am acutely aware of the specific challenges we face in transport where travel demand is growing and fossil fuel use is firmly established. To address this challenge, we are strongly pursuing emission reductions and energy efficiencies in transport across four key strands. </p>  <p>  Firstly, we are increasing investment in public and sustainable transport to support mode shift and accommodate growing travel demand.  An efficient public transport sector is a key priority in meeting our climate change goals.  The National Development Plan has committed &euro;8.6 billion to public transport over the next 10 years to 2027.  Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to providing an alternative to the private car, not only to reduce congestion and emissions but also to enable the transport sector to cater, in an environmentally sustainable way, for the increasing demands associated with growing population and employment.  Major projects planned include: BusConnects, which will transform the bus network in our cities with new and expanded bus routes, greatly improved bus access, designated segregated cycle lanes and park and ride facilities; investment in the DART Expansion Programme; and the MetroLink.  We also have multi-annual urban Cycling and Walking Infrastructure investment underway for our main cities. </p>  <p>  Secondly, we are encouraging a transition away from fossil fuels.  In the 'National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland' I firmly outlined my ambition that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland would be zero-emission capable. To support this ambition and a Programme for Partnership Government commitment, an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Taskforce was jointly convened by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Phase 1 of the Taskforce considered a range of measures and options to accelerate the deployment of EVs.  Arising from their recommendations further investment and incentives for EVs were announced as part of Budgets 2018 and 2019 aimed at assisting all drivers in purchasing hybrid or electric cars, including significant toll reductions.  Phase 1 of the LEV Taskforce is now complete and the LEV Taskforce Progress Report is available on my Department's website.  Phase 2 has begun its work and will consider the options available to Government to support the deployment of other alternative fuels, including natural gas, biomethane, and hydrogen, with a particular emphasis on the heavy duty vehicle sector.</p>  <p>  Thirdly, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme plays a major role in decarbonising the road transport sector in Ireland.  The penetration of biofuels as a share of road transport energy has increased significantly over recent years from a share of 4% in 2010 to 8% (by volume) from 2017.  It is intended that the biofuel obligation scheme will be incrementally increased on a sustainable basis to help meet the renewable transport target of 10% by 2020 as set under the Renewable Energy Directive. The obligation rate will increase to 10% by volume from 1 January 2019; and a further increase to 11% is likely from 1 January 2020.</p>  <p>  Finally, an important role will be played by more efficient standards for vehicles.  Ireland continues to push strongly for better EU vehicles standards, seeking greater ambition in regulations that ensure vehicles registered in Europe are increasingly more efficient and less emitting.  It is through better technology and improved efficiency that vehicle emissions can be decoupled from increased economic activity and population growth.</p>  <p>  It is imperative that we continue to broaden our range of mitigation measures. To this end, in 2018, I launched a reduced EV tolling regime as well as a grant aimed at encouraging taxis and hackneys towards electrification. I was delighted to see the positive EV sales this year with over 6500 EVs now on Irish roads - nearly 40 of which are taxis/hackneys providing the opportunity for a wide range or passengers to experience an EV.  My Department is also undertaking trials on alternatively fuelled buses to further inform future bus purchasing decisions. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments and Agencies to research and develop new sectoral and cross-sectoral measures on a whole of Government and least-cost basis to advance Ireland's decarbonisation policy pathway.  The Department actively participates in the cross-Government climate structures and TRAM group, and three specific research projects to examine the role of behavioural change and the pathway to zero-emissions in the heavy duty vehicle sector are being co-funded by my Department to develop proactive, new and innovative tools to help reduce transport emissions.</p></reply>

The issues raised by the organisation to which the Deputy refers are indeed concerning. </p>  <p>  Domestic violence is a wide-reaching, complex issue, and its effects overlap with the work of many Government Departments. The particular issues raised in the Deputy's question refer to the availability of long-term housing, the availability of grants to offset hardship, and the rate of maintenance payments. These issues fall under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and the Department of Justice and Equality respectively. As such, my Department does not play a leading role on any of these issues. </p>  <p>  Policy in relation to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is under the remit of Cosc, The National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which is an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality. Cosc also coordinates the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (2016-2021).</p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence, whether in the context of the family or otherwise. Accordingly, Tusla has provided funding for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services since its foundation in 2014. This includes rape crisis centres and community-based counselling services for victims of sexual violence, emergency refuge accommodation for victims of domestic violence and community-based domestic violence services. Tusla works, and will continue to work, with statutory and non-statutory stakeholders in relation to the barriers faced by individuals and families to finding a lasting, safe home following experiences of domestic violence. These barriers may include, but are not limited to the issues raised in the Deputy's question. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that in my time as Minister, the resources available to Tusla for these services have increased by &euro;4.7m, representing an increase of over 20% in a three year period.</p></reply>

Thus far, 69 projects have been approved for funding under this theme by Local Action Groups.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides to supports through the Dormant Accounts Fund, through the Social Enterprise and Social Innovation Fund measures, and the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme. These include grants to applicants providing home insulation services, reducing our food waste, sustainable energy actions, bee-keeping and training in thermal insulation installation.</p>  <p>  I have also allocated funding supports to those who are exploring the potential of renewable energy and to local projects in that sector.</p>  <p>  Additionally, programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme support the diversification of the rural economy and the effective use of communities' areas of natural heritage, creating employment opportunities associated with local tourism projects such as greenways and blueways and through funding for enterprise hubs and other projects. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep to review all schemes and programmes we administer to ensure they complement the overall objectives of climate change mitigation. </p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;237 million this year on HHB for over 440,000 customers. There have been no recent changes to the eligibility criteria for the HHB package.</p>  <p>  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or over including former CIE employees do not have to undergo a means test or satisfy the household composition requirement to qualify for the HHB package. Persons aged between 66 and 70 who are not receiving a qualifying payment from the Department e.g. State pension, must satisfy a means test and also the household composition test.  Therefore former CIE employees aged between 66 and 70 can apply for the HHB package and may receive HHB if they satisfy the qualifying criteria.</p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB, e.g. to waive the means test for CIE pensioners under 70 with no state pension, would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  It would also be necessary to consider whether they would be a priority group for the extension of such benefits ahead of other groups.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2014, the decision was made to abolish the telephone allowance. The savings arising from the initial reduction and subsequent discontinuance of the telephone allowance meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. With the improved economic conditions in Budget 2018 I announced a new scheme called the Telephone Support Allowance (TSA). The primary objective of the TSA payment is to allow the most vulnerable people access to personal alarms or phones for security by providing a contribution towards the cost. People in receipt of qualifying Social Protection payments and also in receipt of the living alone increase and fuel allowance automatically qualify for the TSA.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These provisions fall within my remit, and as such, I can inform the Deputy that I intend to introduce a number of amendments to correct technical errors in the provisions as they currently stand.</p>  <p>  There is a conflict in section 92 of CFRA 2015 concerning the definition in CRA 2004 of &lsquo;Act of 2015&rsquo;, as this term is also defined in that Act as referring to the Gender Recognition Act 2015. Consequently, sections 93 and 95 require amendment as they also include reference to the &lsquo;Act of 2015&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Section 99 of CFRA 2015 inserts, in the First Schedule of CRA 2004, the required particulars for registration of details of &ldquo;Parent&rdquo;. The list of particulars, however, is incomplete and requires amendment to add: &ldquo;surname, birth surname, address and occupation of parent; Former Surname(s) (if any) of parent&rdquo;. This will bring the list of required particulars for registration of details of &ldquo;Parent&rdquo; into line with those of &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father&rdquo; already set out in the First Schedule.</p>  <p>  My intention is to correct these technical errors by means of Committee Stage amendments to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, which I hope to see taken early in the new year.</p></reply>

Receiving the maximum rate of JA without a strong financial incentive to engage in education, training or employment can lead to long-term welfare dependency from a young age. As a result, if a young jobseeker on a reduced JA payment participates on an education or training programme they receive the maximum weekly personal payment of &euro;198.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2013 the EU adopted a Council Recommendation to member states on a Youth Guarantee. The aim of the EU-wide Youth Guarantee, supported by central EU funding of &euro;6 billion, was to provide young people under the age of 25 with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a short time of becoming unemployed.  Many of the elements of a Youth Guarantee were already in place in Ireland prior to the EU Recommendation, so the implementation of the Irish Youth Guarantee focuses on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to secure sustainable jobs.  Under the Youth Guarantee process case officers engage with unemployed young people, on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes, which are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. </p>  <p>  The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) which I launched on 24 September 2018 is a new work experience scheme targeted exclusively at young jobseekers, aged 18 to 24, who are either long-term unemployed or face significant barriers to employment.  All participants will receive a payment of &euro;229.20 per week from my Department. Participants whose underlying entitlement is in excess of that amount will continue to receive their weekly payment with an additional top-up allowance of &euro;22.50 per week.</p>  <p>  These policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment. For example, the most recent data shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 12.0% in October 2018.  Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current EU figure of 14.9%. </p>  <p>   The Department is also considering the contents of research undertaken by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, which examined the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities. The University examined the data for 18 and 19 year olds as the reduced rates were first introduced for this cohort. Their findings found positive results noting an overall reduction in unemployment durations.</p>  <p>   Age-related reduced rates do not apply to jobseekers with a qualified child, those transferring directly to JA from Disability Allowance or if their claim is linked to a previous JA claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied. Jobseekers aged 18-24 years who were in the care of the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) during the period of 12 months before age 18 are not subject to age-related reduced rates (this also includes young unaccompanied minors who were in the care of TULSA). The Department actively engages with Tusla and non-Government organisations to provide supports to vulnerable young people leaving care on a case by case basis who are experiencing homelessness or are in insecure situations.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  ENPs can be paid to assist with rent deposits and the costs of setting up home, including to young persons leaving direct provision accommodation and moving into the community.  </p>  <p>  CWS staff have extensive engagement with a range of stakeholders and advocacy groups working with vulnerable people, and, for example, engages in local inter-agency responses to homelessness through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit in Dublin and engagement with Homeless Action Teams (HATs) throughout the country.  The Department also meets with organisations specifically working with migrants including Crosscare through the Migrant Consultative Forum. This is a forum where representatives of NGOs with a specialist interest in issues concerning migrants, meet with Department representatives to discuss problems/issues facing migrants in their dealings with the Department. </p>  <p>  I trust that this information is of assistance and if the Deputy is aware of a particular case where a vulnerable young person requires the assistance of my Department, the details should be provided for review. </p></reply>

Where a person exits the workforce before reaching State pension age they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.   Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years and all recipients of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment are subject to the rules of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Jobseekers Benefit is payable subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. This entitlement is normally paid for nine months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age (66 years) provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions. The jobseekers schemes are kept under review and any further changes, including entitlement beyond the 66th year, will be considered in that context.</p>  <p>  It is well known that people are living for much longer.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every five years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It should be noted that this request is not an application for HAP. Where a customer fails to respond to this letter within 6 weeks, they are provided with a further 6 weeks to respond to this request.  Where a customer has concerns in relation to complying with this request, they should make contact with the Intreo office administering their rent supplement claim. </p></reply>

One of the best ways to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.

These supports include Community Employment (CE), the T&uacute;s programme and the Rural Social Scheme (RSS). </p><p>RSS was introduced in 2004 and provides opportunities for farmers and fishermen/women who are currently in receipt of specified social welfare payments to work to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities.RSS is voluntary and the person applies to participate.</p><p>T&uacute;s commenced operation in 2011 as a response to the high level of unemployment and the large numbers on the Live Register.  It is a community work placement initiative which aims to provide short-term work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  The duration of the T&uacute;s contract is a maximum of 12 months and this ensures that as many people as possible who are unemployed for over 12 months are able to benefit from the initiative.</p><p>When RSS and T&uacute;s were introduced it was decided that the existing network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta &ndash; referred to as Implementing Bodies (IBs) - were best placed to manage the programmes.  T&uacute;s is managed by 48 IBs, while RSS is managed by 36 IBs.</p><p>My Department assumed responsibility for the Community Employment (CE) programme in 2012.  The aim of the programme, which began in 1994, is to enhance the employability of disadvantaged and unemployed people by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities.  The programme helps break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.</p><p>CE schemes are typically sponsored by voluntary and community organisations wishing to benefit the local community.  As the employers, these sponsoring organisations contract with the Department, on an annual basis, to provide jobseekers and other vulnerable groups with good quality work experience and training qualifications to support their progression into employment.</p><p>Jobseekers receive information about all available employment support options, including Community Employment (CE), through the Intreo Service.  They also receive one-to-one support from a case officer and all available and suitable options are discussed. </p><p>Sponsors can also promote their scheme vacancies within their local communities.  At a local level, various methods of promoting CE have been arranged between my Department and local CE schemes, including targeting potentially eligible jobseekers to attend a CE Job-fair, where details of CE vacancies and employment opportunities are provided. </p><p>In addition CE sponsors can advertise their vacancies free-of-charge on the Department's JobsIreland website, .  The process of posting vacancies is relatively straightforward and a tailored video is available online to assist sponsors.  There are currently over 1,700 CE vacancies advertised on the site.  These are visible to anyone who logs onto the site and users can narrow the search by location. </p><p>It is reasonable to assume that any difficulties in filling CE vacancies can be related to the significant drop in the Live Register over the last year or so arising from the much improved labour market.  Any sponsor who has any recruitment concerns should contact their nearest Intreo Centre who will provide assistance. </p><p>My Department will continue to review these schemes and continue to work with stakeholders in planning the longer term needs of jobseekers and other customers.  It remains committed to ensuring that the social inclusion and community benefits that accrue from these schemes continue to be recognised and supported.</p></reply>

The changes also provide for up to 20 years of home caring periods in the calculation of that entitlement, for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting children under age 12, or individuals who needed increased levels of care.  </p><p>The changes apply to those who reached pension age on or after 1<sup>st</sup>September 2012  who were awarded less than maximum rate, on post Budget 2012 rate bands.  The changes do not apply to anyone already entitled to maximum rate state pension (contributory). </p><p>Currently there are approximately 79,000 pensioners in this category.  My Department has issued Information Letters to over 70,000 of these pensioners who are resident in Ireland and the person concerned was one of these pensioners.  The remaining over 8,000 pensioners resident outside of Ireland are expected to receive these letters in December.  </p><p>The Information Letter informs pensioners that my Department will contact them directly with the outcome of their individual pension review, or a request for further information regarding gaps in their social insurance record, if required to complete their review.  It is not necessary for anyone to contact the Department on this matter.  </p><p>Work on examination of the social insurance records of the pensioners concerned commenced in September.As social insurance records are unique to individual pensioners, this manual examination phase is expected to continue to the end of the year.  To date, over seventy temporary staff members have been recruited to work on this phase.  Further recruitment will take place in January  2019 when the first pension reviews are expected to get under way following enactment of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Bill 2018.  In line with this timeframe, it is anticipated that the first review outcomes will be notified to pensioners during Quarter 1 2019.</p><p>Payment of increases, where awarded, will be made immediately after an individual's review is completed.  Given the numbers involved, it will take my Departments a number of months to work through all the reviews.  In all cases,  where the outcome of the review results in an increase in state pension (contributory) entitlement, the increase will be backdated to 30 March 2018 or the date of a person's 66th birthday if later, and arrears will be paid.</p><p>Personal pension entitlement rates will not be reduced as a result of this review.  If a pensioner does not qualify for an increased rate, they will continue to receive their existing rate of entitlement.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These related to (a) reconfiguration of the starting age of DA from the current age of 16 to 18 years and (b) implementing the principle of early engagement for young persons on Disability Allowance (DA) and on all illness and disability payments.</p>  <p>  To fulfil a commitment of the report, a wide consultation was conducted with persons with disabilities and their families in relation to these recommendations.  This consultation began in September 2017 and continued until June 2018 with the final meeting of a key stakeholder focus group (this group comprises of persons with experience of disability issues and has helped the Department with the design of the national consultation process). </p>  <p>  The public consultation process on recommendations 9 and 10 of the Make Work Pay report concluded in April, 2018. Outcomes from stakeholder submissions, four regional consultations (Dublin, Cork, Sligo, and Limerick), and online questionnaires were compiled.

As signalled in Budget 2018, the rate of the levy has been increased to 7% for sites on a local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards.</p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively almost 300 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 140 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim. </p>  <p>  The specific information sought by the Deputy in relation to the amount of the levy that would be raised in particular circumstances is not available in my Department.  However, based on the current legislative provisions and a recent review of the sites currently listed on local authority registers, it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally could be &euro;9m in 2019 (applying the current 3% levy rate) and &euro;28.2m in 2020 (applying the increased 7% levy rate).  The latter estimate for 2020 is based on the number of sites currently included on the local vacant site registers and in respect of which market valuations have been attached to the registered sites.  It is expected that the number of registered sites in respect of which market valuations will be obtained will increase in the coming months which should result in an increase in the estimated levy proceeds nationally for 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.</p></reply>

In overall terms, the key elements of the Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing the  issues in our housing sector are set out in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, and <i>Project Ireland 2040,</i>which set out a comprehensive set of measures designed to restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium.  </p><p>The generally accepted convention is that housing is deemed affordable where households, particularly low or moderate income households, are paying not much more than a third of their disposable income on meeting their accommodation needs.  In order to support households that have difficulty in accessing affordable housing, a multi-stranded, targeted approach is being pursued in the areas of the country most affected.  The measures are targeted at households earning a maximum of &euro;50,000 for a single applicant or &euro;75,000 for a couple.  </p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government has trebled, to &euro;310 million, the funding available for key facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).  </p><p>In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, for example, under the recently commenced provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out further.  These initiatives complement other Government actions which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p><p>The new Land Development Agency (LDA) will also contribute significantly to the delivery of affordable housing.  All of the State land developed by the LDA will include 40% social and affordable homes to purchase or rent.</p><p>While the State is playing its part in facilitating the additional supply of affordable housing, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) are another component part of a more sustainable, long-term property system.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's activity.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, rented accommodation.  </p><p>Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects, provides more stability and less exposure to property market risk and volatility.  Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  Large-scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector required.  The fact that institutional investors are entering the rental market, with a clear long-term focus on their investment provides security for tenants who can be confident that their landlord is committed for the long run. </p></reply>

In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund with a further &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.</p>  <p>  I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home. On the basis of this infrastructure investment, I expect that some 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated in this way. The prices at which affordable homes supported under the SSF will be made available will be determined on a project by project basis. I expect to advise the relevant local authorities of decisions on the first round of applications under the Fund shortly.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the funding system that applies to local authorities is a complex one, as authorities derive their income from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from Central Government.  </p><p>Changes in funding over the period reflect the implementation of various Government policies. For example, the Local Government Fund primarily paid General Purpose Grants to local authorities up to 2014; in 2015 these were replaced by Local Property Tax payments. Also, as a result of the introduction of Irish Water, from 2014 onwards, local authorities no longer received funding directly from the Local Government Fund in respect of the provision of water services. </p><p>Funding to local authorities from my Department&rsquo;s Vote includes programme funding primarily in relation to housing and water (up to 2014). It is important to note, however, that the funding reflects how the Department was configured in the years concerned. For instance, in 2016, the environment functions were transferred to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) and certain rural development functions were transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. In addition, in 2017, community development functions transferred to the Department of Rural and Community Development. Funding to local authorities in respect of these policy areas is no longer provided through my Department but is reflected in the Votes of those Departments and, in the case of DCCAE, the Environment Fund. Also, fluctuations in funding from one year to the next can reflect the funding of significant capital projects which, by their nature, are time limited. </p><p>In overall terms, funding to local authorities from central government (not solely from my Department) totalled &euro;2.66 billion in 2017, an increase of 19.8% on the &euro;2.22 billion in 2016, and an increase of 33.6% on the 2015 figure of &euro;1.99 billion. </p><p>A breakdown of funding to each local authority from my Department as it was configured in each year from 2011 to 31 October 2018, broken down between funding from the Departmental Vote, the Local Government Fund and, from 2011 to October 2016, the Environment Fund, before it transferred to the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment is available at the following link:  </p></reply>

The nature of the problem related to the crumbling of the concrete blockwork in the external walls of affected dwellings, thereby compromising their structural integrity and giving rise to considerable personal distress to the many homeowners involved. At that time, several hundred homes were suspected to be affected in north Donegal. The presence of muscovite mica in abundant quantities in the aggregate constituent of the concrete blocks was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks.</p><p>By the end of 2013, similar problems had also come to light in both public and private dwellings located in west Mayo and Mayo County Council submitted a report to my Department on problems that had been identified with the concrete blockwork in their social housing stock. In this instance, it was the presence of pyrite in the aggregate constituent of the concrete block that was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks. The emergence of similar problems among private households located in County Mayo was also reported in 2013.</p><p>Over the course of 2014 and 2015, there were significant representations, media reports and letters from affected homeowners illustrating the increasing scale of the problems emerging in the two counties, the progressive nature of the external wall cracking and the resultant structural distress in the affected properties.</p><p>An Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks was established by my Department in 2016 and its terms of reference were limited to the investigation of the problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Counties Donegal and Mayo.</p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  Work is underway in my Department on the development of such a scheme and it is intended to revert to Government with proposals for the scheme by the end of the year.</p><p>A standardised protocol was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) on 13 November 2018 and is available at .  This standard can be used by homeowners anywhere in the country to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite and it will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all such affected properties.</p></reply>

The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. </p>  <p>  A first call for proposals under the Fund issued to the four Dublin local authorities; Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth and Cork County Councils, and Cork and Galway City Councils.  </p>  <p>  Fifteen proposals were received, from nine local authorities targeted under this first call. Only South Dublin and Louth County Councils did not make applications under the first call. However, it will be open to those Councils to submit applications under future calls, if they consider it appropriate. I expect to announce funding decisions in relation to the first call applications shortly and for the infrastructure works on approved projects to begin as soon as possible thereafter, with the delivery of affordable homes from late 2019/early 2020 onwards.</p>  <p>  More broadly, all local authorities are carrying out economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites. Guidance in this regard issued to local authorities in Circular letter APH/02/2018 of 16 October 2018 and my Department hosted a workshop for local authorities on 8 November to discuss these issues. </p>  <p>  A second call for proposals under the Fund will be made shortly. The scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities, as part of the aforementioned assessments, which they have been requested to submit by 30 November. </p>  <p>  As to whether the economic assessments will be published, this will be a matter for the individual local authorities concerned as the information contained therein may be commercially sensitive and its publication could prejudice the outcome of contractual or other negotiations with respect to the development of the sites concerned.</p></reply>

There are currently some 27 further rapid delivery schemes, due to yield up to 758 social homes, at various stages of advancement.  Rapid delivery projects generally incorporate prefabricated building elements and as a result have shorter construction timeframes.</p><p>Updated details in relation to the programme of rapid build projects are included in each Social Housing Construction Projects Status Report, which are published on a quarterly basis on the Rebuilding Ireland website; the most recently available report sets out the position as at end Q2, and is available at the following link: </p><p>In order to support local authorities and approved housing bodies, a framework of Design Build Contractors for the procurement of Rapid Delivery Social Housing was established on 6 January 2017, by the Office of Public Procurement.  While the framework, or indeed off-site construction, may not be suitable for all developments or sites, my Department continues to encourage and support local authorities and Approved Housings Bodies (AHBs) to consider the rapid delivery mechanism in the interest of accelerated delivery.  In this regard my Department organised information seminars for local authorities, as well as visits to rapid delivery projects under construction.  Local authorities have been asked to consider, in particular, schemes which are suitable for early commencement, particularly in terms of their approved planning status.  </p><p>In addition, Dublin City Council (DCC) is developing a rapid delivery programme of apartment developments.  This could yield in excess of 700 homes and my Department is working very closely with the Council to prioritise some of the larger apartment schemes, given the current demand.  To facilitate the efficient delivery of these projects, DCC is in the process of establishing a framework of Design Build Contractors for rapid delivery apartment type buildings.  The process commenced in August 2018, with a request for expressions of interest.  It is intended that the framework will be in place shortly.  My Department has supported DCC in establishing this framework and is liaising with other urban local authorities to bring forward proposals for such projects to use the framework as soon as it is in place.  </p><p>In regard to the reported shortage of construction workers, the capacity of the Irish economy to meet future expected activity in the construction sector has been examined by the Economic and Social Research Institute and details of its findings are available at the following link. .</p><p>The recently published report indicates that much of the additional labour required for housing supply and other construction and infrastructural work may have to be secured through inward net migration.  However, the report concludes the Irish economy would not appear, at present, to be unduly constrained in terms of the labour market. </p><p>Increasing housing supply generally, and social and more affordable housing in particular, is, and will remain, a top Government priority.  Through the continued delivery on the ambitious programme set out in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, the State intends to fully meets its obligations to those who need a home.</p><p>Separately, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, continues to implement a range of measures to ensure that there will be the required number of construction workers in place to support the delivery of the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  These measures include:</p><p>- expanding the range of apprenticeships on offer to meet the identified skill needs of industry; </p><p>- SOLAS-funded construction related further education and training programmes provided by Education and Training Boards; and </p><p>- working with the Construction Industry Federation, as industry lead, to further develop the national apprenticeship programme. </p></reply>

It is similar to British Standards and other industry standard requirements for the manufacture of such units.  It sets minimum performance requirements in relation to structure, fire safety, ventilation, energy efficiency, heating systems etc.  This is to ensure that good quality and safe accommodation, will be provided that is appropriate to the temporary nature of the units. </p>  <p>  In particular, fire safety requirements in the tender documents are aligned with the Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety of Part B of the Building Regulations for such buildings. Local authorities will also be liaising with the respective Fire Authority on individual hub projects to ensure adequate provision has been made for Fire Safety.</p></reply>

The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) is a facility, which is exclusively available to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), to assist them in accessing private or Housing Finance Agency (HFA) finance for the purchase, construction or refurbishment of homes that will be made available for social housing purposes under long-term availability agreements of up to 30 years.  Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the uses for which CALF is made available to AHBs.</p>  <p>  This Government&rsquo;s ambition is to make cost/affordable rental a major part of the Irish housing system, with rents set at levels to cover construction costs and the management and administration of developments, but with only a minimal retained profit margin.  As previously advised, this will be informed by pilot projects being delivered on sites at Emmet Road, Inchicore, and at Enniskerry Road, Dundrum.</p>  <p>  My Department, the Housing Agency, the relevant local authorities and other key stakeholders engage in ongoing dialogue to explore how best to underpin and advance the wider roll out of cost rental in Ireland.  This inevitably involved consideration, including in the context of Budget 2019, of the potential role of all delivery partners, including AHBs, and funding schemes (such as CALF).  Ultimately the key funding vehicle put in place under Budget 2019 was the &euro;310 m Serviced Sites Fund, under which the first round of successful applications will be decided shortly.</p></reply>

In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it as a short-term letting, they will require planning permission to do so unless it already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to short-term letting can be sought and it will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners sufficient lead-in time to prepare for and adapt to the proposed new laws. In addition to the making of revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which are being progressed, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals and this element of the changes proposed is currently being developed.  </p></reply>

When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. <b></b></p><p>- In collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment who lead on renewable energy policy, my Department is exploring the potential for enhancing  national planning guidance on solar energy, taking account of solar energy projects being assessed by planning authorities and the scope for future development of the sector in the context of the ongoing development of renewable energy policy.</p><p>- With regard to the built environment, which accounts for approximately 40% of total energy produced in Ireland, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive  (EPBD) sets ambitious goals for energy efficiency and renewables in buildings by requiring Nearly Zero Energy Building or &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo; performance for new buildings from 31<sup>st</sup>December 2020.In addition, the Directive also requires that major renovations to existing buildings are completed to a cost optimal level, where it is feasible.  This has been completed for buildings other than dwellings and will take effect from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2019. It will be in place for dwellings from mid-2019.  These will contribute to emissions reductions from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2021 onwards.</p><p>- Lack of recharging infrastructure is a barrier to the take-up of electric vehicles in the EU and the revised EPBD has new provisions which aim to accelerate deployment.  These will be implemented in regulation by my Department by March 2020.  </p><p>- In relation to social housing, funding of some &euro;116 million has been provided from 2013 to end-2017 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 64,000 local authority homes.  In addition, energy efficient measures have been incorporated into the 9,000 plus vacant social housing units that have been returned to productive use since 2014.  This effectively means that approximately 50% of our social housing stock has been energy retrofitted.  </p><p>All of the measures outlined above are key actions in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s National Low Carbon Transition and Mitigation Plan to address Climate Change. </p></reply>

A draft plan was prepared earlier this year by the National Parks and Wildlife Service in my Department and circulated to the Interdepartmental Biodiversity Working Group and the independent Biodiversity Forum for consultation and review, from May to the end of July 2018.   </p>  <p>  The draft sectoral plan was considered by a stakeholder workshop, held by my Department on the 16th October 2018.  There were 40 participants at the workshop, from across various sectors including representatives of Regional Climate Change Offices and officials from NPWS.  The workshop sought feedback and inputs on a number of important aspects relating to climate impacts and consequences for biodiversity and the biodiversity sector, climate change adaptation actions and also cross-sectoral linkages.  The plan is now being redrafted and the revised draft Biodiversity Sectoral Climate Change Adaptation Plan will go to public consultation in Q1 2019. </p>  <p>  Climate adaptation planning in the biodiversity sector is a cross cutting issue, with responsibility for biodiversity protection, management and restoration spanning multiple government departments as well local authorities and non-State actors.  Nonetheless, I am confident that the work being carried out by my Department, and colleagues across government, will help us meet these challenges.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also involved in peatland restoration.  Irish peatlands are a huge carbon store, containing more than 75% of all the national soil organic carbon.  On average, peatlands are estimated to hold about 1,500 tons of soil carbon per hectare, i.e. about 10 times as much as a typical mineral soil.  Intact  peatlands capture (sequester) carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat and vegetation, but the carbon is released back to the atmosphere if the peatland is damaged. </p>  <p>  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022 sets out how raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and also how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  It is intended to restore all designated raised bogs within 3 cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the current Management Plan.  Work on this programme has already begun with a &euro;5.4m project &lsquo;The Living Bog&rsquo; which is co-funded by the EU LIFE 2014-2020 programme.</p></reply>
