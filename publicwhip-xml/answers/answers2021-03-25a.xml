    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-25a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032500065#WRA00500"><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland operates several loan guarantee schemes on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. These include three schemes with particular relevance to businesses that have been negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes lending available to SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) seeking financing for long-term strategic investment, including in response to the impacts of Brexit and COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in 2019 and initially provided for up to &euro;300m in long-term lending, however in July of 2020 it was expanded by &euro;500m to make a total of &euro;800m available through participating financial providers. </p>  <p>  As of 22 March 2021, 3,246 loans have been sanctioned through the Future Growth Loan Scheme to the value of &euro;675.61m.</p>  <p>  Funding under the scheme is made available through participating finance providers: AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Permanent TSB, KBC and Close Brothers. While the scheme is not fully subscribed as of yet, the scheme has seen rapid uptake and as such a number of the participating finance providers are currently closed to new applications as they process a &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; of existing applicants. That pipeline is expected to amount to further tens of millions of lending through those participating providers.</p>  <p>  At present, Close Brothers and KBC still remain open to new applications under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, which is the largest loan guarantee scheme in the history of the State, also provides for access to finance for investment purposes. The Scheme provides &euro;2 billion in lending, for terms up to five-and-a-half years and offers a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1m and is available to SMEs and small mid-caps (business with less than 500 employees), including primary producers (businesses engaged in the farming and seafood sectors). I would strongly encourage businesses that are seeking funding for investment purposes in order to respond to, or to mitigate  the impacts of COVID-19 to consider this scheme as an opportunity for addressing their financing needs at this time.</p>  <p>  To date (11 March), 3,575 loans have been drawn down by applicants to the scheme, to a total value of &euro;214.73m.</p>  <p>  For businesses seeking shorter-term working capital in response to the pandemic, the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme facilitates loans to eligible businesses as they seek to innovate, change or adapt in response to COVID-19. Loans under this scheme are for terms of up to three years and range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m. This scheme is also open to SMEs and small mid-caps. </p>  <p>  To date (19 March), 1,009 loans have progressed to sanction under this scheme, to a total value of &euro;136.69m.</p></reply>

Following preliminary examination, six of these matters were considered protected disclosures. None of these six were raised by officials from the Department. In two of these cases the matters raised related to the business of the Department and were assigned for investigation by persons within the Department with the relevant expertise. These are finalised with no further action required. In the four other situations the matters raised were not the subject of areas of responsibility of the Department and had been also separately raised with the relevant Government Department.</p></reply>

The measures in the Budget are in addition to those announced in the July Stimulus and include the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. </p>  <p>  These are in addition to financial assistance and other schemes provided to businesses via Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website: Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie)</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2021, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), operational through Revenue, offers a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID of up to &euro;5,000 per week.</p>  <p>  Changes have been made to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the EWSS. The new payment structure for the PUP includes the increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. This change to payment rates will apply in respect of all existing and new applicants. The EWSS is also being amended to align with the amendment to PUP, with the top payment increasing to &euro;350 for those earning over &euro;400. </p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest they contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business.</p>  <p>  The level of support now being provided to businesses across all sectors is unprecedented and ahead of that available in other jurisdictions. Our focus is to ensure the safety of our people and guide our economy towards recovery by ensuring that we have an appropriate mix of supports in place to support workers and businesses in moving between the levels of the COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021- The Path Ahead.</p>  <p>  The Government is very much open to hearing proposals as to how we can help further. Government schemes to support businesses are generally designed to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided, and it is not possible to provide compensation for loss of personal income or profits.</p></reply>

A key action within the National Remote Work Strategy is to extend the mapping and classifications of hubs - as completed by Western Development Commission on the Atlantic Economic Corridor - across the country to develop national data on hub infrastructure. Enterprise Ireland is actively working to support the implementation of this strategy through mapping and classification of hubs; mapping regional and local need to inform future investment in enterprise centres/hubs; and investment in remote work hubs and infrastructure in under-served areas thus underpinning the development of the national hubs network.</p>  <p>  On 20 November 2020, I announced &euro;8.24m in grants for 95 Enterprise Centres around the country administered through Enterprise Ireland. The funding will ensure that the Enterprise Centres, many of which have been negatively impacted by COVID-19, can sustain their businesses, pivot and further develop their services to support the next wave of Irish start-up companies. Enterprise Centres provide important infrastructure for entrepreneurs and are an essential part of the start-up ecosystem across Ireland. The Centres, many of which are regionally based, provide space, mentoring and support to start-up founders and teams, helping them to scale internationally.</p>  <p>  To date, my Department has provided funding of &euro;250 million to support the establishment of approximately 270 enterprise centres throughout Ireland and administered by Enterprise Ireland. This investment has enabled the establishment of physical space for entrepreneurs, start-ups, scaling companies, SMEs and a balance of small scale FDI; delivery of enterprise relevant programmes to companies; and provision of physical space to support remote working.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, Enterprise Ireland has administered Departmental funding to 91 projects totalling &euro;16,434,595 under both the Regional Enterprise Development Fund and the Community Enterprise Centres Schemes. An emerging feature of projects funded under these schemes is the provision of physical space to support remote working.</p>  <p>  Currently there is an Enterprise Ireland open &lsquo;Regional Development Feasibility Fund&rsquo; that promoters, looking to scope out and investigate the viability of larger full-scale projects such as remote working hubs, can apply for. A feasibility grant of &euro;15,000 or 50% of eligible costs, whichever is lesser, is available to qualifying applicants meeting the required criteria.</p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;5 million has been allocated to the Town and Village Renewal Scheme this year to support the development of remote working infrastructure at hubs and BCPs throughout the country and my colleague Minister Humphreys hopes to be in a position to announce details of this funding stream in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The IDA has introduced a number of companies who are interested in the Ballinasloe facility to the Aptar management team and has also arranged visits to the site. These discussions are ongoing. In the meantime, IDA Ireland continues to market the site to both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland clients.</p>  <p>  IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices continue to work with stakeholders in the region to secure sustainable employment opportunities in the West, including in Ballinasloe. IDA will promote the Aptar property to prospective foreign direct investment and indigenous companies. I was encouraged to hear that 60 former Aptar employees had already secured alternative employment by the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  IDA is an active member of the West Regional Enterprise Steering Committee, which works collaboratively to focus on enterprise development in the West Region. The committee is comprised of representatives of various agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the local enterprise offices, the local authority chief executives, the regional skills forum manager, the Western Development Commission, higher and further education institutes, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland. I attended a virtual meeting with the Committee on 11 December 2020, which was focused on maximising enterprise development potential in the West, including Ballinasloe. </p>  <p>  Following on from this meeting, I have appointed a new Chairperson to the Committee, Evelyn O&rsquo;Toole of Complete Laboratory Solutions Galway. Along with the Chairpersons of all of the regional committees around the country, I have asked her to commence with the development of a new Regional Enterprise Plan to 2024 for the West region, working with my Department and the range of regional stakeholders on the Committee including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and the Western Development Commission amongst others. Minister of State Robert Troy will lead on the development of the West Plan and has already met with the West Regional Enterprise Steering Committee on 2 March to get the process underway.</p></reply>

Under this legislation, the first two carbon budgets proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council shall provide for a reduction of 51% in the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions over the course of the first two budget periods ending on 31 December 2030, from the annual greenhouse gas emissions reported for the year ending on 31 December 2018, as set out in the national greenhouse gas emissions inventory prepared by the Agency.

While these years are likely to form the basis of the upcoming changes to the EU Climate Policy Framework, it is difficult to provide direct comparisons to the Programme for Government commitment given that:  </p>  <p>  - the balance of effort (in achieving the enhanced EU ambition) between the EU-wide ETS and individual Member State targets has not yet been decided;</p>  <p>  - many revisions have been proposed to the current architecture; and</p>  <p>  - in determining legally binding targets for Member States under the Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU balances technical, economic, equity and political considerations.</p></reply>

However Councils are requested to prioritise projects which involve strengthening works, remedying road defects, winter maintenance and drainage works.</p><p><b>Bridge Rehabilitation (BR):</b>This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake bridge rehabilitation works. </p><p><b>Safety Improvement Works (BS)</b>: This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake safety improvement works. </p><p><b>Community Involvement Scheme (CIS)</b>facilitates community involvement in the repair and improvement of roads. </p><p><b>Drainage Programme:</b>The purpose of this grant is to promote network resilience. </p><p><b>Former National Roads (FN): </b>The purpose of this grant it to provide assistance to local authorities specifically for the maintenance of former national roads.</p><p><b>Specific Grant and Strategic Grants: </b>The Department no longer seeks annual applications from local authorities in respect of the Specific and Strategic grant programmes. Instead it considers projects on a case by case basis taking into account the availability of funding and the outcome of project appraisals.</p><p>The table below outlines the 2021 grant allocations for Monaghan County Council. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Monaghan County Council</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Restoration Improvement</td>       <td>&euro;6,702,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Restoration Maintenance</td>       <td>&euro;1,121,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Supplementary Restoration Maintenance</td>       <td>&euro;801,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Discretionary Grant</td>       <td>&euro;2,071,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bridge Rehabilitation</td>       <td>&euro;743,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Safety Improvement Works</td>       <td>&euro;255,800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Specific Improvement </td>       <td>&euro;1,350,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Strategic Regional and Local Roads</td>       <td>&euro;100,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Speed Limits</td>       <td>&euro;9,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cycle Signs </td>       <td>&euro;9,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Training Grant</td>       <td>&euro;53,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Former National Roads</td>       <td>&euro;300,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Active Travel</td>       <td>&euro;272,843</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Climate Adaptation</td>       <td>&euro;130,775</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Community Involvement Scheme</td>       <td>&euro;544,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PSCI: Survey Support</td>       <td>&euro;18,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CBGM Pilot</td>       <td>&euro;500,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Reclaimed Asphalt Pilot</td>       <td>&euro;500,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Drainage Works</td>       <td>&euro;524,880</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Allocation</td>       <td>&euro;16,006,398</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition funding applications are currently being sought for climate adaptation measures.</p></reply>

While travels agents and tour operators have benefitted from many of these central measures there is an understandable concern that the travel trade may experience a more prolonged impact on trading than most of the rest of the economy. </p>  <p>  Recognising that, the Government is considering what can be done to continue to support jobs and businesses in the event that restrictions &ndash; including on international travel &ndash; will remain in place longer than any of us want them to.  In that context, Minister Ryan and I recently met with the Irish Travel Agents Association, where the sector made the case for continued financial support.  The proposals made by the ITAA are being examined.  Further, a new Aviation Subgroup, which I chair and which involves both the ICTU and IBEC, has been established under the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) to examine the key challenges facing Irish aviation now and over the medium term as we being to recover.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to doing everything possible to support all those affected by this terrible virus, including continuing to help businesses survive until such times as they can being to trade again.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Refund Credit Note has been an important measure in protecting the cash position of travel firms - who are unquestionably stressed - allowing them to issue notes to the aggregate cash value of around &euro;19M.  These notes are State guaranteed, and consumers should have confidence in them.  The level of overall consumer protection for people booking travel through licensed Irish travel agents is incredibly strong, and looking forward to more normal times such protection should be something I hope people will reflect on when deciding how to arrange foreign travel.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP), as it stands, provides for a gradual increase in funding for regional and local roads and there has been a significant increase in Exchequer funding particularly in the last four years. Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.</p>  <p>  On 15th February I announced the details of a &euro;555 million investment programme for 2021 for regional and local roads and all but &euro;15 million of this amount has now been allocated. Cavan County Council received a total allocation of &euro;15,484,815 for 2021 and  Monaghan County Council received a total allocation of &euro;16,006,398, including funding for a number of pilot schemes relating to road materials. </p>  <p>  Applications have been sought from local authorities (including Cavan and Monaghan) for climate adaptation works on regional and local roads which will make the network more resilient. The &euro;15 million which is unallocated to date will be used to make a further round of allocations in the near future once applications have been received and assessed.</p>  <p>  As regards the Department's budgets more generally, drawdown on capital spending varies from month to month and it is too soon to determine whether any slower than expected drawdowns at the start of the year will lead to a gross capital underspend for the entire year. In addition, as capital is allocated to support specific investment programmes and projects, in the first instance it will need to be determined whether the capital should be &lsquo;carried&rsquo; into the next fiscal year to continue to support the programmes and projects in question.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of their products.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, working to protect insurance policyholders during and after the COVID-19 crisis is a priority issue for Government. As such, it is included within the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, launched in December. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have consistently called on insurers to treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally, and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will recall, both I and Minister of State Fleming have had extensive engagement with the insurance industry regarding insurers offering supports and reliefs to businesses.  We highlighted the need for the sector to respond to both the Government&rsquo;s ongoing reforms and COVID-19 pandemic by lowering premiums, to continue to offer forbearance measures, and to expand their risk horizon in the market. Last year, most of the main insurers agreed to offer a range of common forbearance measures, including a reduction in premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer /Public Liability and Commercial Motor.  Insurers also announced that they would maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings/premises not in use due to these restrictions, for a maximum of 90 days (appropriate supervision and security of the premises is required). </p>  <p>  I note Insurance Ireland announced a continuance of forbearance measures on behalf of a number of its members in late January.  In the coming weeks Minister of State Fleming will again meet with the main insurers to discuss their response to the recently published Personal Injuries Guidelines.  The insurance industry&rsquo;s ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic will also be included on the agenda for these meetings. Both Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to monitor developments in this area and to engage with insurers and other relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

PUP payments are classified in legislation as income supports and are subject to income tax. The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the PUP was not taxed in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; in the normal manner in 2020, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. This approach was based on both a requirement to get payments to people as quickly as possible and an expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out not to be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19.  Tax liabilities on PUP received in 2020 will be collected, interest free, by reducing the employees&rsquo; tax credits over 4 years, starting in January 2022.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that Statements of Liability in respect of 2020 issued to over 465,000 taxpayers from 15 January 2021 to 19 March 2021.

I'm precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market </p>  <p>  Non-performing exposures (NPE's) remain at an elevated level across the European banking system and addressing this issue is one of the key priorities for the European banking supervisor. In Ireland significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of NPEs since the financial crisis mainly through loan by loan restructuring in addition to a number of loan disposals.</p>  <p>  Despite this progress, the level of NPEs in the Irish system remains well above the European average and some time ago the supervisory authority tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge. The banks have no choice but to respond.</p>  <p>  You will recall that in 2018 my Department brought forward legislation to ensure that the contractual rights and obligations of a customer are not altered by the sale of a loan and customers will continue to benefit from, and fall under the scope of applicable regulations, whether with their bank or a third party servicing entity. In this regard - the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act ensures that relevant borrowers whose loans are sold are afforded the regulatory protections they had prior to the sale. All of the customer's rights under their existing terms and conditions will remain in place post transfer.</p></reply>

That is also a commercial matter and decision for individual insurers to make in line with their own risk policies and analysis.  However, if a mortgage lender requires a consumer to hold a policy of insurance related to a housing loan, the lender is obliged to accept a policy selected by the consumer provided that such a policy has a level of guarantee equivalent to the amount that would be required to repay the outstanding credit or to insure the value of the security.  </p>  <p>  If a person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider or insurance provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage or for life insurance, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

However, NatWest highlighted that, at this stage, these discussions have some way to go before final transactions are agreed. NatWest, Permanent TSB and AIB have confirmed that they will provide further updates to the market as negotiations progress in this regard.</p><p>As part of its announcement about branch closures, the news that Bank of Ireland has agreed  a new partnership with An Post which will allow personal and business customers use their local post office for a range of banking services , including to withdraw cash and make cash and cheque lodgements, at no additional cost, is welcome. </p><p>A range of other initiatives are underway that will enhance the sustainability, culture and accountability of the banking sector and improve customer outcomes.  These include</p><p><b>1. The Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR)</b></p><p>The Government intends to further enhance the Central Bank&rsquo;s existing powers through new legislation to be introduced in the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill. </p><p>The centrepiece of the new legislation is the Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR), a commitment of the Programme for Government, which seeks to improve the culture of the financial sector and restore public trust in the sector. SEAR is expected to drive positive changes in terms of culture in the financial services industry and enhanced accountability while simplifying the taking of sanctions against individuals who fail in their financial sector roles.</p><p>The proposed legislation will seek to address proposals put forward by the Central Bank arising from the recommendations in its Culture Report which was requested by me on foot of the Tracker Mortgage Examination. </p><p>The legislation is intended to drive greater accountability in the financial sector, raising the standards of expected behaviour for individuals and firms, in order to achieve better outcomes for consumers and improve the sustainability of the financial system.</p><p><b>2. Banking Union</b></p><p>Development of the European Banking Union began in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The European Commission pursued a number of initiatives to create a safer financial sector for the Single Market, consisting of a set of legislative texts that are applied to all financial institutions and all financial products across the EU which are designed to ensure that Europe has a safer banking sector which can support the financing needs of the economy. Specifically, its rules include capital requirements for banks, rules for managing failing banks and improved deposit guarantee schemes. Departmental Officials attend EU working groups to ensure Irish opinions and the specificities of the Irish Financial Sector are considered in the development of new regulations.</p><p>The completion and improvement of the Banking Union is a priority and recently, the Department completed the transposition of the &ldquo;Risk Reduction Measures&rdquo; Package of reforms which updated existing rules to keep them in line with standards agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. These reforms included new supports for investments in infrastructure and increased supports for lending to SMEs, revised regulations regarding remuneration practices and a new moratorium power to suspend an institution&rsquo;s payment obligations during a resolution process.</p><p><b>3. Digital Finance Package</b></p><p>The European Commission published the Digital Finance Package in September 2020 containing measures developed to further enable and support the potential of digital finance in terms of innovation and competition while mitigating risks.</p><p>The Package contained a number of components &ndash; both legislative proposals and Commission Communications &ndash; including a proposal for a Regulation and Directive on Digital Operational Resilience (DORA), a proposal for a Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and a Commission Communication on a Retail Payments Strategy. </p><p>The suite of measures proposed promotes and enables a more digitalised financial services sector across Europe by regulating emerging technologies such as crypto-assets, evaluating existing legislation such as the Payment Services Directive 2 and the Electronic Money Directive and setting out a framework for a more resilient and stable financial services sector. At the same time, the proposals help to protect consumers in this changing environment.  </p><p>The Digital Finance Package allows for a more digitalised financial services sector in Europe which could in future be less reliant on physical bank branches and traditional payment methods such as banknotes and coins. However, financial inclusion remains a priority and the Commission&rsquo;s proposals include measures minimise financial exclusion such as ensuring cash usage and acceptance across Europe.</p><p><b>4. COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme</b></p><p>The extension of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is a welcome development that will ensure ongoing availability of credit throughout the remainder of this year to our vitally important SME sector who are facing the significant challenges of not only COVID-19 but also adjusting to Brexit.  It demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s broader commitment to ensure that SMEs have the right tools and supports to secure their viability.</p><p>In particular, I welcome the recent expansion in the on-lenders to beyond the retail banks, including 19 credit unions spread between three groups and non-bank lenders.  This extension means that more SMEs will be able to access credit from an increased diversity of sources in both bank and non-bank credit.</p><p>With regard to the provision of financial services in rural areas, the Department of Finance published a paper in 2019 by Indecon Consulting on an Evaluation of the Concept of Community Banking in Ireland (). The report highlighted the large number of post offices and credit unions that are spread right across the country in addition to the bank networks. This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by the Department of Finance in 2018. The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.</p><p><b>Credit Unions </b></p><p>The Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 set out the services that credit unions may provide to their members. These include loans and savings under the 1997 Act and a further suite of services under the 2016 Regulations such as third party payments; ATM services; bureau de change and certain insurance services on an agency basis. I understand that a number of credit unions provide some of the services provided for under the 2016 Regulations. Where a credit union wishes to provide other services to its members, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-51 of the 1997 Act.</p><p>One such additional service includes the Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS). In 2016, the Central Bank defined and described a suite of additional services known as MPCAS, under which approved credit unions may offer personal current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework. </p><p><b>An Post Services</b></p><p>There is a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch within five kilometres. In addition, An Post offers financial services including a payment account, personal loans, credit cards, a range of insurances, money transmission and foreign exchange services.

Ireland has endeavoured to share its experiences from the implementation of the Act with the European Commission and fellow Member States throughout the process of development, negotiation and implementation of the Directive.</p>  <p>  The first formal proposals for the Whistleblowing Directive were published by the Commission in April 2018. Prior to this, officials from my Department provided input into a number of questionnaires and workshops run by the Commission, which helped inform its thinking in developing these proposals. Officials from my Department were also involved throughout the process of negotiating the final text of the Directive through regular attendance at meetings of the Working Party on Fundamental Rights, Citizens Rights and Free Movement of Persons (FREMP) throughout 2018 and 2019. Since the Directive was adopted, officials from my Department have been active participants in the Commission Expert Group established to assist Member States transposing the Directive. Officials have also been in direct biliateral communication with the Commission on numerous occasions regarding various technical matters relating to Ireland's transposition of the Directive. These engagements will continue throughout the transposition process. </p>  <p>  The deadline for transposition of the Directive is 17 December 2021. A public consultation on the areas of the Directive where Ireland has discretion as regards implementation was held last year. Work on an initial draft of the transposing legislation is at an advanced stage and will be published later in the year with a view to enactment in advance of the deadline set by the Commission.</p></reply>

My Department and PAS, in conjunction with AHEAD, are currently exploring the feasibility of a confined competition to create a permanent path for employment in the civil service for WAM graduates upon successful completion of their work placement. </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) Programme is an applied learning, development and socialisation programme for adults with an intellectual disability that was launched as a pilot programme in September 2018.  It is facilitated by the Houses of the Oireachtas Service in collaboration with two sponsor organisations, KARE and WALK.  The goal of the Programme is to provide trainees with the skills, knowledge and ability to gain meaningful employment via the unique opportunity to gain practical work experience, as well as accredited learning over an 11 month period.  Over a quarter of the initial OWL interns have since gone on to secure permanent civil service employment through confined competitions.</p>  <p>  Finally, within my own Department, just over 3% of DPER staff identified themselves as having a disability in the 2020 annual disability census.  The Department&rsquo;s HR Strategy Unit and the Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) support new members of staff with a disability or existing staff who acquire a disability and raise awareness about disability.  New hires receive the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service, a welcome letter from the Department&rsquo;s DLO and FAQs on Disability prepared by the National Disability Authority.  The induction of new hires includes a presentation and Q&amp;A session with the Disability Liaison Officer.  The Diversity and Inclusion sub-group within the PERspectives group, a cross-grade cross-divisional staff forum to support the Department&rsquo;s People Strategy, also contributes to the cultivation of a diverse and inclusive culture across the Department. To mark the 2020 International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 3 December, a presentation to raise awareness about autism was delivered by AsIAm.</p></reply>

The current public health advice is that it is too early to say how and when other restrictions should be eased given current uncertainties. Government will meet in advance of the 5th of April to review the level of restrictions. </p><p>While my Department has not been in communication with the organisation referred to by the Deputy, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing those who rely on these activities to sustain their livelihoods on foot of necessary public health restrictions.  The Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. Budget 2021 also provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. </p><p>With regards to  those organisations that do not qualify for the weekly CRSS grant from the Revenue Commissioners or existing sectoral schemes in areas such as the arts, transport and tourism, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently announced details of the  Small Business Assistance Scheme (SBASC).  The aim of this scheme is to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government&rsquo;s other existing schemes such as CRSS and is designed to help with fixed costs. Wholesalers, suppliers, caterers down 75% or more in turnover and in receipt of a rates bill may benefit, including those that commenced after the 1st November 2019 where their turnover is below projections. Full details of these wide range of supports available are on the gov.ie website as follows: </p><p>I recently announced a new &euro;50 million suite of additional measures to further support those in the Live Entertainment Sector. As part of this suite, an allocation of &euro;25 million is being made available under the Live Performance Support Scheme 2021. This scheme builds on the successful outcomes of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences.</p><p>The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department. The Live Performance Support Scheme 2021 has been opened for applications since 19 March 2021 </p><p>Further details of this scheme and other support measure for those in the live entertainment industry can be found on my Department's website at the following link: </p></reply>

In recognising the challenges associated with delivering a High Performance Programme during the Covid-19 pandemic and the necessity for funding stability, Sport Ireland has maintained the level of High Performance Programme Funding to all NGBs from 2020 to 2021.</p>  <p>  As the qualification process progresses in 2021, NGBs will face additional costs for the Olympic and Paralympic Games that are beyond the scope of High Performance Programme funding and other performance programme resources. Sport Ireland will provide additional support to address these specific needs. A funding process will be made available to NGBs to apply for additional support. </p>  <p>  The International Carding Scheme also provides financial support to athletes for their training and competition programmes. All athletes on the International Carding Scheme in 2020 will continue on the scheme in 2021. Sport Ireland recognises that there remains a degree of uncertainty regarding international competition in 2021. Sport Ireland has accordingly allocated additional resources under the International Carding Scheme to support emerging athletes who have been impacted by the cancellation of major events.</p></reply>

This is expected to create 40-50 new construction jobs across Gaeltacht communities in the short term and the re-developed building stock will support the longer-term creation of 320 new jobs in the Gaeltacht, in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client companies.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Irish Government's Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES), in consultation with my Department, also completed a spending review and assessment of the impact of Brexit on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and its client companies last year.  My Department engaged with both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and a selection of its client companies in order to complete the assessment. The findings and recommendations were considered as part of the Estimates process and resulted in significant additional exchequer funding of &euro;8.1m being provided by Government to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Budget 2021 -  bringing its total allocation to &euro;31.8m for this year. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the impact of COVID-19 on our society and economy over the past 12 months. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 427 new jobs were created in Gaeltacht companies during 2020. There were 7,363 full-time and 437 part-time jobs in companies supported by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta at the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  The majority of the decline to which the Deputy is referring has been in the tourism and related sectors. However, employment remained stable in 68% of client companies while increasing in 10.5% of same. During 2020, the medical device sector saw a 4% increase in employment, with over 700 people now employed in the sector in the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta continues to work in conjunction with my Department and other state agencies such as Enterprise Ireland to ensure that Gaeltacht enterprises also have access to the broad range of targeted national and sectoral measures put in place by Government since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In this context, the Board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has approved over &euro;7.4m of COVID-19 supports to date for over 435 Gaeltacht companies to address financial and supply difficulties, ensure cash flow and enhance their ability to access global online sales markets. In addition, many Gaeltacht companies operating in the tourism and hospitality sectors will have accessed the range of supports for those sectors and for businesses in general which have been introduced by Government since the onset of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is currently finalising a new Strategic Plan for the period 2021&ndash;2025. The Strategy will include the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta vision that Gaeltacht areas should be sustainable communities, with a strong economy where Irish is the primary community language. The organisation has confirmed that it will continue to ensure that effective and practical supports are available to businesses to protect them from the effects of COVID-19 and Brexit. It has conducted various surveys with its clients in recent months to identify the supports required by Gaeltacht companies and will continue to work closely with my Department and other Government agencies to ensure that Gaeltacht businesses and communities are supported, with a particular focus placed on supporting the recovery of the tourism sector.</p></reply>

In 2021, the total funding being made available for the delivery of housing programmes is &euro;3.3bn.  This includes funding to deliver 12,750 social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes. </p><p>My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on all social housing delivery activity under Rebuilding Ireland.

Average costs vary depending on design and type of units (e.g. bedroom numbers, apartment/house). Average costs are also determined by the number of units delivered in individual local authorities. The number of units in the local authority direct build pipeline has increased year-on-year as the social housing delivery programme has progressed. Turnkeys commonly provide fast delivery of units as planning permission is already secured and also provide much needed delivery in locations where there is a social housing need but where a local authority has no suitable sites available.</p></reply>

While not a record of actual delivery costs, UCCs are based on an analysis of returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period and updated based on published tender index information as required.</p><p>To monitor tender cost trends and to inform the UCCs levels, my Department analyses the tender data for the construction cost element of new build social housing schemes approved under the four-stage approval processes for each unit type, where sufficient information is available to allow such costs to be extrapolated and where the information available is appropriate for comparison purposes.</p><p>Outlined in the tables below are average construction costs (incl.

Health supports are provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is primarily a matter for the Housing Agency and is overseen by an Implementation Group comprising members of the two Departments, the HSE, the Housing Agency, local authorities, approved housing bodies and service providers as well as disability organisations. The Group publishes an annual report which is available on the Department's website at  https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/49dc7-housing-for-people-with-a-disability/ detailing progress in the previous year. </p>  <p>  The 2016-2021 Strategy runs to the end of this year and a first consultation phase for the development of a new joint Strategy to 2027 was launched earlier this month, with a research phase running in parallel.

The HDP is the third largest party in Turkey and this step could potentially deny representation to millions of Turkish voters. </p>  <p>  This is the latest move by the Turkish authorities against the HDP, following the removal and replacement of 59 out of the 65 democratically elected HDP mayors, and the recent decision to strip a HDP Member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, &Ouml;mer Faruk Gergerlioglu, of his parliamentary seat and parliamentary immunity so that he may be imprisoned.</p>  <p>  This is unfortunately part of a wider negative trend in Turkey on the issues of rule of law, respect for human rights and the independence of the judiciary. Turkey&rsquo;s refusal to implement the European Court of Human Rights&rsquo; rulings related to the release of Osman Kavala and Selahattin Demirtas; and the decision on 20th March to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention, are two recent examples of the serious shortcomings that exist in Turkey in regards to respect for human rights. I made clear my concern over the Turkish Government's decision to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention and my call on them to reverse this decision in a statement I issued on 21 March.</p>  <p>  The recent moves by the Turkish authorities are especially disappointing as they come at a time when we are seeking to build a more stable and constructive EU-Turkey relationship which is essential for a number of reasons, including our shared interest in issues such as migration, economy and trade, and security.  </p>  <p>  We have been clear that while Turkey has adopted a more constructive attitude in recent months on certain issues, we will only be able to make substantial progress in the relationship once we see a pattern of consistent constructive behaviour from Turkey.

The newly revised school&rsquo;s admissions policy is published on the schools website. It is a key requirement of the act that all school admission policies are fair and transparent. </p>  <p>  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available for the relevant year, the pupil/student should be admitted. This is a requirement for the intake group, any group other than the intake group and for applications after the commencement of the school year. There cannot be a stipulation that a child be a particular age, all applicants should be admitted where there are places available. </p>  <p>  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils/student not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. Schools can use age as a selection criterion should they wish to do so. It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy.</p></reply>

This is available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool/.</p>  <p>  The operational supports include funding of approx. &euro;84.7 million so that schools can employ replacement teachers, SNAs and administrative staff. There is additional funding of &euro;41.2 million, for substitution in primary schools. This funding provides more certainty on the availability of substitutes for primary schools and cover substitutions that are not covered by existing schemes. </p>  <p>  The Supply Panel Scheme for primary schools has being expanded nationwide and over 300 posts have been allocated to provide substitute cover through these panels. The purpose of supply panels is to support schools to manage the sick leave and other absences, including Absence due to Covid-19, by having a supply of teachers to meet substitution needs when required. Schools will also continue to be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel. The arrangements for schools accessing substitution are set out in Circular 0045/2020.  </p>  <p>  My Department has also put in place a number of measures to support the supply of teachers, including the Teaching Council contacting approximately 6,000 registered teachers who were not teaching, to encourage their participation to support the return to school; new induction arrangements for teachers who had qualified outside of the state; flexible arrangements for post graduate student teachers on placement in post-primary schools to take up paid substitution hours over and above their placement requirements; lifting the restrictions on the number of days that teachers on career break or job sharing may be employed as substitute teachers. All of these measures have increased the availability of teachers for substitution.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises that notwithstanding the range of measures put in place, some schools may experience challenges in accessing a substitute in the short term. My Department is working closely with our partners to work through these challenges when they arise in a particular school, and will continue to keep the current substitution arrangements under review.</p></reply>

This guidance was reviewed and updated on 30 November.</p>  <p>  In summary, the overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times (assuming not in use) and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use. It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms.  Managing comfort levels will be easier for schools now than during the winter period.</p>  <p>  In updating the guidance in November, the Department&rsquo;s Planning and Building Unit reviewed the HPSC guidance that consideration be given to installing an indoor air quality monitor in classrooms.  The updated guidance sets out that in the main windows are likely to be required to be open at a frequency and level in the classroom irrespective of whether the opening of windows is prompted through the indoor air quality monitor (re-active approach) or through the pro-active approach outlined in the Department&rsquo;s guidance and that therefore it is not considered necessary to install such monitors in classrooms.  However, the updated guidance indicates that it is a matter for individual schools to consider whether they wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for this purpose or alternatively schools may wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for provision of permanent background ventilation, where required, as referenced in the guidance.</p>  <p>  This guidance is one of a number of prevention and control measures in place to ensure schools are very safe.</p>  <p>  An expert group on ventilation has recently been formed to advise the national public health emergency team (NPHET) across a range of settings. The work of this group will help guide whether any further update on the Department&rsquo;s guidance is required.</p></reply>

COVID-19 related absences arising from pupils/students who have been requested to self-isolate by a medical professional or for pupils/students who feel unwell with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 must be recorded in accordance with the school&rsquo;s normal procedures for the notification and recording of absences. However these COVID-19 related absences should be noted by the school as explained absences. </p>  <p>  In relation to explained absences and in line with the procedures for referrals from schools to the Educational Welfare Service, schools are advised to use their discretion in determining whether a pupil/student&rsquo;s attendance warrants a referral. A pupil/student&rsquo;s absence may be satisfactorily explained by certified illness, bereavement or other valid reasons such as those related to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  In the event of a referral to Tusla Education Support Services (TESS), TESS will take into account the requirement for pupils/students who feel unwell with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or who have been informed to self-isolate and not to attend school. Tess staff have engage with families to provide to provide advice and assistance for pupils/students as they return to school recognising the challenging context for many children and young people.</p></reply>

Tusla have developed a range of accommodation options to receive and provide specialist care for the children. Changes at European Union level in the  procedures for managing the relocation of unaccompanied minors led to a pause in the transfer of all children.</p>  <p>  These changes have been successfully implemented at EU level and Ireland has now received a list of unaccompanied minors who may make the journey here, following appropriate security checking and preparation.  Tusla are ready to receive these children as soon as they can travel safely. Tusla and my Department are working with the Greek authorities and the HSE to progress the safest travel and relocation options as soon as possible, within the scope of current travel and quarantine restrictions.</p></reply>

My Department is monitoring developments in this regard very closely. </p>  <p>  From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:</p>  <p>  -  teaching and learning, </p>  <p>  -  assessment, and </p>  <p>  -   qualifications. </p>  <p>  This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place for these qualifications reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. </p>  <p>  Since March 2020, QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU which have taken place in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers at a local and regional level. The goal of these engagements has been to ensure that, where possible, necessary alternative arrangements are in place to maintain the standards of education and training in this area and that these issues are actively managed. These efforts are to ensure that students can progress in their programmes from one academic year into the next, or, where relevant, graduate with the necessary professional competencies that have been set out by CORU. </p>  <p>  While I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by CORU, QQI and our educational institutions to identify and implement flexible solutions for students up to this point, I am conscious that further efforts are now necessary. </p>  <p>  The current timing and the likely duration of Covid restrictions has created even greater disruption and uncertainty in this space than anticipated and has substantially impacted on the expected level of available social care placements. It is in this context that QQI has been asked, supported by my Department, to facilitate intensified engagements between CORU, education providers and relevant stakeholders on this issue. These engagements are ongoing and are focused on identifying solutions that can be swiftly implemented for the student cohort who are most impacted in the near term while also identifying flexible approaches that can be readily adopted within the system in the medium to longer term as the response to the pandemic evolves and changes. These engagements serve to facilitate dialogue among stakeholders in developing these solutions and, most importantly, will ensure transparency and clarity for those students studying social care. </p>  <p>  Students should continue to engage directly with their provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course.</p></reply>

Student grant applications are means tested on gross income from all sources earned inside and outside the State within a specified reference period. In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income, before deduction of income tax or universal social charge, is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded.</p><p>Widows&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partner's pension are reckonable for the purposes of the student grant means test in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process.</p><p>However, Widows&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partner's pension are eligible payments to qualify for the special rate of grant, and the CDA (Child Dependent Allowance) element of these payments may be deducted from total reckonable income for the purposes of qualifying for same. Also the Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner Grant is an income disregard for student grant purposes and is not included in the means test. </p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p><p>The qualifying criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant is as follows: </p><p>(i) The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant (i.e. the 100% grant); </p><p>(ii) Total reckonable income, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;24,500; and</p><p>(iii) As at 31st December 2019, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in the Student Grant Scheme.  <b></b></p><p>The special rate of grant is payable at the non-adjacent rate of &euro;5,915 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,375, depending on the distance from ordinary residence to the college attended.</p><p>The information requested in relation to the estimated cost of including the widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension to the income disregards is not readily available as it is a very complex query requiring a vast amount of time to manually and digitally collate the potential data for a response in the format requested by the Deputy.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Specific targets have been set to increase participation in higher education by students with physical or sensory disabilities. It is expected that the measures that have been implemented through the Plan, including the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) will assist in the realisation of this target.  </p>  <p>  A progress review of the NAP, published in 2018, shows that the most considerable progress toward realising the targets of the NAP has been achieved amongst the disabilities target group.  The target of 8% that was set for the lifetime of the Plan has been exceeded by the Progress Review stage with a new target of 12% set for 2021.  Current data shows the percentage of full-time new entrants in higher education with a disability is 12.3% in 2019/2020.</p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) provides funding to further and higher education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study.  Funding can be used to provide supports and accommodations for assistive technology, equipment and software, non-medical helpers, academic or learning support, deaf supports and transport.  In 2019/20 academic year a total of 14,358 students received supports eligible for funding under the FSD. This represents an increase of 8.7% compared to the previous year. 987 of these were postgraduate students and 463 were part-time. </p>  <p>  I recently approved a number of initiatives under the FSD aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 23 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.4m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.</p>  <p>  In 2020 approximately &euro;42 million within the core funding allocated to HEIs was in recognition of the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from National Access Plan target groups, including students with disabilities. This enables all HEIs to have an access infrastructure, including disability support services, in place that provides for the pre-entry and post-entry work required to support students from target groups access and successfully complete higher education.</p>  <p>  In terms of access to further education and training, the Deputy may be aware that fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including for learners with a disability. The FET system aims to ensure that systemic and structural barriers within FET to learner participation and success are proactively addressed so that each learner can access the available learning opportunities and be enabled to fulfil their potential within FET.</p>  <p>  In line with SDG4 and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, FET has applied Universal Design for Learning (UDL).

The Fund has a focus on facilitating capacity expansion in areas of key skills need, and leveraging non-Exchequer investments in the higher education sector; </p><p>-  Infrastructure Upgrade and Refurbishment Programme, which is addressing some of the most urgent health and safety issues in the sector, while also upgrading buildings to meet current teaching and learning needs;</p><p>-  Energy Efficiency and Decarbonisation Pathfinder Programme, which is co-funded with SEAI, and is testing different retrofit approaches across the sector, with a view to informing a larger scale investment programme in future; </p><p>-  Devolved Capital Grant which was extended to the university sector in 2020 for the first time in a decade, having previously been limited to IoTs. This gives institutions flexible capital funding to address a range of minor works and equipment upgrade needs. </p><p>Table A below provides details of the capital spend in respect of all higher education institutions for the period in question.</p><p>This is in addition to infrastructure to be delivered by way of Public Private Partnership (PPP), including the Central and East Quads for TU

Applicants should include evidence of their attempts to make an application for a new/extended document when applying to renew their registration with the Immigration Service.  </p>  <p>  The immigration permission of the person referred to by the Deputy is covered by the latest automatic extension  of immigration permissions to 20 April 2021, which I provided in response to the pandemic. Any further extension of permissions will be considered based on Government and NPHET advice in response to public health requirements and restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The Citizenship Division of my Department is communicating with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis. </p>  <p>  Under the temporary new system, up to 4,000 qualifying applicants are currently being asked to complete a statutory declaration that is sent to them by email from the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department and bring it to one of the listed designated officials. The designated official must witness the applicant sign the statutory declaration. The applicant must then send the signed statutory declaration, the appropriate fee and any other requested documentation to Citizenship Division.

The policy is kept under review and a revised Policy is due to be published in 2021. </p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about the number of protected disclosures received by my Department in each of the years 2017 to 2020 and to-date in 2021, it is important to note that a number of agencies under the remit of my Department, including the Irish Prison Service, the Legal Aid Board, the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, have their own protected disclosures policies in place and report separately on disclosures received in line with the requirements of the Act.</p><p>It is also important to note that officials working in these organisations may make a protected disclosure to that agency directly, as well as to my Department. </p><p>The table below sets out the number of protected disclosures made to my Department for the years requested.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Allegations of Wrongdoing</th>       <th>Assessed as not a Protected Disclosure and/or transferred to the appropriate aegis body/area</th>       <th>Closed following investigation</th>       <th>Ongoing</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>-</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (to-date)</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>68</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The number of potential protected disclosures received from workers of the Department during the time period of 2017-2021 (to-date) is 7. The number of potential protected disclosures received from workers of the Irish Prison Service during the period is 37.</p><p>I will revert directly to the Deputy in respect of the question of the number of officials that made protected disclosures over the time period who are now not working in my Department.</p><p>Under the protected disclosures policy, the Department may assess or investigate disclosures through other processes if deemed more appropriate. Since 2018, the Department has engaged the services of independent external assessors and investigators under the Office of Government Procurement Framework.</p><p>Since 2018, a total of:</p><p>- 11 potential protected disclosures have been independently assessed by the external assessor;</p><p>- 4 protected disclosures have been investigated and concluded by the external investigators; and</p><p>- 7 protected disclosures are currently under investigation by external investigators.</p><p>Prior to the introduction of the OGP Framework for the assessment/investigation of protected disclosures in 2018, a majority of assessments/investigations were conducted by the Department&rsquo;s Internal Audit Unit, with the exception of two investigations which were conducted externally. </p><p>Finally, where recommendations are made following investigation, they are communicated to the relevant area/organisation for consideration and/or implementation and reviewed periodically.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business are matters for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that they activated enhanced Covid-19 Level 5 protocols in January 2021, in agreement with the Judiciary. The enhanced protocols meant that Courts remained open for urgent matters in areas of family law, criminal matters (especially cases involving people in custody), bail and urgent Judicial Reviews or Article 40 applications. Non urgent proceedings were adjourned.  Following the Government announcement to extend current Level 5 restrictions, the Courts Service and the Judiciary agreed to continue the existing Covid-19 Level 5 protocols into the month of March 2021.</p>  <p>  In line with the direction of the President of the Circuit Court, Cork Circuit Court family trials are adjourned while restrictions are at level 5.   </p>  <p>  In relation to divorce cases, it is a matter for each Circuit Court to evaluate cases before it to decide how to proceed and whether they are suitable for remote hearing.

A small number of additional cases were held last week to trial the use of Virtual Meeting Room (VMR) technology in such cases. If successful, I understand that more consent divorce cases can be listed.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service informs me that the District Court Judge in Cork is hearing urgent domestic violence applications (protection orders, interim barring orders and barring orders) and cases involving emergency care orders.  The Judge is also taking ex-parte applications and where there are signed consents between the parties, these are being ruled.  Access and maintenance cases and safety orders are adjourned to dates later in the year.  In addition, some additional Court dates have recently been added to allow more matters to be heard and disposed of.   </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also advised that while facilities are not available to hear cases remotely in Midleton Court, a District Court Judge has sat on additional days to the scheduled dates so that the court list can be processed over more court days.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service confirmed that cases involving lay litigants cannot proceed using VMR technology.  This is to ensure that the in camera rule would not be breached, that there is no undue influence at play, or that matters are not recorded.  VMR courts are being used to call over child care cases with a limited number of legal practitioners who practice in this area.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has assured me that the situation is kept under review in light of the current Level 5 restrictions. Any applications for a remote or physical hearing in respect of urgent matters as they arise can be made to the Judge in charge of the Family Law list.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised me as follows. </p><p>The Courts Service has used all available means to keep court users updated on the status of their cases. This includes:</p><p>- Publishing details on the Courts Service's website setting out the types of cases that are proceeding;</p><p>- Using Twitter to communicate with those on social media;</p><p>- Sending adjournment letters to parties involved in cases;</p><p>- Notifying legal representatives of what proceedings are continuing and who should attend court; and</p><p>- Sending text messages or notices to those people called for jury service when they are no longer required.</p><p>The Courts Service advises that the current public health restrictions are effecting court sittings across the country and and the situation can change from day to day, which often means that arrangements change at short notice. The Courts Service makes every effort to give court users as much notice as possible but unfortunately there will always be a small number of instances when communications do not reach the intended parties on time. I am informed that the Courts Service will continue to minimise such cases and apologises to any court users who are inconvenienced.</p><p>Regarding the cases referred to by the Deputy due before the Court on 19 March, the Courts Service advises that the District Court office sent out 147 letters on 16 March, to all those concerned, notifying them that the Court would not be proceeding on that date.</p></reply>

Considerable work is undertaken within my Department to retain staff with disabilities and to improve the quality of their experience within the work environment. Efforts across a range of areas such as role adjustments, redeployment in some cases, additional and specific training, physical work space adjustments and use of assistive technologies have enabled staff within my Department who have a disability to perform effectively in their role and make a meaningful contribution to the work of the organisation.</p>  <p>  My Department follows the Civil Service Code of Practice on the employment of people with disabilities. My Department&rsquo;s Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) is available to assist and support staff with disabilities, in confidence, and their line managers by providing information, guidance, and support, as well as assisting in the provision of reasonable accommodations. My Department will also roll out Disability and Autism Awareness training to all staff this year in line with the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department takes part in the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme every year. WAM is an initiative of the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD), which offers a six-month paid mentored work experience placement to graduates with disabilities. My Department also participates in the Job Shadow Day initiative, which brings people with disabilities and local employers together for one day in the workplace.</p>  <p>  I am also committed to ensuring members of the public have access to the necessary services in order to ensure they can suitably and effectively interface with my Department. </p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 26(2) of the Disability Act, my Department has an Access Officer who is responsible for providing, arranging or co-ordinating assistance to persons with disabilities who wish to access the services provided by the Department of Justice. The Access Officer also acts as a point of contact for persons with disabilities who wish to access such services.</p></reply>

In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis. Further details are available at the following link:</p><p>The next cohort to be vaccinated (Cohort 4) are those aged 16-69 and at very high risk of severe illness and death. Vaccination of this group began in March. </p><p>The ongoing review process will continue to look at the other priority groups yet to be vaccinated, along with the competing needs of those working or living in high-risk situations, carers who deliver essential services to highly dependent individuals in the home setting, and those who are socially vulnerable/disadvantaged.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting our social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoiding non-essential travel until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>On 23 March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;. This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met.</p><p>Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first.</p><p>Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p><p>The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity. </p><p>The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This included increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p><p>&euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of Covid-19, as well as to address waiting lists.</p><p>The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures. It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of persons waiting for both inpatient and outpatient appointments at University Hospital Waterford in 2019 and 2020 is outlined in the attached document. The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) publishes the Inpatient and Day Case (IPDC) and Outpatient (OPD) waiting lists on the NTPF website monthly </p></reply>

The HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) also provides some emergency capacity within the greater Dublin area. Where required, the NAS provides additional resources from neighbouring counties to address demand in Dublin, including motorbikes, rapid response vehicles and emergency ambulances. In addition, ambulances from other parts of the country, which may be travelling to or from a Dublin hospital, may be available to respond to emergency calls in the Dublin area where they are the nearest resource to a patient.</p>  <p>  The Emergency Service Baseline and Capacity Review, submitted to Government in May 2016, identified a requirement for increased ambulance resources in the eastern region, which covers Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. The review underlined the need for a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology. In that context, Government has provided additional annual investment for ambulance services in recent years, including &euro;10 million in 2021 in support of initiatives including the training of additional paramedics to meet baseline capacity needs.   </p>  <p>  As the specific allocation of  resources and emergency response time performance are operational matters in the first instance, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with any further information that might be available.</p></reply>

Vaccination of this group began in March. </p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting our social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoiding non-essential travel until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p></reply>

As a member of PRAC, the Health Product Regulatory Agency (HPRA) is involved in the review of all cases of thromboembolic events, and other conditions related to blood clots, reported post-vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine.  </p>  <p>  EMA&rsquo;s safety committee PRAC, concluded its preliminary review of a signal of blood clots in people vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca at its extraordinary meeting of 18 March 2021. The Committee confirmed that:</p>  <p>  - the benefits of the vaccine in combating the still widespread threat of COVID-19 (which itself results in clotting problems and may be fatal) continue to outweigh the risk of side effects;</p>  <p>  - the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots (thromboembolic events) in those who receive it;</p>  <p>  - there is no evidence of a problem related to specific batches of the vaccine or to particular manufacturing sites;</p>  <p>  - however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e. low levels of blood platelets (elements in the blood that help it to clot) with or without bleeding, including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST).</p>  <p>  The EMA statement stresses these are very rare events. Around 20 million people in the UK and EEA had received the vaccine by 16 March 2021. The EMA had received reports of only 7 cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and 18 cases of Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST). A causal link with the vaccine is not proven. However, because of the rarity of these events a possible association cannot be excluded and deserves further analysis.</p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) have convened and reviewed the European Medicines Agency (EMA) statement in relation to the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. </p>  <p>  Firstly NIAC acknowledges the vaccine&rsquo;s proven efficacy in preventing hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 outweighs the extremely small possibility of developing rare clotting events and recommends that the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca&reg; administration should be recommenced for use in all those aged 18 and over.</p>  <p>  However, in light of the reports of these rare events of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and cases of CVST, NIAC recommends that patients and healthcare providers should be aware of the remote possibility of such syndromes, and if symptoms suggestive of clotting problems occur patients should seek immediate medical attention and inform healthcare professionals of their recent vaccination.</p>  <p>  Healthcare professionals and vaccine recipients should be informed that very rare, complicated thromboembolic events have been reported in a small number of people who have recently received COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca </p>  <p>  In addition, NIAC advises that patients need to be alerted to the signs and symptoms that may occur related to these rare events and to this end recommends:</p>  <p>  Recipients of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca&reg; should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling and/or persistent abdominal pain within weeks of vaccination. Additionally, anyone with neurological symptoms including severe or persistent headaches (particularly 3 or more days after vaccination) or blurred vision, or who develop petechiae or ecchymoses beyond the site of vaccination, should seek prompt medical attention. These rare events have usually occurred within 14 days of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca&reg;. </p>  <p>  In addition, NIAC recommends that healthcare professionals need to be cognisant of these rare events and report to the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA):</p>  <p>  Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia and report any suspected adverse reactions to the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  That a specialist care pathway is established to treat any such cases should these arise.</p>  <p>  Healthcare professionals should seek early expert advice from the National Coagulation Centre about the specialised testing and treatment options for patients presenting with thromboembolic events that are associated with thrombocytopenia, (including Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) or Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST)) occurring within weeks following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca&reg;.</p></reply>

The advice of NPHET is usually provided in the form of a letter to the Minister for Health from the Chief Medical Officer, in his role as the Chair of NPHET. This advice is subsequently published on the Government website. It has set out a consistent set of advices and recommendations that are available for inspection by all.</p>  <p>  The clear advice from NPHET has been and continues to be that our overarching objective must be to suppress the virus to the lowest level possible and to maintain it at a low level. This is essential for protecting public health and our core priorities of education, health and social care services and shielding the most vulnerable from the disease.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  On 23 March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;. This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met.</p>  <p>  Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. </p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.  </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis. Further details are available at the following link:</p><p>  </p><p>The next cohort to be vaccinated (Cohort 4) are those aged 16-69 and at very high risk of severe illness and death. Vaccination of this group began in March.  </p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection.

It is recognised that the necessary public health protective measures, such as the need to reduce social contacts, can have adverse effects on social, psychological and emotional wellbeing. The availability of vaccines brings great hope and will play a critical role in protecting the population, especially those most at risk such as older people, against COVID-19. The advanced stage of the vaccination rollout in nursing homes provides an opportunity for cautious incremental modification in some public health measures, including visiting measures.  </p><p>New visitation guidance was published on 12 March and came into effect on 22 March 2021. The new guidance incorporates early learning from the positive impact of the vaccine rollout nationally and internationally and will provide enhanced opportunity for visiting in nursing homes across all levels of the Government&rsquo;s Plan &ldquo;<i>COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>While the guidance in place had provided for visiting on critical and compassionate grounds this new guidance now expands the scope of visiting on general compassionate grounds as well as further refining the guidance across levels 1 to 5, which now provides at Levels 3, 4 and 5, subject to risk assessment and no open outbreak, that residents may be facilitated to receive:</p><p><b>- Two visits per week</b>, where 8 out of 10 of every resident and healthcare worker in the nursing home has completed their vaccination schedule.  </p><p>The guidance re-emphasises <i>specific</i>critical and compassionate circumstances such as end of life on which additional visiting can be facilitated. It further notes that the duration of visiting on critical and compassionate grounds should be as flexible as possible subject to the ability of the nursing home to manage the visiting safely. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention control measures must be maintained. The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges.  </p><p>It is important to note that nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.</p><p>I have written to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the need for all providers to follow the revised guidance on visitation. I have also met with HIQA on this matter to stress the importance of implementation of the guidance. The adoption of a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the key role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing must be sustained. I expect every effort to be made to ensure visits are facilitated to the greatest extent possible, in line with the revised guidance and public health advice. Providers are also encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.</p></reply>

These letters are available online: .</p><p>There was also engagement with the Department of Health and the HSE regarding the implications of the response to COVID-19 for the health service which also informed the Plan for Living with COVID-19.</p><p>Ireland is developing a National Recovery &amp;amp; Resilience Plan (NRRP) for approval by the European Union.  The Plan will set out the reforms and investments to be supported by the Recovery and Resilience Facility and will be submitted to the European Commission no later than 30 April 2021. </p><p>I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, working together with the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment, is responsible for the preparing the Plan with input from other Departments as necessary, and for ensuring coordination across Government.</p></reply>

In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.</p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis. Further details are available at the following link:</p><p>The next cohort to be vaccinated (Cohort 4) are those aged 16-69 and at very high risk of severe illness and death. Vaccination of this group began in March.</p><p>The ongoing review process will continue to look at the other priority groups yet to be vaccinated, along with the competing needs of those working or living in high-risk situations, carers who deliver essential services to highly dependent individuals in the home setting, and those who are socially vulnerable/disadvantaged.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting our social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoiding non-essential travel until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p></reply>

The NIFF is supported by a network of six Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) that cover the Irish coast. Since their inception, the Forums have developed initiatives seeking to protect the future of the inshore sector, which is extremely important for Irish coastal communities. The Forums involve representation from inshore fishermen, environmental interests, marine leisure, marine tourism and other marine stakeholders. A dedicated website provides information on the work of the Forums: www.inshoreforums.ie.</p>  <p>  Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which provides administrative support to the Forums, has advised my Department that the NIFF held its most recent meeting on 11th February. I was pleased to have my first meeting with the NIFF on 9th December, along with representatives from the Marine Institute, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and BIM. At our meeting, industry representatives outlined the challenges facing the inshore sector.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government strongly commits to supporting the inshore community and the wider seafood sector in achieving its potential. I look forward to my next meeting with the NIFF, at the earliest mutually convenient opportunity, to continue working on how we can do this together.</p>  <p>  The National Inland Fisheries Forum and any other matters relating to Inland Fisheries come under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></reply>

Additional resources have been recruited and training, information and guidance has been provided to both Departmental staff and registered foresters and, as a result, we have seen gains in terms of output.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, we are not where we want to be, which is why the introduction of Project Woodland, recently launched by Minister of State Pippa Hackett, with responsibility for forestry, is so important. This new structure aims to ensure that the current backlog is addressed. The Project will involve a review and refresh of our processes and procedures and will include outside stakeholder participation to bring an independent perspective. It will be a task-driven process, with clear deliverable and milestones.</p>  <p>  Working Group 1 under Project Woodland is specifically tasked with reducing the backlog and then plotting a trajectory to achieve this target. The recommendation in Ms Jo O'Hara's Implementation Report is that this Group publish a process to achieve these targets, including prioritisation and scheduling and that a monthly dashboard show the outcome of this process against the target trajectory.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the changes presented under this structure to processes within my Department will bear fruit, particularly to give confidence to all applicants that they can receive a timely decision on their forestry licence application.</p></reply>

Three additional divisions were established after the introduction of the 2020 Act and they commenced hearing cases on 9<sup>th</sup>November 2020.</p><p>All four committees are currently hearing appeals remotely due to COVID-19 restrictions. Hearings are conducted five days a week and the FAC hear both oral and non-oral hearing appeals.  As outlined in the table below, presently, one Committee sits two days per week and the remaining three Committees sit one day each per week. <table>    <tr>       <th>Committee No</th>       <th>Number of Days Sitting Per Week</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Committee 1</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Committee 2</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Committee 3</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Committee 4</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>To allow for multiple divisions to sit under current arrangements, some members sit on more than one Committee per week. This approach is an important part of the process as it ensures that all Committees are operating to the same high standard and will result in a more consistent outcome across the various sub-divisions of the FAC, which will benefit all parties involved.</p><p>The FAC have considered a number of ways in which the number of appeals being heard could be increased. This may include the running of two or more Committees concurrently and/or increasing the number of cases that can be heard by a Committee in a day. However, the option of running two Committees on the same day is curtailed by the fact that the parties to a significant number of the appeals being considered are the same. If the FAC scheduled oral hearing appeals to run concurrently on multiple days per week, this could negatively impact the parties involved in that they may not be able to attend all oral hearings.  </p><p>The establishment of three additional sub-divisions of the FAC has resulted in a 150% increase in appeals being heard. Given the increase in output, the FAC must be cognisant of maintaining a high standard of process and procedure. While there are no immediate plans to create further sub-divisions of the FAC, the matter is being kept under review and the FAC, in consultation with the Agriculture Appeals Office, continues to review ways in which greater efficiency can be achieved across the four divisions of the FAC, while not impacting the quality of the work.</p></reply>

They include:</p><p><b>- The</b><b>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP),</b>funding is provided to Local Development Companies to deliver work with marginalised individuals, including persons with disabilities and the groups that represent them. Between January 2018 and December 2020, over 530 community groups targeting people with a disability, and some 5,900 individuals who registered as having a disability, have been assisted through SICAP. This type of support will continue over the lifetime of the programme, which runs from 2018 to 2022.</p><p><b>- The Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO)</b>provides multiannual core funding to national organisations that demonstrate good governance and deliver services and supports that have a focus on one or more of the following: addressing poverty, social exclusion, and promoting equality. The current scheme commenced in July 2019 and is due to close in 2022. &euro;18.8 million was allocated to 74 organisations for the 36-month period of the scheme. There are three disability groups funded under the SSNO 2019-2022. They are the Disability Federation of Ireland, Disability Equality Specialist Support Agency Company Limited by Guarantee and Inclusion Ireland - National  Association for People with an Intellectual Disability.</p><p>- Several other organisations funded under the scheme provide supports and programmes addressing a wide range of social inclusion issues, including disability supports.</p><p>- In 2020, my Department has approved &euro;691,231 for the provision of sensory facilities and equipment in <b>public libraries</b>.  This has supported the creation of sensory rooms, gardens and the provision of sensory equipment including comfort kits, Magic Tables and Hublets. These facilities will be used by individuals with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, sensory impairments, special educational needs and other learning difficulties, and those on the Autism spectrum.</p><p>- In addition, since 2019 I have allocated &euro;1.3 million under the Dormant Accounts Fund for library supports to disadvantaged, socially excluded and marginalised communities, these projects included initiatives for those with profound physical and learning needs and also visual and hearing impairments. My Department&rsquo;s Libraries Capital Programme also requires projects to comply with building regulations which legislate for the needs of people with disabilities.</p><p><b>- The Community Enhancement Programme</b>provides small capital grants to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas. Examples of such projects addressing the needs of persons with disabilities include the provision of wheel chair access, ramps/lifts, retro-fitting premises to allow disabled access, and equipment/technology to assist those with disabilities.</p><p><b>- The Community Services Programme, or CSP</b>, currently supports over 420 community organisations to provide services to disadvantaged communities and target groups through a social enterprise model, while also creating employment opportunities for specific disadvantaged groups, including persons with disabilities. The CSP funding is provided as a fixed annual contribution to the cost of an agreed number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions and a manager, where warranted.</p><p>- My Department also funds a Public Participation Network in every Local Authority area, with special representation for local social inclusion groups, including those advocating for people with disabilities.</p><p>- From my Department perspective, it has a designated Disability Liaison Officer in place to assist and support staff with disabilities, and their line managers, by the provision of necessary information and guidance as needed. Staff are surveyed annually to meet our obligations under the Disability Act 2015, in respect of employment of staff with disabilities and my Department exceeded the 6% target set out in Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024. DRCD participates regularly in the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) Programme, which is a six month paid programme aimed at providing work experience for graduates with disabilities. In addition each December events are held in our offices to promote International Day for People with Disabilities.</p></reply>

Two areas were selected to pilot the approach - one at Mount Gable in Connemara and the other in the MacGillycuddy Reeks in Co Kerry.  </p>  <p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe went on to establish a Mountain Access Project Steering Group in 2014, which was tasked with reviewing progress on the pilots, developing signage for Mountain Access pilot areas, and examining issues around a National Indemnity Scheme for landowners.</p>  <p>  In June 2019, a new mandate was presented to Comhairle na Tuaithe which reinforced and strengthens its advisory role in relation to the sustainable development of the outdoor recreation sector in Ireland.  A Working Group was established to make recommendations on membership and working arrangements to ensure that Comhairle could deliver effectively on its renewed mandate.  </p>  <p>  The Working Group proposed the establishment of a number of new Subgroups, including one to replace the Mountain Access Group, which had not been operational for some time. </p>  <p>  At the most recent Comhairle na Tuaithe meeting in February 2021, Terms of Reference for a new Sustainable Uplands Recreation Subgroup was circulated and subsequently agreed.  This Subgroup will focus, amongst other things, on reviewing the Mountain Access Programme and facilitating its expansion. It will also focus on enabling landowners to continue to allow access to recreational users by addressing issues which may be associated with recreational activity.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department has, for some time, been examining how best to introduce a scheme to indemnify private land owners in upland areas who allow access to their lands for recreational purposes.  This is a complex issue and my Department has been advised that an indemnity scheme such as has been proposed would require legislative provision and that a number of separate pieces of legislation might need to be amended.</p>  <p>  In light of the complexities involved, my officials have been considering alternative approaches, including an insurance solution, that might be available to address the matter as an interim measure.  My Department is actively pursuing one of these options at the moment.</p>  <p>  Regular updates on the indemnity issue are provided at meetings of Comhairle na Tuaithe.</p></reply>

The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R areas over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis (NIRSA) at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002.
