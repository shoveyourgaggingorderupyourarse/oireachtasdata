These Regulations allow the CEG tariff to become available for micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. The Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff represents the first phase of a comprehensive enabling framework for micro-and small-scale electricity generators in Ireland, including solar PV.  The Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS), approved by Government on 21 December 2021, will provide capital grants for new domestic and small non-domestic installations, including for farmers. Businesses, including farms, who install new larger installations can avail of a Clean Export Premium tariff which will provide a fixed tariff for 15 years for electricity exported to the grid. The scheme design will be published shortly and supports will be introduced on a phased basis this year.The Climate Action Plan 2021 also commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generators, i.e. above 50kW but smaller than those supported by the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), which will be progressed in 2022 and is expected to become available in 2023. This scheme will enable larger businesses, farms and community projects to maximise their participation in the energy transition.</p>  <p>  For grid-scale installations, including solar PV, supports are available under the RESS, which provides a guaranteed fixed price, determined through a competitive auction, for a period of up to 16.5 years. The second RESS auction which is due to take place in 2022 includes Evaluation Correction Factors which provide for a slight competitive advantage for solar PV projects on taking into account system costs of technologies. </p>  <p>  Other financial supports available for solar energy projects include tax based incentives for the development of renewable technologies such as the Accelerated Capital Allowances Scheme and the Employment and Investment Incentive as well as improvements for farm enterprises supported by the Department for Agriculture, Food and Marine, under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme as part of the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS). </p>  <p>  Planning requirements for solar PV installations on agricultural land are primarily a matter for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. That Minister is expected to bring forward revised Regulations this year to reduce barriers to solar PV adoption. In addition, ESB Networks (ESBN) recently began trialling an updated and simplified grid connection process for micro-generators in the 12-50kW range. Under the Climate Action Plan 2021, ESBN will commence a similar trial for connections in the 51-200kW range later this year, further reducing barriers to solar PV adoption.</p></reply>

The outcome of the audit also provides feedback and learning to BER assessors. SEAI may also carry out routine follow-up audits to check if findings from previous audits have been adequately resolved.  The selection for audit is done on a random or targeted basis and a BER may be targeted for audit based on a specific risk. </p>  <p>  The BER quality assurance mechanisms were reviewed by external consultants in 2020 and the review recommended the replacement of the registration renewal exam with Continuous Professional Development and a focus on mentoring and learning supports for assessors.

It was also informed by a public consultation, inputs from the relevant Ministers and their Departments, and a call for expert evidence. The 2019 Plan was based on a marginal abatement cost curve and relied largely on known and well understood technologies and measures to reduce emissions. The 2021 Plan built on this analysis in order to deliver the greater ambition committed to in the Programme for Government.  For the 2021 Plan, outputs from the modelling have assisted in developing target emissions reduction ranges for each sector of the economy by 2030 to achieve a 51% reduction, and set Ireland on a pathway to achieving net zero emissions no later than 2050. The Plan also sets out policies, measures and actions needed to deliver these targets. The target emissions reduction ranges will be replaced by specific, legally-binding, sectoral emissions ceilings in the 2022 Climate Action Plan, following their adoption by Government once the economy-wide carbon budgets are approved by the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and over 54,500 premises are available to order and pre-order across 22 counties.  In County Cavan surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Kilnaleck (which includes the premises referred to) and Cootehill and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Cavan, with over 10,400 premises surveyed to date and over 3,700 premises now available to order.  </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Cavan through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 11 February 2022, 486 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cavan 12 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date, including Castlerahan Community Centre which is approximately 3km from the premises referred to. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  In County Cavan 10 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

The NBP network is, therefore, being constructed through the use of existing telecoms infrastructure where possible and the construction of new infrastructure where necessary.National Broadband Ireland is using infrastructure assets including the eir network, ESB assets and the State owned Metropolitan Area Networks.  The NBP network build involves the use of poles, ducts and exchanges and NBI has entered into infrastructure access agreements with the relevant entities. NBI will be utilising over 1.5 million poles and over 15,000 kilometres of duct networks.As part of the rental agreements, eir and enet are fully responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of infrastructure in use by NBI. The full cost of this is included in the annual rental charges to NBI. In the case of eir, the pole and duct infrastructure is fully regulated by ComReg who oversee the appropriate recovery of costs through the rental charges set by eir.</p><p>While the aggregate annual rental to be paid by NBI to eir could be in order of &euro;20m - &euro;30m per annum once the network is fully deployed, the actual annual cost of using the existing infrastructure will not be known until the network is built and a full inventory of all poles and ducts in use by NBI is known. The final costs will also be dependent on reviews by ComReg which generally take place every five years and which can result in rental prices being either increased or reduced.</p><p>The current rural network has been in place for many years and it was anticipated that some remediation work would be needed.  In some areas, the extent of the remediation work is greater than was originally envisaged.  NBI has concluded a service level agreement with openeir with respect to the remediation of poles and ducts as part of the &ldquo;make ready&rdquo; programme. The subsidy for the 25 year period of the NBP is capped at &euro;2.7 billion, made up of the base subsidy of &euro;2.1bn, a further amount of &euro;480m of contingency subsidy that can be claimed in specified circumstances, plus VAT. While the contract provides for circumstances where costs savings revert to the State and the State also stands to share in future profits, National Broadband Ireland carries the full risk for any areas of cost over run, as the State subsidy is capped under the contract. </p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. The CRU is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions, including more generally on the matter raised in this question, to the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister. I understand that the CRU appeared before Committee on Environment and Climate Action as recently as the 15th February to answer questions on these matters.More broadly, and in view of the current pressures faced by households following the exceptional rise in international energy prices I introduced The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022, that now provides for a payment, on a once off basis in 2022, to each domestic electricity account amounting to &euro;200 (including VAT). This payment is part of a suite of policy measures announced by Government designed to give additional support households at this time.

However, it should be noted that the responsibility for the integrity and security of individual ICT networks lies with each individual Department, or Agency.   The Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) based within in the NCSC, has developed and deployed technology on the infrastructure of Government Departments to detect and warn of certain types of threat. The Centre also provides expert advice and analysis on cyber security issues and is involved in coordinating the response to significant incidents. My Department has also recently published the baseline cyber security standard to be applied by all Government  Departments and Agencies. The NCSC worked with colleagues across Government to develop the standard which will support public bodies to identify cyber risks, deploy appropriate mitigation measures, and protect personal and other important data.</p>  <p>  The publication of Baseline Standards is one of the key measures identified in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2019-2024. The Strategy stated that, under Measure 8, that the NCSC (Nationals Cyber Security Centre), would formulate the Baseline Standards in conjunction with the OGCIO (Office of the Government Chief Information Officer). The main goal of the Cyber Security Baseline Standard, that was developed last year, is to improve the resilience and security of information and communications technology infrastructure and systems (ICT) in Public Service Bodies. The Cyber Security Baseline Standards provide a clearly-communicated set of security policies and procedures, to support good cyber security risk management whilst also reflecting business objectives. They are aligned with international standards and include measures and controls in relation to staff training, identity and access management.</p>  <p>  In July 2021 the Government agreed a number of measures to support the continued development of the NCSC over the coming five years. The measures agreed include increasing the overall fulltime staffing complement of the NCSC to at least 70 over the next 5 years. with a first tranche of an additional 20 staff recruited by end 2022 bringing the serving complement to 45. In addition, the General Scheme of a Bill will be prepared for Government approval to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis and provide for related matters including clarity around its mandate. </p></reply>

The RESS supports communities in a variety of ways, including through a separate category for community projects and a mandatory community benefit fund for every project supported in the scheme.  The Climate Action Plan includes a target for at least 500 MW of renewable electricity to be supplied by local community-based projects, meaning approximately 100 community projects will be needed to meet this ambition. In order to ensure such a pipeline of community projects I have allocated &euro;2 million in capital funding in Budget 2022 to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). </p>  <p>  This funding will enable SEAI to deploy a range of capacity-building supports including toolkit guides to assist communities in developing renewable projects. The first four of these, covering grid connection, Solar PV, the planning process and onshore wind, are available on the SEAI website, with more to be developed in the coming months. A trusted intermediary service is also now in place, with an advisor service and financial grant supports to be delivered in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  To ensure genuine community participation for future RESS auctions, only projects that are 100% owned by a Renewable Energy Community (REC) will be eligible for the separate community category, ensuring that all of the benefits from the project stay in the local area. The REC definition in RESS is based on the definition set out in the EU&rsquo;s Clean Energy Package, in particular Article 22 of the Renewable Energy Directive. Accordingly, a REC must be open to all potential local members and its primary purpose should be to provide environmental, economic or social community benefits for the local areas where it operates, rather than financial profits.</p></reply>

The regulations also set out the obligations that will fall to producers, retailers and return point operators under the scheme.The introduction of a Deposit Return Scheme will assist in reducing single use plastics, thus helping Ireland meet EU targets while promoting a wider circular economy. Materials to be included in the scheme will be those for which Ireland faces immediate, challenging EU recycling and separate collection targets.

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 11 February, over 301,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 157,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and over 54,500 premises are available to order and pre-order across 22 counties. In County Cork surveying is underway in the Deployment Area of Clonakilty, surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Templemartin, Tallow, Kanturk and Fermoy, main works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Midleton and Youghal and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Carrigaline.  To date over 35,000 premises in County Cork have been surveyed, with over 10,500 premises under construction and over 4,500 premises now available to order.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 11 February 2022, 486 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork 22 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date, including Lisavaird Community Centre, which is approximately 8.4km from the premises at Rossmore, and Riverstick Community Centre which is approximately 0.1km from the premises at Brookdale, 8.1km from the premises at Ballinhassig and 11.4 km from premises at Bandon. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>In County Cork 15 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

Ireland applies excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to fuels used for motor or heating purposes. </p><p>MOT is comprised of a non-carbon and a carbon component; the carbon component is also referred to as carbon tax. The Deputy will be aware that the 2020 Programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from fuels to &euro;100 by 2030. I followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation in Finance Act 2020 to provide for a 10-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of CO<sub>2 </sub>by 2030. This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. </p><p>The current inflationary trend in fuels is driven by international market factors, primarily by rising demand due to the economic recovery with secondary factors of rising EU ETS allowance prices, weather patterns and gas supply levels in Europe also contributing to rising costs.  </p><p>Of course, the Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices and for this reason we designed a package of measures to alleviate the impact of increased energy prices on households. </p><p>The package of measures includes:</p><p>- an increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households</p><p>- a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance will be paid to 390,000 recipients</p><p>- there will be a temporary reduction in public transport fares of 20% from the end of April to the end of the year. This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Go Ahead, Luas, DART and Local Link services.</p><p>- a reduction of the Drug Payment Scheme from &euro;144 to &euro;80. This will benefit just over 70,000 families</p><p>- the working family payment budget increase will be brought forward from 1 June to 1 April</p><p>- reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children</p><p>The package of measures announced by the Government provides support to households in rural and urban areas alike. The &euro;200 energy credit is available to all domestic electricity account holders.The targeted welfare support measures provide financial support to households regardless of geographical location.  The 20 percent fare reduction is available on all public transport routes including Bus &Eacute;ireann and Local Link.  </p><p>However, I recognise that rural areas have less transport options compared to urban areas.This is an issue which the government is currently addressing.  As set out in the National Development Plan, the Government is committed to strengthening rural economies and communities and enhancing regional accessibility, with a range of investments proposed in new and existing public transport infrastructure.The Plan also commits to significant investment in the land transport network and the upcoming National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland will set out the priorities for investment in the land transport network.  </p><p>The Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, Our Rural Future, also contains over 150 commitments to the improvement of the quality of life in rural Ireland, to be delivered by central Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  These include commitments to providing improved rural transport services, piloting new transport initiatives to enhance the quality of life for people in rural areas, and ensuring that public transport services in rural and regional areas are accessible to those with disabilities or reduced mobility. </p><p>The Policy aims to develop expanded Local Link Services and to further integrate Local Link Services with other existing public transport services through the rollout of the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s Connecting Ireland Plan.  There is also a commitment to develop a grant-aided Community Transport Service Scheme through Local Link, as well as to running a pilot to examine the potential for hail-riding services to improve rural connectivity and to develop a subsidised Local Area Hackney Scheme in designated areas that are too small to support a full-time taxi or hackney service. </p><p>The Policy also commits to investing in high quality walking and cycling infrastructure specifically targeted at towns and villages across the country, investing in the local and regional road network to maintain roads to a proper standard and to increase regional connectivity and to increasing investment in the repair of non-public roads through the Local Improvement Scheme.</p></reply>

This is a valuable relief from CAT and a fundamental objective of this relief is that it is availed of by genuine, and active farmers, and that it relates to agricultural land which is being actively farmed. </p>  <p>  One of the key conditions for agricultural relief is that agricultural property must make up at least 80% of a beneficiary&rsquo;s total property. Prior to the changes made in Finance Act 2017, any land leased for solar panels was not classified as agricultural land and therefore could not be counted towards satisfying this 80% threshold. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the then Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland and the potential role of farmland in achieving this, an amendment was made to allow land leased for solar panels to be classified as qualifying agricultural activity under certain conditions.  </p>  <p>  While introducing this amendment, it was important that sight was not lost of the fundamental principle which underpins agricultural relief policy, namely to support the intergenerational transfer of family farms and to encourage succession planning. Therefore, a key aspect of this relief is to ensure that  it is  targeted at land which is actively farmed. Consequently to facilitate the above policy objectives, the amendment included a condition that in order to be classified as qualifying agricultural activity, the total area under lease for solar should not exceed 50% of the total area of agricultural land.  </p>  <p>  This addressed any potential disincentive to leasing land for solar panels, while also preserving the integrity of this generous CAT relief. There are currently no plans to further increase the current agricultural relief for the leasing of agricultural lands for solar energy production. </p></reply>

Until the Finance Act 2019 Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime, despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced). Section 6 of the Finance Act 2019 legislated for a fundamental overhaul of the regime which brought in discount and surcharge rates based on a car&rsquo;s emissions profile, and is due to commence from 1/1/2023. </p>  <p>  There have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment. </p>  <p>  Acknowledging these environmental concerns however, the reform brought in the 2019 Finance Act reduced the mileage bands from five to four, thus weakening any perverse incentives of increasing mileage to reduce tax liability while still seeking to apply the tax in proportion to the quantum of benefit derived from the car.  The new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges provides a broad structure to incentivise employers to make greener choices when providing employees with company cars; the system will mean that low-emission vehicles and any EVs that are liable for a BIK charge will benefit from a preferential rate ranging from 9 - 22.5%, depending on mileage. Conversely, high emissions vehicles will be subject to higher rates of BIK. This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland currently has a BIK relief for electric vehicles which is due to continue until end 2025. Further details are available on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

The National Remote Work Strategy aims to make remote work a permanent feature of the Irish working experience in a way that maximises the economic, social and environmental benefits. </p>  <p>  As part of the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) reviewed the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The TSG paper outlines the effects of Covid-19 on remote working in Ireland, provides an international comparison of remote working tax rules, sets out options for consideration with regard to enhancing the tax arrangements for both employers and employees in respect of remote work and evaluates those options in accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines. The paper is published on the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  The feasibility of a bespoke tax credit for remote workers was considered as part of the review undertaken by the TSG, noting that stakeholders indicated a preference for a stand-alone remote working credit. However, for a number of reasons, including those outlined in the TSG paper, this option was not pursued. A tax credit for remote working would give rise to issues of deadweight loss and economic inefficiencies, as well as equity issues in the personal tax system. Further, it would be necessary to define qualifying criteria and potentially a minimum eligibility qualifying criteria to avail of the criteria that may necessitate distinctions be drawn between those that work from home on a full time basis and those that work from home on a part time basis. The cost of such a measure was another aspect that was considered. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, as part of my Budget 2022 deliberations, I decided not to introduce a tax credit for remote working. Instead, I introduced an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and internet services in respect of those incurred while working from home can be claimed by taxpayers. This measure enhances and formalises existing arrangements that are currently operated by Revenue on an administrative basis and its legislative aspects were provided for in Finance Act 2021.</p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure will provide some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home.   </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s online system will enable individuals claim tax relief in real time as they pay for these costs throughout the year. People are, generally speaking, well accustomed to supplying receipts to vouch expenditure in order to claim refunds of monies in other areas.  For example, claiming refunds of medical expenses from health insurers are typically done on this basis.  A similar model operates for tax refund claims in respect of remote working expenses and, I am advised that, Revenue has sought to make the submission of such claims as easy as possible for taxpayers.   </p>  <p>  PAYE workers can make a claim for remote working relief in one of two ways:</p>  <p>1.  End of year claim - by completing an Income Tax return at year end</p>  <p>  Where a taxpayer claims remote-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end, he/she can upload supporting documentation via the Revenue Receipts Tracker. He/she can opt to save the information to Revenue storage where it will prefill his or her tax return to assist in the completion and filing of the return. Valid receipts saved to Revenue storage do not need to be retained by the taxpayer for 6 years.</p>  <p>2.  Real-time claim - by using the My Account facility</p>  <p>  Revenue advises that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the MyAccount facility on the Revenue website. Revenue has provided a real-time facility available to claim remote working relief for 2022 when the expense is incurred.   To avail of the credit in real-time the taxpayer is required to upload the receipt details and a readable image of his or her receipt(s) to the Receipts Tracker in MyAccount at the time of making the claim. </p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue has published detailed guidance on this matter on their website, with comprehensive information available in Tax and Duty Manual 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax, which is available at - www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-13.pdf.</p>  <p>  Guidance on how to register for My Account is available at - www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/register-for-an-online-service/register-for-myaccount.aspx.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:</p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  -  be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  -  be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The current medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.</p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  This the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p>  <p>  The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p>  <p>  I cannot comment on any possible changes in advance of proposals arising from the review.  </p></reply>

In respect of the Bandon, Skibbereen and Clonakilty Flood Relief Schemes, which have all reached substantial completion, I refer the Deputy to the responses issued to questions 251, 252 and 253 on the 9<sup>th</sup>September 2021. </p><p><b>Bantry</b></p><p>The Bantry Flood Relief Scheme is being progressed by Cork County Council, in partnership with the OPW.  Following a tender competition, Cork County Council appointed JB Barry and Partners Ltd. in a joint venture with JBA Consulting Ltd. on 3rd February last as engineering and environmental consultants to carry out the design of the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme. The Steering Group, comprising representatives from the Office of Public Works, Cork County Council and the Engineering Consultant is now taken place to progress the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme.  The measures currently proposed for Bantry will protect some 198 properties.  In tandem with progressing this scheme, Cork County Council is preparing the consultants brief, to carry out the repair and re-construction of a culvert on Main Street, which is expected to issue in the first quarter this year.  This culvert has been identified as a significant element contributing to flooding on Main Street, New Street and north and south of Wolfe Tone Square in recent months.  The OPW and Cork County Council shall continue to liaise on the integration of these works with the flood relief scheme for the town.</p><p><b>Midleton</b></p><p>The Midleton flood relief scheme is currently in the final stages of scheme development of a number of flood relief options and the identification of a preferred scheme which is expected to be completed by Quarter 3 of 2022. It is also expected to move to planning stage towards the end of this year.  The next Public Participation Day is to be scheduled for Quarter 2 of 2022.  A Scheme Climate Change Adaptation Plan is being included in the scheme to aid in current and future options. The Midleton Flood Relief Scheme will protect some 246 properties when complete.</p><p><b>Ballyvourney/Ballymakeera</b></p><p>The OPW, in partnership with Cork County Council, are engaging proactively to progress a preferred option for the Ballyvourney/Ballymakeera Flood Relief Scheme and to provide proposals for Public Exhibition to inform a scheme that is technically, environmentally and economically viable to proceed to detailed design stage. Environmental surveys were updated in 2021 by the environmental engineers on the project with a view to completing the Environment Impact Assessment and to ensure that suitable mitigation requirements are implemented and appropriate processes to comply with statutory provisions are followed. The scheme will protect some 90 properties when complete. </p><p><b>Ballinhassig</b></p><p>A pre-feasibility study into the flooding issues in Ballinhassig has been completed by the Office of Public Works and has identified a preferred option for the area. Further assessment of the environmental impacts is currently being reviewed to inform the planning process, after which the project will progress to planning and detailed design. The scheme will protect some 8 properties when complete. </p><p>The proposed schemes for Ballingeary, Inchigeelagh, Inishannon, Castlemartyr, Castletown Bearhaven, Kanturk, Rathcormack, Schull and Youghal are not in the first tranche of projects to be progressed. The OPW and Cork County Council are working closely to ensure that the programme of flood relief projects identified for Cork County is kept under review, and that all projects will be commenced as soon as possible within the timeframe of the current National Development Plan.  The OPW, working closely with its Local Authority Delivery Partners, at all times strives to expedite and progress capital flood relief works with the minimum delay within the resources available to it.</p><p>In relation to schemes being progressed in the Cork City area, the status is as follows:</p><p><b>Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme and Morrison&rsquo;s Island</b></p><p>The Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme (LLFRS) is currently at Planning and Detailed Design stage and it is intended to submit the Scheme for Confirmation to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform later in 2022.  While the project budget of the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme at Public Exhibition stage was &euro;140m, significant enhancements to the proposed scheme design, resulting from engagement and submissions at Public Exhibition stage, will require this figure to be revised before the submission for Confirmation.  Once the Scheme is confirmed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, and following the appointment of Contractors, the Scheme will have an anticipated construction period of 5-6 years.</p><p>The estimated cost for the Lower Lee Scheme includes approximately &euro;12m for the Morrison&rsquo;s Island scheme, which is a Cork City Council-led public realm scheme with flood defence elements part-funded by the OPW.  Although the Morrison&rsquo;s Island project is primarily a public realm project, it will also include the integration of flood defences in the area, and elements of its design are therefore being coordinated with the design of the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme, and co-funded by the Office of Public Works. </p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted approval for the Morrison&rsquo;s Island Public Realm and Flood Defence Project in June 2020.  However, in August 2020, the Save Cork City (SCC) Community Association Ltd. applied for, and was granted, leave to take a Judicial Review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision to approve the project.  The Judicial Review hearing took place in July 2021 and the High Court upheld the Decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant the planning permission for the proposed development, and refused a stay on the undertaking of any works pursuant to the grant of the planning permission for the proposed development.  Accordingly, tender documentation for the procurement of a civil works contractor is being finalised and will issue following the pre-qualification process for the shortlisting of candidates for the tender process, which is currently ongoing. </p><p><b>Blackpool</b></p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform confirmed the Blackpool Flood Relief Scheme, with an estimated cost of &euro;20.5m, in March 2021 and construction was expected to commence in 2022.  </p><p>In June 2021, the community group, Save Our Bride Otters (SOBO), was granted leave to apply for a Judicial Review of the decision of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to approve the Blackpool Flood Relief Scheme. A stay was also granted on works being carried out pursuant to the Decision, pending the resolution of these proceedings.</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure has agreed to consent to an order reverting the evaluation of the Blackpool Flood Relief scheme back to an advanced stage of further public consultation. In agreeing to this, the Department of Public Expenditure has conceded the matter on a single ground related to public consultation procedures on certain information as part of the confirmation process. The confirmation process for this scheme, including any additional public consultation required, is a matter for the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Office of Public Works will continue to engage with Department for Public Expenditure and Reform as appropriate to further progress the scheme.</p><p>The Office of Public Works, along with a multi-disciplinary team, has done extensive work over the last nine years to analyse, assess and model the flood risk in Blackpool, and has considered a wide range of options for managing the significant risk posed to property and people. This work has resulted in the development of the most effective Flood Relief Scheme to provide this community with much-needed protection from extreme flood events, both now and into the future. During the course of the development of the Blackpool (River Bride) Flood Relief Scheme, the OPW also has engaged extensively with the public and other stakeholders. The proposed flood relief scheme is a critically required infrastructural investment in the Blackpool area, which will serve to protect the businesses and people in the area from the ongoing risk of flooding. The Office of Public Works reiterates its commitment to achieving this objective.</p><p><b>Douglas and Togher</b></p><p>The Douglas flood relief scheme (including Togher culvert) is being progressed by Cork County Council and Cork City Council (following boundary extension). In November 2017, planning approval was given by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the Douglas (including Togher culvert) scheme.  The scheme is being delivered in three Phases. Construction of the scheme commenced in 2019, with the first two phases now substantially complete. The construction contract was awarded for the final phase, Phase 3 - Togher Main works, in Summer 2021, with the scheme now at construction. The scheme will protect some 231 properties. </p><p><b>Glashaboy River (Glanmire Sallybrook)</b></p><p>The Glashaboy River Flood Relief Scheme at Glanmire / Sallybrook, Cork is being progressed by Cork City Council. This scheme was confirmed on 18th January 2021 by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The scheme will provide protection to some 103 properties.  Cork City Council as the Contracting Authority for the project will appoint the civil works contractor.  Tenders for the above scheme were invited by Cork City Council on eTenders on 30th September 2021, with the closing date for receipt of tenders of 24th January 2022. The tenders are currently being assessed and it is anticipated that construction of the scheme will commence in Quarter 2, 2022.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-23a.172.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022300069#WRD03800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 104 together.</p>  <p>The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme was introduced in 2012 for borrowers of commercial lending institutions and is targeted at those households in mortgage arrears who have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable by their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), who agree to the voluntary surrender of their home and who have very limited options, if any, to meet their long-term housing needs themselves. In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant. </p>  <p>  Under the MTR scheme, the borrower surrenders their property to their lender and it will be then sold to the MTR provider who is interested in the property. This can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd. If more than one party is interested in buying the property, the lender will provide information to the borrower around the options available to them and the borrower will make the decision on who purchases the property. The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income. </p>  <p>  In the initial years of the scheme, the scheme relied solely on AHBs to purchase from lenders, properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by borrowers. A Review of the MTR scheme for borrowers of commercial private lending institutions was published in February 2017. While there are obvious social and economic benefits to be derived from the MTR scheme, most significantly by facilitating individual households in mortgage arrears to remain in their home, the 2017 Review acknowledged that consideration needed to be given to the capacity of AHBs to intensify their involvement in the MTR scheme given the ambitious targets for the AHB sector around delivering new social housing supply.</p>  <p>  The 2017 Review committed to exploring the potential of private institutional investment in MTR in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale. The capital outlay to purchase these properties could be provided through private finance to avoid competing for upfront exchequer capital resources within the overall funding available for social housing. An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sectors to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) acted as financial advisor during the process, undertaking due diligence on the financial capacity of the proposers to commit to the long-term undertaking of the scheme. The outcome from the EOI process was that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.</p>  <p>  Under this alternatively funded model, Home for Life Ltd. purchases properties from lenders subsequent to their voluntary surrender by borrowers that meet the MTR eligibility criteria and then enters into a long-term 25 year lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for a defined term at an agreed rent, thereby enabling the borrower to remain living in their own home under a tenancy agreement with the local authority. Home for Life Ltd. is also responsible for managing and maintaining the property on behalf of the local authority in accordance with the lease requirements. </p>  <p>  Regardless of who the property owner is under the MTR scheme, AHB or Home for Life Ltd., the local authority is obliged to meet the housing needs of social housing tenants indefinitely and beyond the term of the applicable lease arrangement. </p>  <p>  A key benefit of the MTR scheme is that a unit is being brought into social housing rather than an additional social housing unit having to be sourced from the rental market at a time of increasing acute supply issues in the rental market or removing an additional rental unit from the rental market. The availability of the scheme means that people can avoid losing their homes and the associated family upheaval. As the household are at risk of losing their home, the scheme avoids an additional person or household being placed on the social housing list or additional reliance on other housing support schemes such as the Housing Assistance Payment.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of a private entity, in addition to the existing AHBs who continue to be an integral part of the MTR scheme, gives opportunities to achieve greater scale and meet the long-term housing needs of a greater number of borrowers who have unsustainable mortgage arrears. This is evident through the increased number of completed cases since the private entity has entered into the scheme - up to the end December 2021, they have facilitated 672 families (40% of all MTR cases) to stay in their homes. In 2021, approximately 250% more cases were completed as part of the scheme than in 2019. </p>  <p>  Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme. In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focused on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears. </p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website,  ww.pyriteboard.ie.  Under these conditions, if on 12 December 2013 a person owned, whether or not jointly, more than one dwelling, they may only make an application to the Pyrite Resolution Board for inclusion of one of those dwellings in the Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Housing Agency implement the remediation process and undertake procurement of professional services and the remediation contracts. At the end of 2021, 2292 homes had been remediated at a cost of approximately &euro;150m. </p>  <p>   In relation to the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant (DCB) Scheme, I brought a Memorandum to Government on an enhanced scheme on the 30 November 2021. It included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme which removes the financial barrier to scheme entry by simplifying and streamlining the application process.  It also increases the grants available from 90% to 100% of allowable costs and the maximum grant level from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000, provides for a second grant in certain circumstances, introduces an independent appeals process and strengthens the certificate of remediation available to homeowners.  Government approved the enhanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2Bn.  The terms of the enhanced DCB scheme reflect favourably when compared to the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.</p>  <p>  The grant scheme when originally introduced was available to principal private residence only.  However, I have extended that to now include the individual&rsquo;s principal private residence and RTB registered properties, that is, a house or apartment which an individual owns (or co-owns) and occupies as his or her only or main residence and a rented dwelling with a Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) registered tenancy on November 1st 2021 subject to a maximum of one rental property per household and the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used.  </p>  <p>  The decision to go with a grant scheme, as opposed to the type of scheme provided by the Pyrite Resolution Board, gives homeowners the flexibility to manage their own projects and allow them to deal directly with their appointed contractor. It is also of note that the quantum of homes affected is in the region of 7,500, the majority of which would be a bespoke design. This means the large scale and individualised, home by home plans that form much of the work involved is not currently feasible for the type of scheme provided by the Pyrite Resolution Board via the Housing Agency. Homeowners will also be eligible for the newly revised SEAI retrofit grants.  </p>  <p>  In relation to building standards, the Building Regulations apply to certain works to existing buildings e.g. all works in connection with the material alteration or extension of an existing building, a repair and renewal that is likely to affect the structural integrity of the building or building element being repaired or renewed etc. </p>  <p>  The requirements of the Building Regulations are set out in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M). Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each part of the Building Regulations indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice. Some technical guidance documents provide specific guidance on works to an existing building e.g. Section 2 of TGD L Conservation of Fuel and Energy. No works shall be carried out to a building which would cause a new or greater contravention in the building of any provision of Building Regulations. As a result, in general, the reinstatement of building elements in a remediation project is on a &lsquo;like for like&rsquo; performance basis. </p></reply>

This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, including those set out in Class 18 of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, the regulations will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country with limited restriction zones around airports. </p>  <p>  The draft regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside the draft regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence shortly. A copy of the draft regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before the finalisation of the draft  regulations. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. It is intended that the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming months.</p>  <p>  While these regulations are being advanced, my Department is concurrently examining the scope to draft supplementary regulations to further expand the exemptions by way of reducing the proposed restriction zones around airports. </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of the proposed exempted development regulations in respect of solar panels, and subject to compliance with the conditions associated with the relevant proposed exemption under Class 18 of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations, there will be no need to seek planning permission for a wide range of solar panel development on an agricultural structure, or within the curtilage of an agricultural holding.

Teagasc has undertaken hedgerow mapping on a national scale, and while no comprehensive national survey has been carried out to date, a number of Local Authorities have commissioned hedgerow surveys at county level. The latest was commissioned by Monaghan County Council in 2021. This survey was co-funded by The Heritage Council.

The appropriate loan-to-value ratio is a matter for that Minister.</p>  <p>  My Department has a number of policies in place to support homeownership. </p>  <p>  The Local Authority Home Loan is a Government backed mortgage for those on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. </p>  <p>  To support prudential lending and consistency of treatment for borrowers, a maximum Loan-to-Value ratio of 90% as per the Central Banks lending guidelines applies to this loan. There is no minimum loan-to-value ratio, however it is only available to applicants who cannot obtain sufficient offers of finance on the market.</p>  <p>  For single persons, the income ceiling is EUR65,000 for persons seeking to purchase in home in Dublin, Louth, Wicklow, Laois, Wicklow, Meath, Cork and Galway, and EUR50,000 in the rest of the country. The income limit for joint applicants is EUR75,000. House price limits also apply, the maximum house price is EUR320,000 in Dublin, Louth, Wicklow, Laois, Wicklow, Meath, Cork and Galway, and EUR250,000 in the rest of the country. </p>  <p>  To avail of the loan applicants must have a deposit equivalent to 10% of the market value of the property. The applicant(s) must provide bank or similar statements (post office, credit union, etc.) for a 12-month period immediately prior to making an application clearly showing a credible and consistent track record of savings. The cash savings should be no less than 3% of the market value of the property. Gifts are permissible up to 7% of the market value of the property where their source is verified.</p>  <p>  Further information, including a Home Loan Calculator and the Application Form is available on the website localauthorityhomeloan.ie/.</p>  <p>  In relation to measures that support more affordable housing more generally, the Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever standalone affordable housing legislation, established a basis for four new affordable housing measures. These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will support purchasers of Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. Regulations to set out the detailed criteria are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks. The first homes delivered through the scheme will be located in Cork City in the coming weeks. Cork City Council indicated the prices to be &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling.</p>  <p>  The First Home affordable purchase shared equity scheme, established under Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, will act in a similar way to the Local Authority-led scheme, but will support purchases of newly constructed homes on the private market. This scheme will be available in every county and will incorporate regional price caps based on median house price sales. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications from mid year. </p></reply>

Biodiversity officers advise local authorities in relation to their obligations with regard to national and local biodiversity policies, programmes and priorities.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to supporting local authorities in the important role they play in the implementation of actions contained in the National Biodiversity Action Plan.

This measure was aimed at facilitating the productive re-use of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply.</p><p>The Government's recently published <i>Housing Plan for Ireland - Housing for All </i>commits to reviewing and extending the 2018 regulations to the end of 2025. The recently signed Planning and Development Act (Exempted Development) Regulations 2022 fulfill that commitment.</p><p>The conditions and limitations that applied to the 2018 exempted development provisions will continue to apply under the new regulations which includes provision that works shall not be permitted in a number of limited areas, such as areas of special planning control and areas to which special amenity area orders relate. Under section 82 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act), works to the exterior of a structure located in an architectural conservation area shall be exempted development only if those works would not materially affect the character of the area. Where a person wishes to seek advice in relation to whether proposed works might materially affect the character of an architectural conservation area, they should contact the local Heritage Officer or the local planning office.</p><p>Furthermore works to protected structures shall not be allowed under the exemptions save where the relevant planning authority has issued a declaration under section 57 of the Act to the effect that the proposed works would not materially affect the character of the structure or any element of the structure which contributes to its special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest.</p><p>My Department is in the process of issuing a Circular Letter to planning authorities advising them of the newly extended exempted development regulations. The Circular will include the specific advice that care should be taken to ensure compliance with relevant legislative requirements in relation to the assessment of potential impacts on bats, their roosts and nesting birds arising from any proposed works in relevant structures.</p></reply>

In line with this Act, a water services authority is responsible for water services infrastructure, including manholes, extending from a waterworks or waste water works to the curtilage of a private property.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has been responsible for the planning and delivery of public water and waste water services. Each local authoriity, however, continues to be responsible for storm water infrastructure, including manholes, within its own functional area.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that, in line with sections 43 and 54 of the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for water or waste water pipes, including manholes, which are located within the boundary of a property rests with the owner of the property. In this way, local authorities who typically own a range of properties including offices, housing and other buildings relevant to their functional responsibilities, may continue to be responsible for pipework, including manholes, located within the curtilage of their own properties.  </p>  <p>  Further assistance can be obtained from Irish Water who would be best placed to advise whether particular manholes in the public realm belong to the public water system in their ownership. It may also be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 0818 578 578.</p></reply>

The scheme will support first-time buyers on moderate incomes in purchasing new-build homes by means of an equity stake model, similar to that used in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase scheme. <i>First Home</i>will be subject to regional price ceilings reflective of the median prices paid by first-time buyers for new-build homes, so it is an intervention to assist buyers in the lower area of the home price distribution. The scheme will be targeted at those who have insufficient funds to purchase one of these homes using the mortgage and deposit available to them, and will use equity support to &lsquo;bridge the gap&rsquo;. </p><p>Budget 2022 allocated &euro;44 million to my Department for <i>First Home</i>. The banking sector has confirmed it is committed to working with the State to develop and deliver this scheme, and has agreed in principle to match this State funding in order to increase the pool of funding available to potential new homeowners. Subject to the necessary approvals by all parties, it is anticipated that the <i>First Home</i>scheme will operate for the period 2022 to 2025, utilising overall funding of c. &euro;400m to provide support to c. 8,000 households to purchase new homes.  </p><p>The scheme will be operated via the First Home Scheme Ireland Designated Activity Company, which has recently been incorporated. Significant work is continuing on the detailed design and parameters of the scheme, and full details including scheme conditionality will be confirmed upon completion of this work.

I have continued to engage regularly with the Secretary of State and with the leaders of the parties in Northern Ireland on this most sensitive issue, and I have continued to caution the British Government strongly against unilateral action in this space.  The Taoiseach has also communicated this message to Prime Minister Johnson. </p>  <p>  The Government remains ready to engage and work with the British Government and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive in partnership on this very important issue in the period immediately ahead, with a view to reaffirming a collective approach that is consistent with the Stormont House Agreement framework, and for all victims, survivors and society as a whole.</p></reply>

I have raised the matter of our undocumented a number of times, including in high level meetings during my most recent visit to Washington, D.C. We continue to seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relationship with the US Administration and members of Congress on a bipartisan basis, including in support of US immigration reform, through our Embassy in Washington D.C., which acts as the Irish Government's representative in the US.  </p>  <p>  The Government also remains committed to providing support and annual funding to the US Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers through our Emigrant Support Programme. These facilities, in turn, provide support to Irish citizens, including the undocumented Irish in the US. In 2020, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. In 2021, over &euro;4.2 million was paid to diaspora organisations in the US for emigrant support and Covid-19 related projects.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of my Department's Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8 kms at post-primary from and are attending their nearest school/education centre as determined by my Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. An eligible child for whom no transport service is available may, following an application and payment for transport within prescribed time limits, receive a Remote Area Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements. This grant is also payable for eligible children who may have to travel 3.2 kms or more to or from a designated pick up/set down point. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  In general, children with special educational needs are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest school that is resourced to meet their special educational needs. Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers.  A Special Transport Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be provided to families of eligible children in certain situations such as where Bus &Eacute;ireann is not in a position to provide a transport service or where a child's age, behavioural difficulties or medical needs are such as to make the provision of a transport service impracticable;</p>  <p>  There are no plans currently to increase the rate of payment for the Remote Area Grant or Special Transport Grant. </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may be aware that my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme,  its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately.</p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review which is now underway. The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme.</p></reply>

The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the Board of Management on behalf of the school Patron and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters with the exception of new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand which are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  </p>  <p>  My Department will shortly be engaging further with patron bodies in advance of identifying specific September 2022 capacity pressure point priorities which will necessitate specific action.</p></reply>

Through this intensive intervention, we have seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year. </p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>In terms of Laois, I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in primary and post-primary schools.  Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years to meet the demand for places.</p><p>We are always grateful to those schools that have responded, and continue to respond positively to meet the educational needs of children in their communities.</p><p>Currently, a network of 35 primary special classes, including 4 Early Intervention classes, and 8 post primary special classes provide specialist placements for students with autism in Laois.  6 of these classes were newly established for the current school year. </p><p>The NCSE is continuing to engage with primary and post-primary schools throughout County Laois regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond. There are specific plans in place to open additional special classes and every support will be made available to progress their opening in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on September next. </p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class. </p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the type and location of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at </p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is aware of increasing local pressures and demand for primary and post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas including school planning areas in Santry and Whitehall, Dublin 9.  </p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.  </p><p>My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in Santry and Whitehall, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train, including the provision of modular accommodation where necessary.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>A number of capital projects have been recently completed or are currently planned or underway in the Dublin 9 area, including expansions at St. Aidan&rsquo;s CBS, St. Kevin's College and Clonturk College. The additional capacity being provided by all of these projects is being considered in the context of the projected future requirements in the area. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own. </p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is a benefit under the Occupational Injuries Scheme.  It can be paid to a recipient who suffers a loss of physical or mental faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work.  The contribution requirements for the scheme are minimal when compared to other Departmental benefit schemes.  </p>  <p>  People in receipt of Disablement Benefit (without another payment) can work full or part time and continue to receive the Benefit Payment &ndash; in other words they are not prevented from generating additional income.  </p>  <p>  In the alternative, it can be and is paid at the same time as most social welfare payments including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, State Pension and One-Parent Family Payment.  It is not considered as means for most social welfare means-assessed schemes except for Fuel Allowance, Supplementary Welfare Allowance or Working Family Payment. </p>  <p>  Incapacity Supplement is an increase payable in addition to Disablement Benefit where a person is considered to be permanently incapable of work as a result of an occupational accident or disease and does not qualify for another Social Welfare benefit such as Illness Benefit.  This Incapacity Supplement is a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.   </p>  <p>  Therefore, while Disablement Benefit on its own is a disqualifying payment for Fuel Allowance because a person may continue to or take up work, or may receive another social welfare payment in parallel, qualification for Incapacity Supplement in addition to Disablement Benefit qualifies that recipient for Fuel Allowance (subject to satisfying all other qualifying criteria).</p>  <p>  I have asked officials in my Department to review the treatment of disablement benefit under the fuel allowance scheme and this review is currently ongoing.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department also provides Exceptional Needs Payments which may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This was reflected in the National Economic Recovery Plan.  Budget 2022 included an announcement of &euro;25 million to pilot a new Basic Income Guarantee scheme for artists. </p>  <p>  My colleague the Minister for Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has lead responsibility for this initiative and the matter is being progressed by Minister Martin and her Department.</p>  <p>  It is not possible for my Department to provide costings, pending development of detailed proposals. Any issues regarding the interaction between the new pilot payment and existing payments from my Department will fall to be addressed in due course as work on the proposed pilot is progressed.</p>  <p>  The cost of disability is significantly broader than income supports and it is clear that it will not be addressed through income support alone.  With regard to the research to which the Deputy refers, its findings have implications for many areas of public policy including the delivery of care services, health, housing, education, transport and income supports so this is why a whole-of-Government perspective is needed.  With regards to implementing an all-Department response, the Government has referred the report on the Cost of Disability to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, Anne Rabbitte, T.D.  This Group has oversight of monitoring the key frameworks for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities in Ireland and it is in this regard that the Government saw it fitting that this group would be the appropriate monitoring vehicle.  It will consider and monitor actions required by the various Government Departments on foot of this report on a bi-annual basis.  All Departments have been asked to consider actions that are currently being implementing and any proposed new actions that they will be undertaking in the context of the findings of the Report.</p></reply>

These payments are considered secondary in nature.</p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase (LAI) is one of those secondary payments.  It is not a scheme or a stand-alone payment in itself, but rather it is a supplement to a primary social protection payment of &euro;22 per week made to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.

These payments are considered secondary in nature.</p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase (LAI) is one of those secondary payments.  It is not a scheme or a stand-alone payment in itself, but rather it is a supplement to a primary social protection payment of &euro;22 per week made to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  For those aged 66 or over, these payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory), Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension, Widow's/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.  </p>  <p>  There are no circumstances where the Living Alone Increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment from my Department.

BOBF concluded at the end of 2020 and I published the final Annual Report (2020) in January 2022. At that time I stated a need to look forward in our collective efforts to further improve outcomes for children and young people in Ireland, taking the learnings from the BOBF process on board. Work has begun in my Department on the development of the successor Framework and I look forward to working with all stakeholders in its development and implementation.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is reviewing the Child Care Act 1991, following extensive consultation with stakeholders. The 1991 Act is a wide-ranging piece of legislation, which seeks to promote the welfare of children who may not receive adequate care and protection. The proposals include changes across a wide range of areas, from relatively minor or procedural issues, to more significant reform proposals.  Some of the more significant areas of focus are as follows:</p><p>- It is proposed to introduce a guiding principles section to the Act, with the best interests of the child to be the paramount principle. </p><p>- Proposals to foster improved interagency cooperation include introducing a duty to cooperate and legislating for both local and national coordination bodies.</p><p>- The voice of the child is to be strengthened both in court proceedings and in decisions taken outside the court setting.</p><p>- The proposals also include amendments to existing rules for Supervision Orders, Interim Care Orders, Care Orders, Emergency Care Orders and Voluntary Care Agreements. </p><p>My Department is also developing new Guardian ad litem legislation, which aims to extend the GAL system to benefit the greatest number of children and young people, and to ensure that the best interests of children and young people are paramount in childcare proceedings. In addition, work is continuing on the reform of the family justice system by the Department of Justice, and my Department continues to be represented on the Family Justice Oversight Group in this respect.</p><p>Finally, my priority is to ensure that all children in State care receive a high quality service and are supported to reach their full potential, as children, and into adulthood.  My officials liaise on an ongoing basis with Tusla officials, to identity and address issues relating to children in care as they arise, and across all the relevant settings. I also note that in the 2022 Performance Statement, I have requested that Tusla work to increase Tusla provided residential services and move towards a reduction in reliance on private provision.</p></reply>

The programmes with the longest waiting lists (electrical, plumbing and carpentry) have seen significant reform measures. &euro;30m of additional funding was allocated in 2021 to tackle the backlog. This included &euro;20m in investment in workshops and &euro;10m in additional teaching and support staff.</p>  <p>   In addition to this investment, a number of agreed reform measures are being implemented to help clear the lists. These include changed delivery structures for Phase 2 off-the-job training which is facilitating a third intake of apprentices per annum and an opt-in rapid employer assessment which is being piloted at Phase 7 (on-the-job) for apprentices who have completed Phase 6 and spent more than four years in their apprenticeship.</p>  <p>  At the end of January 9,570 craft apprentices were waiting for access to phase 2, 4 or 6 off-the-job training. This is down from nearly 12,000 apprentices who were waiting last August. To ensure that the remainder of the Covid backlog is cleared and the system has the capacity to meet the training needs of rapidly increasing numbers of apprentices, expansion of the apprenticeship system is continuing in 2022. </p>  <p>  In particular, further major investment in workshops and staff is planned for this year. Regarding the apprentice that the Deputy referred to in his question, my Departments officials have been in touch with SOLAS and have confirmed that he is due to be called to his phase 6 off-the-job training in Term 1 September 2022 at Carlow IT.</p></reply>

It facilitates the sharing of information between the Department of Health and its agencies. It is a long-standing structure which has been utilised over many years to provide a forum to steer strategic approaches to public health emergencies in Ireland and mobilise the necessary health service responses. National Public Health Emergency Teams have been established in recent years in response to public health threats, including H1N1 (swine flu) and CPE (Carbapenemase Producing Enterobacterales), for example. This public health approach is in line with the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>  <p>  Since its first meeting in January 2020, the NPHET for COVID-19 has overseen and provided direction, guidance, support and expert advice across the health service and the wider public service for the overall national response to COVID-19, including national and regional and other outbreak control arrangements. In particular, the NPHET has played a critical role in closely and continuously monitoring the evolving impact of COVID-19 on Ireland&rsquo;s population, as well as the health service&rsquo;s capacity, performance, and ability to respond. </p>  <p>  Following its meeting on 20th January 2022, the NPHET advised that the prevailing profile of COVID-19 in Ireland and the available evidence and experience of Omicron internationally allowed for a fundamental change in the management of COVID-19. It advised that this should entail a transition, in broad terms, from a focus on regulation and population wide restrictions to a focus on public health advice, personal judgement and personal protective behaviours.</p>  <p>On 17th February, the NPHET recommended the removal of remaining public health measures from 28th February, as planned, on the basis that there is no longer a continuing public health rationale for retaining them. </p>  <p>  In providing its advice, the NPHET has emphasised we cannot fully rule out the reintroduction of measures in the future and we must continue to ensure our response is agile and flexible, with an ability to respond rapidly and appropriately to any emerging threat. There will be an ongoing requirement to be able to scale up appropriate responses quickly should they be required.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the need for continued vigilance, the NPHET has advised that we are now entering a transition phase of the pandemic response. This transition will entail a shift from the emergency type processes and measures of the last two years while also necessitating the maintenance of high levels of readiness for COVID-19 outbreaks and the emergence of new variants of concern, with significant strengthening of existing disease surveillance systems. </p>  <p>  As we move out of the emergency phase of the pandemic and given the significant mainstreaming of the COVID-19 response, the continuing impact of the vaccination programme, and the programme of work already completed by the NPHET, it is now deemed timely to conclude the work of the NPHET. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Chief Medical Officer will continue to closely monitor the epidemiological profile of the disease and the Minister for Health has been provided with a specific proposal on the appropriate structure and processes for this.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-23a.506.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022300075#WRK02287"><p>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 217 and 259 together. The Department currently has no plans to introduce an independent complaints mechanism for mental health services nor has a review been carried out to ascertain the cost of establishing such a mechanism.</p>  <p>In line with the Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centre) Regulations 2006, each inpatient mental health service, as with general health services, must have a complaints procedure in place, such as the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;Your Service, Your Say&rsquo; service. 'Your Service, Your Say' is available to anyone accessing HSE mental health services, be that on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Following the investigation of the complaint by the HSE, an individual may request an internal review to be carried out by the HSE if they are not happy with the outcome. Furthermore, in cases where the complainant is not satisfied with the response to their complaint, they can request an external review from the Office of the Ombudsman, or in the case of child and adolescent services, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. This option is available to anyone who accesses our public health services, be it mental health services or otherwise.</p>  <p>The General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act, published in July 2021, provides for every person accessing treatment in an inpatient mental health facility to be given information about their care and treatment, including an explicit requirement to provide information on the service&rsquo;s complaints procedure. Furthermore, the powers of the Inspector of Mental Health Services are being expanded to include 24-hour community residential facilities and community mental health services. As under the existing Act, the Inspector will continue to meet with any person accessing mental health services who has requested such a meeting.</p>  <p>The General Scheme also includes a statutory right to engage an advocate under numerous heads, including a definition of advocate under Section 2, information on advocacy to be provided to people in approved inpatient facilities under Section 16, 79 and 91, access to an advocate during a review board under Section 16B, during inquiries carried out by the Inspector under Section 55, or when making decisions about treatment under Sections 56 and 104. </p>  <p>There are a number of advocacy supports for people accessing mental health services offered by the public and voluntary sectors. The HSE currently provides some advocacy supports such as a Peer Advocacy Service in mental health. This service is concentrated on inpatient services and is delivered by an external agency on behalf of the HSE. In addition to adult advocacy services, HSE National Mental Health Services has a pilot scheme in place in two inpatient units to provide an advocacy service through an external provider for young people and their families using Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).</p>  <p>The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS) provides a free, confidential service to people with mental health difficulties, particularly people with complex needs. NAS is funded and supported by the Citizens Information Board, which has a mandate under the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Comhairle Act 2000 to provide advocacy for persons with disabilities. Citizens Information Centres can be found nationwide and provide free, impartial advice and advocacy, or the Citizens Information Phone Service can be reached by phone.  </p>  <p>Sage Advocacy also provides some advocacy support to people with mental health difficulties, particularly older people, in their role in supporting and enabling vulnerable adults and older people to make their voices heard in their healthcare decisions. The Irish Advocacy Network provides peer advocacy supports to people with mental health difficulties which can be accessed on a self-referral basis.</p></reply>

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7. My officials and the HSE are already engaged in preparatory work, and I expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the IMO, representing GPs, later this quarter, after which engagement can commence with the IMO. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.</p>  <p>  Underscoring the government&rsquo;s commitment to Women&rsquo;s Health has been the establishment of a Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce in September 2019 to improve both health outcomes and experiences of healthcare for women and girls. The members of the Taskforce meet regularly, with its fifteenth meeting held in November 2021.</p>  <p>  An important part of the Taskforce&rsquo;s work is to listen to the voices of women and engage with stakeholders both at an individual and organisation level at home and abroad who can share evidence expertise and experiences and ideas to help us achieve this goal. The Taskforce has listened to, engaged, and worked with more than 2,000 women and hundreds of stakeholders and organisations representing women and girls across the country.</p>  <p>  We have made a specific commitment to supporting the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland.</p>  <p>  This Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan for 2022-2023 is currently being finalised and is expected to be brought before Government in the coming weeks.  This plan has been informed by the available evidence and engagement with women across the country, key stakeholders, clinicians, and advocates for women&rsquo;s health through the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan sets forward a wide range of positive initiatives to support women&rsquo;s health and provides a framework for further prioritisation as issues and needs arise.</p>  <p>  This plan captures the women&rsquo;s health activity already committed to and underway and sets out our significant ambition to build further on this in the near term over eighteen months. </p></reply>

Membership of the Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group is comprised of national and international experts with experience across a range of key domains, including public health, health protection, epidemiology, senior public health service leadership, change management, and risk and evidence communication. </p>  <p>  The Expert Group will initially focus on identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland with a view towards strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness specifically. The Expert Group will also identify lessons from international best practice regarding reform and strengthening of other core public health functions, including the promotion of health and wellbeing, population health research and health intelligence and health service improvement.</p>  <p>  To inform the Expert Advisory Group&rsquo;s work, a wide consultation process will commence shortly. Further information on the Expert Group and details of its membership can be found online: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/8beb5-ministers-for-health-establish-the-public-health-reform-expert-advisory-group/ </p></reply>

It is for this reason that supports to ameliorate the costs of illness should be available to all rather than focused on those with particular conditions. This is the principle behind the transition to universal healthcare envisaged by Sl&aacute;intecare, where people access the right services based on need and not ability to pay. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 1970 (as amended), all persons, irrespective of illness or condition, accessing public in-patient (including day case) services in a public hospital are liable for the statutory in-patient daily charge, which is capped at a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of 12 consecutive months. There are however exemptions from these charges for identified groups of people, including but not limited to people with full eligibility, that is medical card holders. </p>  <p>  Medical cards are awarded without a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years. Individuals with a terminal illness who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having a prognosis of 24 months or less to live are also now eligible for a medical card without a means assessment. </p>  <p>  As is the case for all patients, cancer patients can apply for a range of supports, including medical cards, and they are assessed under the criteria applying to all applicants. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. Indeed, the Irish Cancer Society has found that over 80% of those diagnosed with cancer who apply for a medical card are successful. In certain circumstances, the HSE may grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold, where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. </p>  <p>  All patients require a responsive and compassionate health system to meet their medical needs. This is why this Government is continuing to work towards delivering an affordable, accessible and quality health service for all in line with the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></reply>

The private outpatient clinic space at the new children&rsquo;s hospital represents circa 0.25% of the clinical space within the new children&rsquo;s hospital. All clinical outpatient spaces, whether designated as public or private, are to the same specification. </p>  <p>  It is important to say that the capacity being planned for the new children&rsquo;s hospital is national capacity based upon the assessment of healthcare needs and future demographic developments. Accordingly, these clinic rooms will be required to meet the estimated demand for paediatric outpatient and inpatient services, whether publicly or privately provided. </p></reply>

The Points System is intended to promote compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and seeks to deliver on the CFP objective of ensuring proportionate, effective and dissuasive penalties for serious infringements.</p><p>Serious infringements include  the following:- </p><p>- not fulfilling obligations to record and report catch or catch related data </p><p>- concealing, tampering or disposal of evidence relating to an investigation </p><p>- fishing without a valid licence, authorization or permit. </p><p>The points systems were due to be in place by 1 January 2012 and the delay in implementing them prompted the EU Commission to issue EU infringement proceedings against Ireland. A negative judgement from the European Court of Justice in any such proceedings could cost the State significantly in lump sum and ongoing fines.</p><p>Furthermore, serious financial implications arise from the non-implementation of the points system because, as a condition of the EU contribution to  Ireland&rsquo;s  European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme, certain conditions must be fulfilled, including implementation of a points system for both licence holders and masters.  </p><p>To meet the legal requirements on the State, the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2020 - SI No 318/2020 were signed into force in August 2020. SI No 318 adopts the requirements of Article 92 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 and Title VII of  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011.</p><p>In accordance with the EU Regulations, this instrument establishes a point system, which will apply to the licence holder of a sea fishing boat when a serious infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy is detected within the exclusive fishery limits of the State or for an Irish vessel wherever it may be.</p><p>The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is determined as the competent authority for the establishment of the system and the assignment of points. The Licensing Authority is the competent authority for the recording of points assigned to the licence of an Irish registered fishing vessel and the transfer of those points.</p><p>SI No 318/2020 provides for the establishment of a Determination Panel comprised of 3 independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General to determine if on the balance of probabilities a serious infringement occurred. The instrument also establishes an independent appeals officer to review the decision of the Determination Panel at the request of the licence holder.</p><p>My firm view is that SI 318/2020 is necessary to protect law-abiding operators, who make up the vast majority of those in the industry, and to preserve this precious and valuable resource for all Irish fishermen and for future generations. This system in conjunction with the proposed points system for masters currently before the Oireachtas will play a vital role in delivering on the Common Fisheries Policy objective of ensuring proportionate, effective, and dissuasive sanctions for serious infringements and contributing to a level playing field in fisheries control across Member States. </p></reply>

I have consulted with the farm business as to the loss categories that should be included in the Bill.</p><p>The follow on Regulations being prepared at the moment will specify and set out the framework for the income and non-income compensation and provide the basis of valuation.  They will also provide detail on compensation for costs involved in disposing of breeding mink, demolition and clean-up costs, payments to redundant workers, and professional fees for professionals used in the process.  </p><p>Regarding environmental surveys, it is envisaged that the costs for carrying out such will be covered in the compensation package. It is also foreseen that the costs around demolition and clean-up of the sites/remediation of the sites concerned are to be covered.  These provisions are to be part of the Regulations being prepared. I have recently shared a copy of the current draft regulations with the fur farming businesses and their representatives.</p><p>I will release the Grant Thornton Report to the Fur Farming businesses and their representatives shortly. This report assisted in developing the approach to valuation and the various risk categories which were included in the draft Bill last autumn.</p><p>Regarding indicative compensation amounts, all the information the farm businesses need to calculate their potential compensation entitlement is within their possession i.e. their asset values and profit income as filed in their company accounts.  They also possess details with regard to building areas and the design aspects of those buildings. In addition statutory financial caps have been provided in the draft regulations provided. It is important to recall that whilst the legislative process will outline the loss categories for which the farm businesses will be compensated and where relevant the caps that will apply to various categories, that the actual compensation amounts that will arise will be determined by an independent assessor, in response to individual applications with supporting documentation made by the businesses. </p><p>I am advised that the Department of Social Protection have committed to put together a plan or programme for the affected employees in advance of the prohibition.<b></b></p></reply>

Following the &euro;100,000 commitment for this review in Budget 2021, in March 2021, I initiated a public consultation to identify the terms of reference for the review. I also invited stakeholders to make recommendations in relation to prospective market opportunities for wool products on domestic and international markets.</p><p>The agreed terms of reference are: </p><p>- identification of market opportunities domestically and internationally for wool based products;</p><p>- carrying out economic feasibility and cost benefit analysis on proposed market opportunities;</p><p>- determining mechanisms that could be used to support industry initiatives;</p><p>- identification of potential research projects applicable to supporting the identified market opportunities. </p><p>In July 2021, through a competitive public procurement process, a Request for Tenders seeking service providers to carry out this review was published.  In November 2021 I appointed &lsquo;The Agile Executive&rsquo; a consortium of experts from Munster Technological University and Donegal Yarns, to conduct the review.</p><p>The Agile Executive has been contracted to conduct the review in accordance with the Terms of Reference and has also been asked to review the submissions received during the public consultation process. I have been advised that this study is progressing well, and the report is due for publication in March 2022. </p><p>I am confident that the recommendations outlined in the report will assist in the formulation of a strong policy framework for the Irish wool industry, and will hopefully identify new opportunities to create value-add products from Irish wool that are environmentally and economically sustainable and further contribute to the Irish Circular Bioeconomy. </p></reply>
