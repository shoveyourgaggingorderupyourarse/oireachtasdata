    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-26a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012600082#WRB00900"><p>The State's employment permit system is designed to supplement Ireland's skills and labour supply over the short to medium term by allowing enterprises to recruit nationals from outside the EEA, where such skills or expertise cannot be sourced from within the EEA at that time.</p><p>The fees for a General Employment Permit are &euro;500 for a duration of six months or less, and &euro;1,000 for a duration of up to 24 months. The fee levels conform to the cost recovery principle, which provides that the full cost of activities and services are recovered in the medium term.</p><p>Since the outset the Covid-19 pandemic my Department has implemented a contingency plan to ensure that the Employment Permit system will continue to operate in all scenarios.  Under the Covid-19 Employment Permits Contingency Arrangements, published by my Department on 30th March 2020, a 100% refund of the application fee may be granted in cases where an application is withdrawn in advance of a decision being taken on it.  However, the current employment permits legislation does not provide for a refund to be granted after an employment permit has issued, or to offset the fee paid for an issued Employment Permit against a different/new application. The employment permits legislation prescribes that where an application for an employment permit is refused or withdrawn, a portion of 90% of the fee paid is returned to the applicant.</p><p>With regard to the additional information provided by the Deputy the individual in question was issued an employment permit on 30 January 2020.  A refund was requested in September 2020 as it was claimed the individual was unable to travel due to Covid.  The Employment Permits Section informed the applicant on 16 November 2020 that a refund was not possible in this instance.  </p><p>Furthermore, the employment permits system is run on the principle of cost recovery and while not uniquely, the Employment Permits Acts do not provide that the system reflect the cost of administering the service and enforcing the regime, there is an expectation that there is a nexus between fee income and the expenditure of administrating the service, including enforcement and provision of information, in the medium term.</p><p>Further information in relation to the contingency arrangements introduced by Employment Permits Section in response to the pandemic can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website via the following link: <i>enterprise.gov.ie/en/Publications/Publication-files/COVID-19-Employment-Permits-System-Contingency-Arrangements.pdf</i>.</p></reply>

My Department undertook a full public consultation, reviewed international best practice, and formed an interdepartmental group &ndash; to ensure that all views and issues were properly considered in the development of the scheme.  </p><p>The draft Heads of Bill have been published and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>In the first instance, the legislation will provide for a replacement rate of 70% of gross salary for a duration of 3 working days in a calendar year.  Coupled with the 70% rate of pay, the application of a daily earnings cut-off point of &euro;110 will ensure that employers do not face excessive costs and that jobs are not jeopardised.</p><p>Pre-legislative scrutiny has been completed and I hope to receive the Joint Oireachtas Committee's report in the coming weeks. Once this report has been received I will review their findings and then I will be in a position to seek Government approval to present the Bill to the Houses.</p></reply>

It is important for road safety that all traffic, including international traffic, understand the regulatory signage and road markings as displayed, to adequately warn and inform the driver of potential hazards ahead.  Regulatory signs are prescribed by the Minister for Transport.  The principal regulations are the Road Traffic (Signs) regulations 1997 and the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997.  The regulations specify the types of signs which must be used by Road Authorities when providing road traffic regulatory signs and there must be strict compliance with the form and content of these signs.  </p>  <p>   In relation to regulatory road markings written in the Irish language in Gaeltacht areas, it is accepted that the word STOP exists in both English and Irish languages and therefore is not necessary to alternate.  Regarding YIELD, the traffic signs manual does provide for the Irish variant, G&eacute;ill Sl&iacute;, to be used as appropriate, in place of the word YIELD on the traffic sign.  The YIELD symbol is to be used on road markings. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; and this is further reinforced through the implementation strategy set out in Climate Action Plan being published this week. Ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. </p>  <p>  In support of this, preparations are under way to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV), as recommended in the EVPP Report; this will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles. OLEV will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure. This Office will also play an important role in coordinating communications campaigns to encourage EV uptake. </p>  <p>  A generous suite of incentives is available to support individuals who wish to purchase an electric vehicle. In addition to this, officials in my Department are actively examining technological innovations which will in time provide more affordable options to the consumer wishing to purchase an EV. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the SEAI to develop a commercial fleet trial for companies to trial an electric vehicle. It is anticipated that this program will launch in Q1 2022. </p>  <p>  A crucial step in the electrification of Ireland&rsquo;s national fleet is encouraging the commercial and public sectors to adopt electric vehicles into their fleets.  This pilot scheme will afford businesses an opportunity to trial an electric vehicle in real world conditions and showcase the suitability of electric vehicles in the commercial sectors.  Businesses will be exposed to the real-life performance, savings and benefits of electric vehicles without the initial capital outlay.  </p>  <p>  Most vehicles in the commercial sector operate on a 3/4 year service period.  Once this service has been completed, the vehicles tend to move into the second-hand market in Ireland and provide a viable, affordable option for consumers who are unable to purchase new electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  Overall,  the expedition of electric vehicles take up is a key priority for my Department. To this end, electric vehicle policy and expenditure is kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles a realistic option for individuals purchasing a vehicle. </p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport services.</p>  <p>  Public health advice tells us that face coverings are an important safety measure, especially in interior spaces; subsequently, regulations for the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport were introduced back in July 2020. Failure to comply with these regulations is an offence and there are penalties (on summary conviction) for non-compliance. However, as people understand the importance of protecting their fellow passengers and the staff of the public transport operators, it is not intended that enforcement or penalties will be needed often, but they are available if necessary. </p>  <p>  The NTA is engaging regularly with public transport operators regarding implementation of the Regulations, and monitoring compliance levels across the network. The Authority is also responsible for the collection and publication of statistics relating to public transport. I have, therefore, forwarded the Deputy's questions to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days. </p></reply>

The intention is that the payment will not be subject to income tax, USC or PRSI. There are no plans to extend the proposed tax disregard along the lines mentioned by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  With regard to the tax-free voucher scheme the Deputy raises, I believe he is referring to  the Small Benefit Exemption. This measure allows an employer to provide limited benefits or rewards to their workers without the payment of income tax. A qualifying incentive for the purposes of the scheme may be either a voucher or other tangible asset which does not exceed &euro;500 in value. These could take the form of hampers, meals out, gym/sports memberships, restaurant vouchers or other non-cash benefits. Where the qualifying incentive provided is a voucher, that voucher must be used to purchase goods or services only and must not be redeemable, in part of in full, for cash. The cut-off point of &euro;500 is considered a reasonable level which allows a small benefit to be paid without tax but does not allow this exemption for more substantial benefits.</p></reply>

It should be noted that Vouchers that are deemed electronic money, within the meaning of the EMR are excluded from the Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Act 2019. This is on the basis that they are already regulated under the EMR, which transposes the Electronic Money Directive (EMD) 2009/110/EC into Irish law. </p>  <p>  The EMD is a maximum harmonization directive, meaning that, EU countries may not introduce rules that are stricter than those set in the directive. As per Regulation 52 of the EMR electronic money products have to be redeemable at any time and cannot have an expiry date.</p>  <p>  In particular regulated firms must design and sell products that are suitable to their customers&rsquo; needs, are capable of delivering the promised benefits, with key risks and charges with respect to those products appropriately disclosed. Specifically, Regulation 74-76 of the European Union Payment Services Regulations 2019 (PSR) sets out the specific requirements regarding the information that is required to be shared by electronic money institutions with payment service users including in relation to charges.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that while it does not comment on the supervision of specific firms, the Central Bank&rsquo;s expectation is that, all regulated firms, including electronic money institutions, comply with their regulatory obligations. The Central Bank also expects regulated firms to take a customer-focused approach and to act in their customers' best interests at all times.</p>  <p>  It may be useful to know that as part of the European Commission&rsquo;s Retail Payments Strategy, which was launched in September 2020, the Commission has under taken to align the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the Electronic Money Directive frameworks by including the issuance of e-money as a payment service in PSD2. This will ensure greater consistency in the various pieces of legislation on retail payments and promote robust supervision and oversight of firms in the relevant sectors.</p>  <p>  This work will be carried out as part of the review of PSD2, which is expected to begin later this year. Officials in my Department will consider the issue of reducing balance fees as part of future discussions on the Electronic Money Directive.</p></reply>

In accordance with the general rules of the relief, any portion of costs which have been reimbursed will not be eligible for relief under section 469 TCA 1997.</p><p>However, section 118(5K) TCA 1997 provides that, subject to a number of conditions, a charge to tax will not arise where an employer provides an employee with a COVID-19 test. This exemption was provided for in Finance Act 2021 and applies with effect from 1 January 2021. </p><p>One of the conditions attached to this exemption is that any testing provided by the employer must be a necessary requirement to enable the employee to perform his or her duties of employment. This may include, for example, scenarios where an employee is required to undergo COVID-19 testing in advance of his or her attendance at the workplace.</p><p>Alternatively, where an employer reimburses an employee for any costs that he or she has incurred in obtaining a COVID-19 test independently, a charge to tax on same will not apply where the expense incurred by the employee is vouched and the conditions attached to section 118(5K) TCA 1997 are met. </p><p>Further details in relation to income tax relief for health expenses are set out on the Revenue website and in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-12, both of which may be found at the links below:</p><p>- Revenue website: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/health-expenses/index.aspx</i></p><p>- Tax and Duty Manual: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-12.pdf</i>.</p><p>For the purposes of clarity, references above to Covid-19 tests include antigen tests.

In this context, the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very significant tax relief that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. It was time-bound in duration, ceasing in 2016.</p>  <p>  Under the accompanying legislation, the payment of the levy was treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, were entitled to adjust current or prospective benefits payable. It should also be noted that the performance of private pension funds is primarily a commercial matter and is contingent on market circumstances and other external factors.</p>  <p>  The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and ensuing employment in that sector. The value of the funds raised by way of the levies have been used to protect and create jobs and this in turn has helped to support the improving financial and economic position of the State. </p>  <p>  Taxpayers who may have ultimately borne the impact of the levy will have since benefited from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets, including the substantial income tax package as part of Budget 2021. Accordingly, it is within context that I can confirm that there are no plans to carry out a review of the levy.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the Directors of the respective banks to ensure these rules have been properly applied.</p>  <p>  The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

As the Deputy may be aware, as Minister for Finance, I have no role in the commercial decisions made by any bank in the State. This includes banks in which the State has a shareholding. The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally.</p>  <p>  The requirement for Banks to prepare financial statements is laid out in the Companies Acts. The Director of Corporate Enforcement has widespread powers and functions in relation to potential breaches of the Companies Acts.?</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy have concerns in this regard, she may wish to refer such concerns to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as the Companies Acts come under its remit.</p></reply>

The objectives and requirements of the Reserve are set out in the Brexit Adjustment Reserve Regulation which came into force on 11 October 2021.</p>  <p>  The overall objective of the Reserve is to provide financial support to the most affected Member States, regions and sectors to deal with the adverse consequences of Brexit. </p>  <p>  To qualify for funding, expenditure must be incurred between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2023, and a direct link to the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU must be demonstrated. </p>  <p>  Member States are required to establish a Designated Body responsible for the management and oversight of funding and the required reporting and funding application to the Commission.  In Ireland this function lies in my Department. </p>  <p>  Approximately 80% of funding will be paid to Member States as pre-financing in three tranches over the period 2021 to 2023.  I am pleased that on 6 December 2021 the European Commission approved the payment of Ireland&rsquo;s first tranche of &euro;361.5 million, making us the first Member State to receive such approval.</p>  <p>  The allocation of BAR resources is being aligned with the annual Estimates process, which has been the vehicle for allocating Brexit resources since the UK referendum on EU membership in 2016.</p></reply>

I recognise the essential role that the local media plays and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in sharing reliable and relevant local news and bringing communities together.</p>  <p>  Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have met key stakeholders including NewsBrands Ireland, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  In relation to the local radio sector, I have received quarterly reports from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) analysing the impact of COVID-19 on the commercial radio sector.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers and local radio stations, such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p>  <p>  Support for the production of audiovisual and audio content for Irish audiences is provided through the Sound and Vision Scheme, which is established under the Broadcasting Act 2009, administered by the BAI. The Sound and Vision Scheme is funded through the allocation of 7% of net licence fee receipts per annum. Under section 156 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, I as Minister may allocate additional Exchequer funding to the Sound and Vision Scheme.</p>  <p>  In recognition of challenges facing the independent radio sector and its important contribution to society as a whole, in December 2020 I allocated additional funding of &euro;4.9 million for the Sound and Vision Scheme, &euro;2.5 million of which was to support the independent radio sector and &euro;1.4 million to support the live music sector. The &euro;2.5 million was awarded in April 2021 as part of a &euro;2.58 million Sound and Vision Scheme funding round to support all 32 radio stations in the independent radio sector. This funding was in additional to traditional Sound and Vision Scheme funding rounds.</p>  <p>  The loss the local media sector &ndash; newspapers and radio - has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has also been addressed by the public health advertising placed by the Government and HSE totalling at least &euro;17.14m from March 2020 to date. A breakdown of this spend is as follows:  </p>  <p>  - &euro;6.71m on regional / local radio and &euro;3.67m on regional/local print in 2020, and </p>  <p>  - &euro;4.88m on regional / local radio and &euro;1.88m on regional/local print in 2021.</p>  <p>  I am also ensuring that advertising campaigns organised by my Department include a local print media element. Last year, the campaign for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, a day of free creative events for young people, included a spend of &euro;187,000 on local print advertising.</p>  <p>  My officials continue to engage with relevant stakeholders in order to explore the issues arising and build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector at present and appropriate solutions for the future.</p></reply>

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. HAP recipients are required to set up automatic electronic rent payment arrangements.</p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. </p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q3 2021, the scheme had a 98% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 emergency, the HAP Debt Management Process (DMP) was suspended from March 2020 and partially re-commenced in October 2020. This meant non-payment of differential rent by a tenant during that time did not affect payments to HAP landlords. Tenants were, however, expected to continue to pay their rent with supports available for those financially impacted by Covid measures in place.</p>  <p>  The payment of HAP in respect of tenancies that had already entered the cessation stage of the DMP prior to the suspension of the process in March 2020 remained suspended, and local authorities were advised to proceed in ceasing those tenancies. In 2020, 18 tenancies have had their HAP support ceased for non-payment of differential rent, after the debt management process was fully completed.</p>  <p>  Following on from the successful roll out of the COVID vaccine programme and the reopening of society it was agreed to re-instate the full DMP, from September 2021. From 6 September 2021, the debt management process as applied pre COVID was applicable to tenants entering into arrears from that date. For tenants in arrears prior to that date, these tenants were given additional time to engage with the HAP SSC Debt Management Unit to assist them in remaining in the HAP scheme and preventing the suspension/cessation of their landlord&rsquo;s HAP payment. In 2021, 42 tenancies had their HAP support ceased for non-payment of differential rent, after the debt management process was fully completed. Information on cessations is collated on a quarterly basis, therefore, 2022 data is not yet available.</p>  <p>  In relation to the average time in, and amount of, arrears outstanding at the time of cessation, the SSC advise that this information is not readily available from their "live" operating system. Information is only recorded on the current balance, which could have changed since the tenancy was ceased, if a write-off of the amount outstanding had been approved or if the tenant began to pay off the arrears.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants in arrears should contact their local authority and the HAP SSC to discuss the options that are available to them to ensure the continuation of their HAP support.</p></reply>

Dwellings under the scheme come from a number of different sources including private owners, Part V and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). </p><p>Long term lease arrangements, including the enhanced lease, of privately owned dwellings can be entered into by either local authorities or AHBs. Under these arrangements the local authority or AHB acts as the landlord to the tenant. The terms of these agreements are set out in standard template agreements provided by my Department which must be used by all local authorities and AHBs. Agreements may be entered into for periods of between 10 to 25 years in duration.</p><p>Under the long term leasing arrangement, the dwelling can be sold by the owner during the lease term, subject to the leasehold interest and the consent of the local authority or AHB. As such, the owner of the property changes but the lease, and the tenant, are unaffected. There is no current option to purchase the property under the long term lease or enhanced lease arrangements; however, an option to purchase may have been included in some long term leases by local authorities in the early stages of the leasing programme. </p><p>It is a matter for each local authority to identify appropriate units for acquisition in line with the criteria set out in Circular 02/2022 Social Housing Acquisitions, which was issued in January 2022. My Department does not record details of social housing acquisitions that may have been previously covered by a lease agreement. </p><p>Details of the number of homes delivered under the Social Housing Leasing Programme from 2020 and up to the end of Q3 2021, broken down by local authority, can be found on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/?referrer=http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision#leasing</i></p><p>Leasing delivery data for Q4 2021 is being collated at present and will be published as soon as that process is finalised. </p><p>A breakdown by local authority of the total spend on long-term leasing in 2021 to the end of Q3 can be found in Table 1 below:</p><p><b>Table 1: Total Long-term Leasing Spend &ndash; End Q3 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><div><b>Local Authority</b></div></th>       <th><div><b>Spend</b></div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow County Council</td>       <td>&euro;293,734.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan County Council</td>       <td>&euro;89,082.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare County Council</td>       <td>&euro;846,784.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City Council</td>       <td>&euro;876,615.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County Council</td>       <td>&euro;252,688.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DLR County Council</td>       <td>&euro;1,350,900.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal County Council</td>       <td>&euro;964,313.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City Council</td>       <td>&euro;3,384,367.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal County Council</td>       <td>&euro;2,641,550.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City Council</td>       <td>&euro;26,741.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County Council</td>       <td>&euro;390,501.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry County Council</td>       <td>&euro;773,744.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare County Council</td>       <td>&euro;1,335,992.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny County Council</td>       <td>&euro;134,463.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois County Council</td>       <td>&euro;387,285.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim County Council</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td>       <td>&euro;948,646.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford County Council</td>       <td>&euro;25,250.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth County Council</td>       <td>&euro;1,725,434.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo County Council</td>       <td>&euro;15,817.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath County Council</td>       <td>&euro;666,656.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan County Council</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly County Council</td>       <td>&euro;10,980.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon County Council</td>       <td>&euro;17,749.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo County Council</td>       <td>&euro;261,760.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin County Council</td>       <td>&euro;3,641,597.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary County Council</td>       <td>&euro;598,077.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council</td>       <td>&euro;618,649.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath County Council</td>       <td>&euro;133,699.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council</td>       <td>&euro;688,483.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow County Council</td>       <td>&euro;133,582.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;23,235,138.00</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The figures provided in Table 1 above covers spend in respect of Long-term Local Authority Leasing, AHB Private Leasing and the Enhanced Leasing Scheme. </p><p>Under Long Term Leasing arrangements; internal maintenance and repairs of social housing leased properties are the responsibility of the local authority or AHB entering into the lease, while structural maintenance of the property remains the responsibility of the property owner over the life of the lease agreement.

The Group's aim is to recommend measures to ensure an equality of outcome between those who receive water services from Irish Water and non-Irish Water customers. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the review provide for a two-strand approach. Strand 1 is considering the composition and distribution of funding for the upcoming Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme.  Strand 2 is considering the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the Rural Water Sector. </p>  <p>  The Working Group is currently finalising a report on Strand 1 of its deliberations. The report, to be finalised in coming weeks, will make recommendations on the measures to be considered for funding under the upcoming multi-annual programme. Once I have received the report and had an opportunity to consider its recommendations, I expect to announce details of the programme priorities and an invitation to local authorities to submit bids will follow. </p></reply>

By the end of 2020, Irish Aid had allocated over &euro;113 million in assistance to education.  The final outturn for 2021 is currently being calculated.  These funds are supporting students in developing countries to complete primary and secondary education, as well as to move on to technical and vocational training or higher education.  </p>  <p>  Irish Aid&rsquo;s education support has a strong focus on equity and inclusion.  Irish Aid puts a particular emphasis on girls&rsquo; education, knowing that girls, especially as they reach adolescence, are more likely to have their education cut short. In 2020 Ireland launched a global call to action &ndash; the Drive for Five - calling on all governments and stakeholders to commit to transformative actions to get all adolescent girls into school and learning in safe, supportive, and healthy environments.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education across the globe. Schools closed in 194 countries and 1.6 billion students missed on classroom instruction, many for months. During the early days of the pandemic, Irish Aid helped countries to ensure continuity of education for all children, especially girls. We are now supporting partners to safely reopening schools, with improved facilities, and interventions to make up for learning losses. </p>  <p>  The Global Partnership for Education (GPE) is Irish Aid&rsquo;s largest education partner and is supporting over 67 developing countries to sustain learning and mitigate the education impacts of the pandemic.  Ireland contributed &euro;25 million to the GPE between 2018 and 2020.  Last year, I made a new pledge to contribute &euro;60 million to the GPE over five years, &euro;10 million of which is earmarked for girls' education. </p>  <p>  Children and youth in humanitarian emergencies or protracted crises are most vulnerable to missing education or dropping out completely. Ireland has a history of supporting education in emergencies, particular for Palestinian children through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.  Irish Aid also funds non-governmental organisations to provide education support for refugee and displaced children in the Sahel, in Central African Republic, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Jordan, South Sudan, Sudan and Somalia.</p>  <p>  In A Better World, the government committed to scaling up our support for education in emergencies.  In 2019 Ireland joined Education Cannot Wait, a global fund dedicated to supporting education in situations of war, forced displacement, natural and man-made, disasters and pandemics. To date, Ireland has contributed &euro;8.85 million to Education Cannot Wait, and has committed an additional &euro;3 million in 2022.</p></reply>

The Movement comprises the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (ICRC) and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC).  The IFRC is the federation of 192 national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  Organisations within the Movement share common principles but are not linked hierarchically.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the ICRC have a Memorandum of Understanding for 2021-2022, under which Ireland commits to maintain its core funding of the ICRC at a minimum of &euro;10 million annually.  Irish Aid provided &euro;16.1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) last year: in addition to the core funding of &euro;10 million, my Department, through Irish Aid, also funded the ICRC&rsquo;s programming in Syria (&euro;2.5 million), Ethiopia (&euro;1 million), Burkina Faso (&euro;500,000), Chad (&euro;500,000), Mali (&euro;500,000), Niger (&euro;500,000) and Mozambique (&euro;600,000). </p>  <p>  Separately, Ireland contributed over &euro;2.3 million to the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) in 2021.

The build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine is a matter of great concern. It is important that dialogue be maintained, with the primary goal of de-escalating tensions in the region. In this regard, I welcome the intensive diplomatic efforts which have occurred in recent weeks, aimed at defusing tensions. These include bilateral discussions between the US and Russia, between NATO and Russia, and at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. As a participating State in the OSCE, Ireland is pleased to express solidarity with Ukraine and seek a peaceful de-escalation of tensions in that forum.</p><p>Ireland has repeatedly reaffirmed its support for Ukraine at United Nations Security Council meetings on Ukraine, including at Arria formula meetings. We have also stressed our non-recognition of the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, encouraged full, secure and unimpeded access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, and called for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements. </p><p>EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Ukraine at the Foreign Affairs Council on 13 December, in Gymnich formation on 13 and 14 January, and again at the Foreign Affairs Council of 24 January. In my own remarks, I have consistently underlined the need for strong and unified messaging from the EU. In remarks after the December Foreign Affairs Council, High Representative Borrell made clear that aggression against Ukraine, will come with political consequences and with a high economic cost for Russia. This has been re-enforced in Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions on 24 January, which state that preparatory work has accelerated on restrictive measures in case of further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine. The Council Conclusions also condemn Russia&rsquo;s continued aggressive actions and threats against Ukraine, and call on Russia to de-escalate.</p><p>I and my counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Council have dedicated significant time to the security situation in Ukraine this year, including through engagements with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. I also discussed these matters with Minister Kuleba when I travelled to Kyiv on 23 August to represent Ireland at the International Crimea Platform, a diplomatic initiative by Ukraine to seek a peaceful end to the illegal Russian occupation of the peninsula.</p></reply>

Over the past two years, my Department, through the Irish Aid programme, has invested &euro;200 million in global public health with further investment to come in 2022 of at least another &euro;100 million. This includes COVID-19 specific response measures, and ongoing work to strengthen health systems for the prevention and treatment of pre-existing conditions. A strong response is essential for our health at home, as well in low income countries where the impact of the pandemic is reversing hard won gains and deepening social and economic inequalities.</p>  <p>  The WHO has set a global vaccination target of 70% by the middle of 2022. COVAX, as the main global facility for procurement and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, is performing well. As of Jan 16, COVAX has shipped 1 billion doses to 144 countries. Unfortunately, as long as a significant proportion of the world&rsquo;s population remains unvaccinated and without full access to testing, tracking and treatment, COVID-19 will remain a threat to lives and livelihoods.</p>  <p>  In 2021, Irish Aid gave &euro;8.5 million in to the COVAX facility to enable the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution to low- and middle-income countries. Last week, I announced an additional Irish contribution of &euro;5 million to COVAX. This brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall contribution to COVAX to date to &euro;13.5 million.</p>  <p>  This latest award to COVAX will facilitate the advance procurement of further doses for low income countries. Critically, it will also be used to provide equipment and technical support to low income countries to boost their ability to roll out large, safe, and rapid vaccination campaigns, including of the 5 million vaccines from Ireland's supply which the Government has pledged to COVAX.</p></reply>

In addition, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has facilitated the reallocation of pay savings in the Defence Vote to fund capital projects.</p>  <p>  Many of the Defence Equipment projects are complex, multi-annual and have long lead-in times, so the funding provided by the National Development Plan will enable the Defence Forces to plan, prioritise and deliver scheduled projects over the coming years.

These infrastructure projects are being undertaken as part of the 5 year Defence Forces Infrastructure Development Plan. This Plan supports progress across a  broad suite of Defence Forces built infrastructure projects and will ensure that the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, are enabled to contribute fully to their assigned roles.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to the Naval Service, following consideration by a high-level civil military group, a document on the regeneration of the Naval Service was submitted to me in 2021 looking at initiatives that would restore the capacity of the Naval Service.

Stage one commenced in January 2021 and focused primarily on the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s partnership with Science Foundation Ireland (SFI). The partnership created the SFI &ndash; Defence Organisation Innovation Challenge which is an innovative programme with the overarching ambition to develop new technologies, aligned with our National Defence Policy and supporting Defence Forces capability requirements, that also have the potential to deliver significant societal impacts within Ireland.  Challenges in five areas plus an open challenge on disruptive technologies, were presented to Irish research institutions.  These proposals were then judged by an international panel of researchers in line with best academic practice.  </p>  <p>  The Challenge entered the concept phase in January 2022, where a number of research teams were selected by the international review panel to move forward within the Challenge.  This concept phase will be launched by me and my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in February 2022.  </p>  <p>  The RTI unit is in the process of moving into stage two in its development.  The focus during this stage will be on introducing applied research and development for capability developments, embedding a culture of innovation within the Defence Organisation as well as accessing international funding activities which will deliver long term strategic benefits.  A key focus of the RTI Unit going forward will be to support Irish research institutes and enterprise in securing funding from the European Defence Fund and also accessing the supply chains of major defence research and industry actors in the EU including as members of EU wide consortia.</p>  <p>  The Department, through the RTI unit, contributed &euro;250,000 to the SFI &ndash; Defence Organisation Innovation Challenge in 2021.  All other Unit activities were undertaken within the normal operating budget of the Department.  The funding requirement for 2022 will be met from within the Defencw Vote.  </p>  <p>  The unit was established in January 2021 with a whole time equivalent staffing of 0.4 civilian and one military.  The current whole time equivalent staffing for the unit is 0.8 civilian and two military. </p></reply>

The independent Commission on the Defence Forces was established by Government in December 2020.  The Commission&rsquo;s overall approach is guided and informed by both the White Paper on Defence 2015 and the White Paper Update 2019.  The work of the Commission will inform the future development of the Defence Forces and it's terms of reference encompasses the following matters;</p><p><i>- Structure and size of the Defence Forces encompassing consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing. </i></p><p><i>- Leveraging the capabilities of the Reserve Defence Force in their supports to the Permanent Defence Force and make service in the RDF more attractive.</i></p><p><i>- Governance and high level command and control structures in the Defence Forces. </i></p><p><i>- The evolution of remuneration systems and structures in the Defence Forces. </i></p><p><i>- A strategic perspective on HR policies and associated strategies, recruitment, retention and career progression.  </i></p><p>As part of a broad consultation process, the Commission invited submissions from individuals and organisations on matters  related to its terms of reference.  The Commission received nearly 500 submissions, all of which have been published on their website.  </p><p>I understand that the Commission has met with a broad stakeholder group including the Defence Forces Representative Associations, commissioned and enlisted members of the Defence Forces, senior officials and personnel from my Department and the Defence Forces as well as other groups.  Members of the Commission conducted site visits to a number military locations across the country, meeting nearly 1,000 military personnel.  </p><p>The Chairman of the Commission Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll met with members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in April to discuss the on-going work of the Commission.  The Commission also held two webinars, one in conjunction with the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) and one in conjunction with the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA).</p><p>The  work  of the independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins this Government's commitment to ensuring that the  Defence Forces are fit for purpose, in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030.  </p><p>The Commission are finalising their work with a view to completing the Report as soon as possible.The Commission's Report will be fully considered at that point.  </p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website <i>www.energyineducation.ie. </i></p><p>which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p><p>In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  </p><p>The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan. </p><p>The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme</p></reply>

This has been the case since the foundation of the State and the importance of the teaching of both languages in this way has been re-affirmed on a number of occasions by the State, including most recently in the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030</i>. </p><p>Recent changes to the Irish curriculum both at primary level and at junior cycle are informed by the principles of inclusion and the benefits of bilingualism for all pupils.

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, in consultation with parents, having regard to the ethos of the school. Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. </p><p>The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;<i>this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships&rsquo;</i>.</p><p>In April 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of RSE in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland. </p><p>The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.</p><p>The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. </p><p>The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. These resources cover all topics including many of the topics that have been raised in the media during recent days as important for young people's education - there are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationship, how to interact safely and respectfully (both online and face-to-face), the influence of the media (including pornography) on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.</p><p>The NCCA Toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these and other related topics within the SPHE classroom. The Toolkit provides practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.</p><p>In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle. It is expected that a revised Junior Cycle specification will be completed by the end of 2022, following a period of public consultation. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow immediately afterwards. </p><p>In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of fostering young people's self-awareness and self-esteem and building the foundational skills and dispositions needed for building caring and healthy relationships (including respectful communication, showing empathy, appreciating difference). The new specifications will also foster skills needed for dealing with challenging times. Consent education will be included within the learning outcomes for RSE, across all levels, based on the principle that consent is a core dimension of all healthy interpersonal relationships. </p></reply>

Social insurance schemes are paid to those covered by the Social Insurance Fund, whereas social assistance payments are designed to support those most in need and are based on a means-test.  However, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the Irish social welfare system. </p>  <p>  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, even if the person experiences more than one contingency at the same time, generally, they can receive only one of those payments to help meet the person&rsquo;s income needs. This means that a person will not be able to claim Widow&rsquo;s Pension, Widower's Pension or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension and Illness Benefit at the same time. </p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that people might be eligible to claim one of the supports below in addition to their Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension. </p>  <p>  Working Family Payment (WFP) is a weekly means-tested tax-free payment available to employees with children. A person can receive Working Family Payment (if they meet the criteria) and get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension at the same time. Full details are available and updated regularly on the www.gov.ie website. The Widow's, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension is assessed as means.</p>  <p>  A person might also be eligible to receive Living Alone Increase, Fuel Allowance or Household Benefits Package depending on their living circumstances and their age.</p>  <p>  Supplementary Welfare Allowance is available to people struggling financially. This is a means-tested payment. It is administered by this Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service and can be accessed by customers through their local Intreo office. The Department may also make an Exceptional Needs Payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income. </p>  <p>  Full details of the above and further rules and guidelines are available and updated regularly on the www.gov.ie website. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to keep the range of supports under review. However, changing the underlying one person, one payment principle would involve significant additional expenditure which could prove unsustainable in the long-term, and which would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

This is not surprising given the changes to the eligibility rules for OFP and the introduction of the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition Payment (JST) during that period.</p>  <p>  Budget 2012 included a number of significant reforms to the OFP scheme. In particular, the age of children in respect of whom a person could qualify for OFP was reduced.  Originally, a person could receive OFP until their youngest child was aged 18 years or 22 if they remained in full-time education.  The reduction in the age threshold of the youngest child was implemented on a phased basis during the period 2013 to 2015.   Once the reforms were fully implemented a lone parent&rsquo;s entitlement to OFP would continue until their youngest child&rsquo;s 7th birthday (subject to continuing to satisfy the other qualifying conditions).  </p>  <p>  The Jobseekers&rsquo; Transitional Payment was introduced to provide income support for lone parents with older children.  It can be paid until the youngest child&rsquo;s 14th birthday.  These changes mean that lone parents whose youngest child was age 7 or over, but under age 14 would have moved from OFP to JST during the period in question.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This analysis estimates the (pre-Covid-19) wage bill.  This data is assessed to be a better predictor of likely wage costs during Covid-19, given the distorting impact of both public health measures and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on pay costs. </p><p>Using available data for directly employed staff working with children on average hours worked, average wages, including PRSI and holiday pay, costs were derived. The cost per week of directly employed staff working with children is &euro;11.5m. Using a similar methodology for managers and other ancillary staff who do not work with children, the cost is &euro;1.9m per week. Taken together, this amounts to &euro;13.4m. Applying an uplift to the number of staff at a similar rate across a number of years pre-Covid-19 (3%) and staff pay increases (1% in 2021, based on initial analysis of 2020/21 Sector Profile data; and 3% in 2022, based on typical pre-Covid-19 annual increases in pay), the weekly cost of directly employed staff is estimated to be &euro;14.8m in 2022. Approximately, 38% of staff work 38 weeks per year. It is assumed the remaining 62% hold 52 week contracts.

I have no direct role in the matter. </p><p>I have, however, discussed this matter recently with the Commissioner and I know he is committed to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na upholding the highest standards of personal behaviour in this area.  I understand that the Garda Foundation Training Programme, which leads to the BA Applied Policing Programme, and is undertaken by all Garda Trainees and Probationer Garda&iacute;, has comprehensive content and training regarding professional behaviours and sexual crimes. This training is under continuous review and development in order to remain current and relevant to policing and societal needs. </p><p>The training addresses sexual crimes and victims of sexual crimes, of all gender types. This education is threaded through the 'Policing with Communities' module<s>s</s>within the Programme, and captures how Garda&iacute; deal with domestic violence, sexual abuse and other sexual and violent offences. </p><p>The objective of the 'Policing with Communities' module is to equip the students with the personal and professional expertise, to proactively police a modern and diverse society, and while being responsive to the needs of its vulnerable members.  </p><p>In addition, the Children First Act 2015 and Children First National Guidance for Protection and Welfare of Children 2017, is delivered to Garda Trainees within the Foundation Training Programme.  It examines the responsibilities of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the area of Child Abuse Investigations, as well as the legislation and offences pertaining to all sexual crimes and domestic violence.</p><p>The BA Applied Policing Programme also covers two on-line presentations on Hate Crime and Diversity, creating awareness in these important areas, with diversity training examining, recognising, acknowledging and respecting differences.  These differences includes issues such as gender, marital status, family status, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, race and membership of minority ethnic groups.</p><p>The Foundation Training Team is currently examining the introduction of the topic of &quot;active consent&quot; into the module and this will be developed and integrated in 2022.  Garda College instructors have undergone specific training in this area and are currently developing content for blended learning in this area. </p><p>Separately, I am informed by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that the Irish Prison Service College tutors work closely with psychologists from the Irish Prison Service Psychology Service in designing, delivering and reviewing training in relation to gender focused sexual education in order to achieve the Irish Prison Service strategic objectives and to demonstrate best practice in accordance with international human rights treaty obligations and recommendations.</p><p>Currently, Recruit Prison Officers receive training on the impact of gender based violence on female prisoners as part of a trauma informed approach to prisoner care. With the ending of COVID restrictions, it is intended to extend this training to audiences at middle and senior manager level.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service is committed to incorporating ongoing developments in gender focused sexual education into all related training modules in order to ensure that it is culturally relevant and sensitive, psychologically informed and that it addresses gender identity, sexual behaviours, communication skills, empathy, mutual respect and diversity, both in relation to staff and prisoners.</p><p>It will also interest the Deputy to know that I am leading work on a new whole of government domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence strategy. The new plan will be the most ambitious to date and will be structured around the four pillars of Prevention, Protection, Prosecution and Co-ordinated Policies.

Section 5 of the 1986 Act provides that a foreign divorce may only be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled on the date the divorce proceedings were instituted. The determination of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; includes an assessment of the intention of the person to remain indefinitely in the foreign jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  Recognition of foreign divorces granted prior to the coming into operation of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 is governed by common law domicile rules which are now consistent with those in the 1986 Act.</p>  <p>  The recognition in Ireland of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment granted in another EU Member State on or after 1 March 2001 is governed by EU Council Regulation 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (also known as the Brussels II bis or the Brussels IIa Regulation). This Regulation provides for EU judicial co-operation and recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border matrimonial matters. Under the Regulation, divorces, legal separations or marriage annulments granted in all EU States, with the exception of Denmark, are entitled to recognition if granted in accordance with jurisdictional criteria specified in the Regulation. Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition. The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 no longer applies to the recognition of divorces covered by the Regulation.</p>  <p>  Part 19 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 makes provision for the recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the United Kingdom or Gibraltar and has been in operation since 11.00 p.m. on 31 December 2020.</p>  <p>  Where there is an issue as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition, section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 allows a person to apply to court for a declaration as to marital status, including a declaration as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition in the State. </p>  <p>  The Thirty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Act 2019 was signed into law on 11 June 2019 following its approval by the people in a referendum on 24 May 2019. </p>  <p>  That Act deleted the following subsection from Article 41.3 of the Constitution:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; No person whose marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage so dissolved.&rdquo;,</p>  <p>  and substituted that subsection with the following:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; Provision may be made by law for the recognition under the law of the State of a dissolution of marriage granted under the civil law of another state.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The amendment will permit a future change in the law to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces.</p>  <p>  The Law Reform Commission, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform, is examining the recognition of foreign divorces. When the expert report of the Law Reform Commission is completed, it will provide valuable guidance for the development of proposals for legislation on the recognition of foreign divorces.</p></reply>

While flashing is a term we are all familiar with, the concept of cyberflashing is relatively new.</p>  <p>  There are, however, a number of offences already on the statute book which criminalise behaviours that can be described as cyberflashing. The existing offence for flashing, contained in section 45(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2017 is not restricted to physical places and would also apply in the online context.  </p>  <p>  In addition, it is an offence under section 45(3) of that Act to intentionally engage in offensive conduct of a sexual nature. &ldquo;Offensive conduct of a sexual nature&rdquo; means any behaviour of a sexual nature which, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to cause fear, distress or alarm to any person who is, or might reasonably be expected to be, aware of any such behaviour. </p>  <p>  A person convicted of an offence under either of these provisions would be liable on summary conviction to a fine or up to six months imprisonment, or on indictment for up to two years imprisonment.</p>  <p>  If such images are sent by phone or text message it may constitute an offence under Section 13(1)(a) of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 (as amended by the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007) which makes it an offence to send by telephone (including by text message) any message that is grossly offensive, or is indecent, obscene or menacing.</p>  <p>  The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 contains an offence of distributing, publishing, or sending a grossly offensive communication with intent to cause harm.  Under this offence, harm is caused by seriously interfering with a person&rsquo;s peace and privacy or by causing alarm or distress to the person.  The penalty for such a conviction can be an unlimited fine or up to two years imprisonment.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above offences, persistent cyberflashing may amount to harassment within the meaning of section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. </p></reply>

Pursuant to the Act, the Medical Council is the body responsible for the regulation of registered medical practitioners. The Minister does not have a role in relation to individual complaints received by the Medical Council and you will appreciate does not comment on specific cases or take a position on matters before the courts.</p>  <p>  Section 52 of the Act provides for the procedures for a registered medical practitioner to apply to have his or her name removed from the register such that that person may no longer practise in the State. Section 52 prescribes the circumstances under which that removal can happen. The Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Act 2020, includes a provision which is yet to be commenced, amending section 52(3) to state that the Council may consider applications by registered medical practitioners who are the subject of a complaint which has not been disposed of or otherwise dealt with under the Act, &ldquo;if the Council is satisfied that the removal of the practitioner&rsquo;s registration would not be contrary to the public interest&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The rationale for this amendment was to deal with a small cohort of cases where the Council is satisfied that the removal of the practitioner&rsquo;s registration would not be contrary to the public interest &ndash; this might include, for example (but is not limited to), a registrant against whom a complaint has been opened due to the fact that s/he is subject to disciplinary proceedings in another jurisdiction, who may have never practised in this jurisdiction and may never intend to practise in this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  Department officials are considering the High Court Judicial Review decision ([2021] IEHC 776) referenced in the Deputy&rsquo;s correspondence and any implications arising from that judgment, including whether any additional measures are required for the protection of the public.</p></reply>

It is likely that demand for testing for public health purposes will remain high in the coming period, particularly given the very high current infection rates in the community and the impacts arising in relation to Omicron.</p><p>In addition to running a very comprehensive community PCR testing programme, a number of serial testing PCR programmes, and PCR testing in acute hospital services, the HSE, under the guidance and direction of NPHET and the Department of Health operates a number of programmes involving supply of antigen tests, free of charge, to participants. The HSE focus is on supporting programmes with a clearly defined public health purpose. These programmes involve supply of antigen tests, free of charge, to all symptomatic persons aged from 4 to 39; to close contacts, of all ages, of confirmed cases; supporting the Department of Education in supplying antigen tests to children in primary schools as part of a pod in which there was a confirmed case of COVID-19; supporting the Department of Agriculture in the antigen testing programme in food processing facilities and for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in community settings, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. While the focus remains on supporting those programmes with a clearly defined public health purpose, the HSE is also required to prioritise the available stock, supply chain and operational capacity in supporting these ongoing programmes and on continuing the national testing programme for public health reasons.</p><p>More widely, the Government&rsquo;s objective has been to ensure the widespread availability of antigen tests, that are CE marked for self-testing, at an affordable price level, for those people who wish to purchase their own. Following engagement by relevant Government Departments with leading retailers and wholesalers, there is increased competition in the market and the retail price of many of the available antigen tests for consumers are more affordable. While there is increasing competition in the international supply chain, the Government continues to keep affordability low with the implementation of a zero VAT rate for all Covid-19 test kits and ongoing review regarding availability.</p><p>A comprehensive, cross-Government communications campaign on the appropriate use of antigen tests, to ensure there is clear message to the general public on when and how they should be used has also been launched and guidance material has been published on the HSE website and on <i>gov.ie</i>. The HPSC has also published rapid antigen testing programme guidance. </p><p>The role of testing and contact tracing and public health advice relating to face masks, as part of the wider public health response, has been under ongoing review throughout the pandemic and will continue to be reviewed and amended in line with the epidemiological profile of the disease, its impact on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, the vaccination status of the population and ECDC guidance.</p></reply>

These arrangements include risk assessments, enhanced environmental hygiene, and pod like arrangements in day service locations. Mask wearing will remain in place in day services, except for those who are exempt from wearing a face covering.</p>  <p>  Since day services reopened after the Christmas break on January 4th 2022, the HSE has been closely monitoring the impact of the current COVID surge in the operation and delivery of disability day services. There are some staff shortages in day services due to staff being COVID positive or a COVID close contact. This has led to some day services operating at reduced levels or having to close for the period of staff quarantine/sick leave. There are also shortages within residential services, and some day service staff have been redeployed to cover residential staff rosters.</p>  <p>   The HSE continue to monitor the situation and the priority of the HSE and the Department remains the safe provision of adult day services. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-26a.401.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012600088#WRH05300"><p>Firstly I want to acknowledge the pain and suffering of people impacted by mesh complications. Given that there are legal proceedings ongoing I do not wish to comment unduly on these cases. </p>  <p>  The delegation of mesh claims to the State Claims Agency (SCA) is a technical matter that will not impact on how these claims are handled. The SCA has a statutory remit to manage personal injury claims on behalf of Delegated State Authorities including the Health Service Executive. The Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS) indemnifies hospitals (HSE and Voluntaries) in respect of clinical negligence actions against those hospitals by persons alleging personal injuries resulting from such negligence. CIS cover is confined to clinical acts and/or omissions and does not cover product liability exposures, i.e., where the personal injury is alleged to have occurred as a result of a product not being fit for purpose etc.</p>  <p>  The Transvaginal Mesh litigation, currently being handled by the Agency, involves allegations in relation to the product itself (the mesh, tape etc.) and allegations of clinical negligence i.e., practitioner error/faulty surgical technique. The CIS indemnifies the hospital in respect of alleged practitioner error, but it does not indemnify the hospital in respect of any product liability exposure that the hospital might have i.e., allegations that the product failed or was not fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency manages general indemnity claims, in named State authorities, as provided for in Delegation Orders under the National Treasury Management Act, under a Scheme known as the General Indemnity Scheme (GIS). Delegating the management of claims to the SCA ensures the efficient and effective management of claims and removes duplication of effort and legal costs where multiple State Authorities are defending a claim. Such claims relate to personal injuries, including bullying and harassment and third-party property damage claims, and their associated risks, against State authorities. Mass action claims and claims relating to product liability, where the latter have been specifically delegated to the SCA, are also dealt with under the GIS. </p>  <p>  An indemnity issue has arisen in some hospitals and in a minority of &lsquo;Mesh&rsquo; claims where the product manufacturer cannot be identified due to the relevant hospital charts not containing device/product labels. The Liability for Defective Products Act, 1991 states that where the manufacturer/producer of the product cannot be identified by taking reasonable steps, the supplier of the product (in this case, the hospital) is at risk of being found to be the producer of the product. Put simply, this means that the hospital could potentially be responsible for the product liability aspect of the &ldquo;mesh&rdquo; claim. As hospitals do not carry product liability cover, these hospitals could have an uninsured/un-indemnified liability exposure in the circumstances described above. Such a situation would benefit neither the hospital nor the claimant, and so I have acted to ensure that it does not arise. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that hospitals are not exposed to an uninsured liability and the financial exposure consequent upon that, Government agreed to the provision of general indemnity cover for the product liability elements of claims and the delegation of their management to the SCA, in a minority of cases where the manufacturer cannot be identified. This decision does not change the practical position with regard to the HSE - the SCA have been managing these claims to date, on behalf of the HSE on an administrative basis.</p></reply>

Since concerns about mesh complications came to the attention of the Department in late 2017, the ongoing priority focus for both the Department and the HSE has been to meet the care needs of women experiencing mesh complications.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been done and continues to progress in Ireland in relation to the safe use of mesh implants and ensuring that all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, multi-disciplinary and patient-centred care is a priority for the Minister and the Department.</p>  <p>  Regarding steps taken to improve services in Ireland, multidisciplinary specialist services, including trans-labial scanning facilities, are now available for women suffering from mesh complications through a national multidisciplinary mesh specialist service which was established in 2020 across two centres, Cork University Maternity Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin. These centres also have two National Mesh administrators, based in each centre, available to assist patients with their appointments and navigate the service.</p>  <p>  Women's health is a Government priority, as outlined in the Programme for Government. Budget 2022 and the HSE National Service Plan 2022 provide significant investment in services that are important to women, including gynaecology services. A Women&rsquo;s Health Fund is also provided for, which will support proposals arising from the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce to improve women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. </p></reply>

In response to this question, the IBTS advised of the following:</p><p>&quot;The IBTS has had a long standing contingency agreement with the NHSBT to supply blood in times of acute shortage. As outlined in the  IBTS business continuity plan, the point of contact is the  supply chain manager in NHSBT.There is a similar arrangement in place with the SNBTS for contingency testing of donor samples should there be a failure in testing at the NBC.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-26a.438.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012600089#WRJ02800"><p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p><p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p><p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p><p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p><p>  I have asked my officials to request the National Immunisation Advisory Committee consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p><p>  If NIAC concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.  </p></reply>

Decisions will be guided by the experience of the Gender Equality Assembly which completed earlier this year.  An independent researcher was appointed by the Assembly to monitor and record, amongst other things, the perceived deliberative quality of the Assembly.  This report, published in July 2021, will assist in decisions on future Assemblies use of virtual meetings.</p><p>By their very nature, citizens assemblies require large gatherings to be truly effective. Therefore, there has been an unavoidable delay in the establishment of the next citizens' assembly due to public health restrictions arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>The Department of Health continues to liaise with the Department of the Taoiseach on the timing and format of the proposed citizen assembly on drug use. It is envisaged that the remaining citizen assembly, including the citizen assembly on drug use, will be established after the Dublin mayor citizens' assembly has completed its work. The specific timing of each assembly has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>The Department of Health's approach to the citizen assembly on drugs use will be informed by the Government's health-led approach to people who use drugs, as outlined in the national drugs strategy. An important component of the health-led approach is the Health Diversion Programme. The Health Diversion Programme offers compassion, not punishment, to people who use drugs and connects them with health services and provides a pathway to recovery, thereby avoiding a criminal conviction. As outlined in the Programme for Government, the programme will be reviewed after the first full year of implementation to ensure that it is meeting all of it aims and to make any necessary changes. This review could usefully inform the deliberations of the citizen's assembly on drug use. </p><p>A strategic priority for the implementation of the national drugs strategy for 2021-2025 is to promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences. This will include the exchange of best practice with EU member states, as part of the<b></b>EU Drugs Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2025.</p><p>I believe that a citizen's assembly could usefully consider the learnings from the health diversion  programme and other similar alternatives to coercive sanctions. It could also inform the development of the next national drugs strategy, to replace the existing strategy in 2025. </p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended. The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  There are many, many individuals in our country who did so much during the pandemic. I and the Government is sincerely grateful for this commitment but it is appropriate that these public sector frontline healthcare workers get particular recognition. They exposed themselves to particular COVID-19 risks that did not exist in other work environments or those working from home. I am also deeply appreciative of all those frontline workers who worked in our nursing homes and hospices during this pandemic and that they also get similar recognition.</p>  <p>  Outside of the above recognition, the Government also notes that some private healthcare companies have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. I would encourage private healthcare companies that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the current medical card income thresholds are kept under regular review and any changes are considered in the context of Government policy, the annual budgetary estimates process and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

For this reason, the daily case number of PCR confirmed cases reported since 22<sup>nd</sup>December 2021 has been an estimate based on positive SARS-CoV-2 results uploaded to the HSE COVID Care Tracker the preceding day. These data are provisional and do not represent notified cases. They serve to provide an up-to-date picture of trends during this surge period.</p><p>The notification of cases on CIDR has continued.  However, publication of the HPSC&rsquo;s daily &lsquo;Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Ireland - 14 day report&rsquo; is currently paused given the increased reporting time and prioritisation of resources during this surge period. </p><p>This is the report which usually contains details of cases, hospitalisation and ICU admissions of children in the age groups 0-4 yrs, 5-12 yrs and 13-18 yrs.  Publication of this report will resume as soon as possible.  Uploads of this data to the COVID-19 Data Hub have also been paused. </p><p>Data on COVID-19 cases notified on CIDR in the age groups 0-4 yrs, 5-12 yrs and 13-18 yrs are currently being published on a weekly basis in the HPSC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Weekly Report on the Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Ireland&rsquo; <i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/surveillance/epidemiologyofcovid-19inirelandweeklyreports/</i>.</p><p>However, the HPSC note that <i>&lsquo;Due to the current surge in case numbers the overall reporting time (time from when a case is notified to when they are uploaded to CIDR) has increased since week 51. Therefore data on recent cases is subject to reporting delays and may not be complete.  A technical issue experienced over the Christmas weekend and reduced surveillance capacity over the Christmas period contributed to the increased reporting time. However, the current case numbers continue to exceed capacity leading to the increased reporting time. Work is ongoing among surveillance partners to increase capacity and reduce reporting time.&rsquo;</i>This means that data presented in the Weekly Epidemiology Report would be an underestimate.</p><p>The latest report was published on 19<sup>th</sup>January for Week 2 of 2022. During Week 2, 3,278 cases were notified on CIDR in the 0-4 yrs age group, 7,958 in the 5-12 yrs and 8,054 in the 13-18 yrs age group. As noted, this would be an underestimate. </p><p>More detailed analysis of cases in these age groups is published in the HPSC report &lsquo;Weekly Epidemiological Report on COVID-19 cases aged 0-18 years and COVID-19 mass testing in schools in Ireland&rsquo; <i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/surveillance/epidemiologyofcovid-19inirelandcasesaged0-18years/</i>.</p><p>Data on deaths by age group is published each week in the HPSC &lsquo;Weekly Deaths Report&rsquo;. As of the latest report (19<sup>th</sup>January 2022) a total of 8 COVID-19 related deaths have been notified in Ireland since the beginning of the pandemic who were aged under 25 years.  Due to the small number of persons who died due to COVID-19 in the age groups 0-25 years, this information is aggregated in order to protect patient confidentiality. <i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/surveillance/weeklyreportoncovid-19deathsreportedinireland/</i>.</p><p>While publication of daily data from CIDR notifications on hospitalisation and ICU admission by age group is currently paused (due to the surge issues noted above) the HSE&rsquo;s Daily Operations Update reports on the number of COVID-19 patients on site in the three Children&rsquo;s Hospitals .  As of the latest report (19<sup>th</sup>January) there were 11 COVID-19 patients admitted on site across the three CHI hospitals (7 CHI Crumlin, 2 CHI Temple Street and 2 CHI Tallaght).</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended. The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  There are many, many individuals in our country who did so much during the pandemic. I and the Government is sincerely grateful for this commitment but it is appropriate that these public sector frontline healthcare workers get particular recognition. They exposed themselves to particular COVID-19 risks that did not exist in other work environments or those working from home. I am also deeply appreciative of all those frontline workers who worked in our nursing homes and hospices during this pandemic and that they also get similar recognition.</p>  <p>  Outside of the above recognition, the Government also notes that some private healthcare companies have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. I would encourage private healthcare companies that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

The objectives of the measure are to lower the intensity of GHG emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd and to improve the genetic merit of the national beef herd through the collection of data and genotypes of selected animals which will allow for the application of genomic selection in the beef herd and to support beef farm incomes.</p>  <p>  In the initial years of the scheme (2014-2020), the negative genetic trends that were evident for maternal traits in the past were turned around and 22 KT of reductions have now been realised as result of the actions undertaken by farmers in program. Cumulative gains of 18 KT/year are now being realised as a result of the program, which is then projected to reduce GHG from the suckler herd by 180 KT in 2030 (i.e., some 5.4% of total emissions from the suckler herd at that stage, compared to a 2020 base year). Additional increases in this level of gain are now being sought by ICBF and Teagasc, through incorporation of direct measures of methane into the &euro;uro-Star Indexes. This is expected to deliver an additional 235 KT of gain, which would then equate to some 12.4% of total GHG from the national suckler herd. </p>  <p>  It is intended to continue with a breeding programme in the next CAP which will build on the gains of both the BDGP and the BEEP schemes and help realise the additional gains identified by Teagasc and ICBF.  </p>  <p>  The proposed Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme (SCES) will build on significant investments made to date under the Beef Data Genomics Programme (BDGP). </p>  <p>  Breeding programmes like the BDGP and the proposed SCEP will continue to play a crucial role in supporting breeding decisions which can help farmers to produce an animal of the required weight at a younger age, so that the improvements are fully reflected in the inventory. </p></reply>

Typical operations include the removal of non-native tree species and exotic invasive shrubs, the installation of stock and deer fencing, and the creation of planting coupes involving appropriate native species, to rejuvenate the woodland. NWSC also funds the replanting of recently clear-felled conifer stands, using native woodland, where reforestation with commercial conifer species would be inappropriate. </p><p>Regarding the latter, this approach was used on several demonstration sites under the Freshwater Pearl Mussel KerryLIFE Project. Overall, in order to be potentially eligible for funding, applications under NWSC must meet specific criteria designed to better focus effort on strategic areas, which include sensitive waterways. </p><p>In the last five years, 51 applicants have received funding for over 300 hectares of Native Woodland Conservation. It is safe to assume that a very high percentage of the sites involved areas directly adjoining a stream, river or lake. </p><p>A proportion of the projects funded involved the replacement of non-native conifers with native woodland in areas close to streams, rivers and lakes. </p></reply>

This is necessary in order</p>  <p>  to protect forests and to ensure that forestry operations are undertaken sustainably. </p>  <p>  When a forest owner seeks to clearfell an area, they must submit a felling licence application detailing the proposed activities, which are considered by my Department. Environmental legislation has led to strengthened controls on forestry operations, to ensure that important environmental considerations are fully considered during the assessment of felling licence applications. This has included a greater focus on consultation with relevant bodies, the application of various procedures and the requirement for applicants on occasion to provide further information.</p>  <p>  Felling licence applications detail the owner&rsquo;s intention for their forest following clearfell. The permanent removal of forests is permitted in certain circumstances where these forests may be incompatible with the conservation of protected habitats and species. However, in other circumstances, the conversion from conifer to a native woodland and open habitat may be more appropriate than forest removal for biodiversity or water protection. The Felling and Reforestation Policy document provides further information on the range of options available to felling licence applicants.</p>  <p>  As deforestation is not listed as an &lsquo;exempted development&rsquo; in the Planning &amp;amp; Development Acts or Regulations and as there is a mandatory threshold set out in Schedule 5, Part 2, Paragraph 1(d)(iii) of the Regulations, which requires deforestation for the purpose of conversion to another type of land use, where the area to be deforested would be greater than 10 hectares of natural  woodlands or 70 hectares of conifer forest to be subject to an EIA (and developments by implication below those thresholds screened for EIA), it is my Department&rsquo;s understanding that projects involving deforestation (in addition to a felling licence) are subject to a planning permission requirement.</p>  <p>  Proponents of a project involving deforestation which believe it might be otherwise exempt of this requirement are entitled to seek a Declaration under section 5 of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act as to whether the relevant planning authority considers the proposed project does require planning permission or not.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to assess all felling licence applications and the proposals therein on the future management of their forests to ensure that licences issued are in keeping with the principles of sustainable forest management and the protection of the environment.</p></reply>

The felling and reforestation of trees is regulated by the Forestry Act 2014 and adherence to environmental standards is required. </p><p>Ireland's existing Forestry Programme has a suite of measures aimed at protecting and encouraging all sustainable harvesting activities which includes thinning, continuous cover forestry and clearfelling. </p><p>The next Forestry Programme, which is currently being prepared, will continue to provide funding to encourage increased take up of alternative harvesting systems, such as continuous cover forestry where appropriate. The species used to replant felled sites will depend on the objectives of the site and forest owner. Where commercial forestry is the objective a range of species can be planted, which includes Sitka spruce. </p><p>Although Sitka spruce is an important component of our forest estate, comprising over 51% of the area, there are a wide range of other species found. Broadleaved species account for over 28% of the national forest area. New forests planted in 2021 had over 40% of the area planted with broadleaves.</p><p>The important role of native woodlands is well recognised and my Department is acutely aware of their importance for national biodiversity.

The <i>Brexit Inshore Fisheries Business Model Adjustment Scheme</i>delivers on a recommendation of the <i>Report of the Seafood Task Force - Navigating Change</i>(October 2021).  The scheme is proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve. </p><p>As exporters of live shellfish and other highly perishable seafood products, our inshore fishers have been particularly impacted by logistical and route to market difficulties arising from Brexit.  These difficulties have added costs to the business model of our inshore fishers and in reducing the shelf life of the product have impacted negatively on prices at the quayside.  The new scheme will assist inshore fishers in adjusting their business model to the post Brexit market environment and will take the form of a suite of four online training modules to be made available by BIM, specifically tailored to the inshore fishing sector, with a payment to owners of inshore fishing vessels to assist them with the costs of undertaking the training and subsequently adjusting their business and marketing plans.  Payments will be &euro;2,700 for owners of vessels under 8 metres in length and &euro;4,000 for owners of vessels between 8 metres and 17.99 metres in length.</p><p>The scheme is based on the detailed scheme proposal to the Task Force made by the National Inshore Fisheries Forum and recommended by the Task Force for implementation.  In terms of eligibility criteria, the NIFF recommended that for vessels to be eligible, they should demonstrate that they were active during the first six months of 2021 through sales notes and logbook data and in the absence of such, through verifiable sales invoices.  In implementing this recommendation in respect of vessels under 10 metres in length, I was very conscious of the seasonal nature of their fishing activities, and as such I set an achievable threshold of &euro;1,000 in sales over that six-month period as proof of a vessel being active. </p></reply>
