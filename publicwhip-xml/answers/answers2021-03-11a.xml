With this in mind the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I am committed to helping businesses respond to the economic challenges arising from the pandemic with a particular focus on firms that do not qualify for the weekly CRSS grant from the Revenue Commissioners or existing sectoral schemes in areas such as the arts, transport and tourism.</p>  <p>  Today (11th March) I announced that applications are now open for Phase 1 of the Small Business Assistance Scheme (SBASC).  This is a new &euro;60m business assistance scheme.  The aim of this scheme is to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government&rsquo;s other existing schemes such as CRSS and is designed to help with fixed costs. Wholesalers, suppliers, caterers down 75% or more in turnover and in receipt of a rates bill may benefit, including those that commenced after the 1st November 2019 where their turnover is below projections. </p>  <p>  Businesses, will, however, be required to be in receipt of a rates bill from their local authority for their business in order to qualify.  The intention behind this provision is to assist businesses operating from fixed premises to meet some of the ongoing fixed costs of maintaining those premises.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the eligibility requirement of &euro;50,000 turnover.  It is important to remember that this scheme has been introduced to meet the unavoidable costs that businesses operating from a fixed premises incur whether they are open or not.  Analysis carried out for similar schemes has shown us that where annual turnover is less than &euro;50,000, then it is likely that most costs will be payroll based.  As you know, Government already provides subsidies or other income supports in the form of the EWSS and the PUP.  </p>  <p>  While there will undoubtedly be exceptions, it is probable that at these lower levels of turnover, the ongoing costs will generally not impact on the business&rsquo;s potential to re-open as and when restrictions ease.</p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest they contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business.</p>  <p>  Further details of the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID are available on my Department's website www.enterprise.gov.ie</p></reply>

I welcome the adoption by the Judicial Council on the 6th March of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines. The Minister for Justice intends that the new Guidelines will apply to all cases that have not yet been assessed by PIAB. This approach will ensure that the law is robust and the Guidelines can take effect as soon as possible as we seek to reduce the cost of insurance.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate the points raised in the correspondence received with this PQ, the new Guidelines clearly represent a shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded and in the level of those damages. Awards across all ranges and in all courts should be less than heretofore, with the exception of awards for the most serious types of injury and catastrophic injury. In addition, the Guidelines will apply to all cases that have not yet been assessed by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. This should facilitate an increased level of consistency in awards, more frequent early resolution of claims, and ultimately a reduction in award levels. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Capping of Personal Injury levels considered that a scheme under which general damages are capped and all awards for lesser injuries are indexed to the cap would be constitutional. However, it concluded that it would be appropriate that the Personal Injuries Guidelines be given some time to be applied in practice.  As per Action 15 of the &lsquo;Action Plan for Insurance Reform&rsquo;, Minister McEntee will make a report on the implementation and initial impact of the Guidelines by the end of 2021.  </p>  <p>  I would point out that there is no silver bullet to deal with insurance costs. That is why Government developed the &lsquo;Action Plan for Insurance Reform&rsquo; with 66 actions to drive reform across Government. While the Guidelines are important, they represent only one part of our plan. Other important actions include:</p>  <p>  - Examination of the Occupiers Liability Act 1995 to increase protections for consumers, businesses,  sporting clubs and community groups in relation to duty of care. </p>  <p>  - Reducing insurance fraud including placing perjury on a statutory footing, making the offence easier to prosecute.</p>  <p>  - Enhancing the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, for which my Department will be initiating a public consultation before the end of this month and I would welcome contributions from members.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan shows that the Government is serious about insurance reform and I am confident that through the actions outlined in the Plan we can bring about substantive change for consumers and businesses, which will make a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods.</p></reply>

With the support of our development Agencies, my Department's strategic priorities include:</p>  <p>  - Strengthening Irish enterprise to respond to market shocks and disruption in response to COVID-19 and Brexit.</p>  <p>  - Driving transformational change and the pace of innovation transitioning to new business models, digitalisation and the low carbon economy.</p>  <p>  - Scaling and growing the export and start-up base, across regions and sectors and grow companies of all sizes.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland enterprises employ over 220,000 people nationally of which 65 per cent of this employment is located outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  Scaling and growing the export and start-up base, across regions and sectors, continues to be a priority of this Government.  Through Enterprise Ireland, my Department provides assistance to entrepreneurs and start-up companies to help with business planning, mentoring and development advice, feasibility funding and finance. Programmes and initiatives include:</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s New Frontiers Development Programme, the national entrepreneur development programme for early stage start-ups. This programme runs in partnership with Institutes of Technology throughout the country.  In 2020, EI supported 157 entrepreneurs across the country on this programme.</p>  <p>  - A Competitive Start Fund to support start-up companies to reach key technical and commercial milestones. In 2020, Enterprise Ireland approved 45 new early stage businesses with investments of up to &euro;50,000 each through a series of Competitive Start Fund calls. </p>  <p>  - Support for High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) companies with the potential to develop an innovative product or service for sale in international markets and the potential to create 10 jobs and &euro;1m in sales within 3 to 4 years of starting up. In 2020, Enterprise Ireland assisted 80 HPSUs with equity investment.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided over &euro;250 million in funding to assist over 270 enterprise centres to provide the infrastructure for companies to start and scale in regions. This funding has been administered by Enterprise Ireland under schemes such as the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, the Border Enterprise Development Fund, the Community Enterprise Centres Schemes and the Campus Incubator Programme.</p>  <p>  The process to develop a series of new Regional Enterprise Plans commenced recently and will see new Plans developed for each region covering the period through to 2024.  The Plans are based on a &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; collaborative approach, involving development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, Local Enterprise Offices, Local Authorities, higher and further education bodies and businesses.  Each Regional Committee is chaired by a senior figure from industry within the region.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to ensure diversity in programme delivery which is addressing the needs and challenges of under-represented cohorts. In that regard, Enterprise Ireland has been working for over a decade to address the deficit in female entrepreneurship. This targeted focus on female entrepreneurship has resulted in an increase in the percentage of female founded High Potential Start Ups from 7 per cent in 2011, to 23.75 per cent in 2020.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 &lsquo;Action Plan for Women in Business&rsquo; seeks to build on this success to increase levels of women-led businesses and women in strategic management positions through a targeted programme.  </p></reply>

Direct s upports for the agriculture sector are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  </p>  <p>  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme, which is a policy matter for my role as Minister for Transport, stimulates demand for the use of sustainable biofuels in the transport sector. This can provide an incentive for the supply of feedstock to produce sustainable biofuels.</p>  <p>  The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat, supports the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating and other non-domestic heat users. This support, which is funded by my Department and operated by the SEAI, supports the adoption of heating systems that use solid biomass fuels and heating systems that produce and use biogas via a process called anaerobic digestion. As the uptake for this support increases in future years, it is expected to increase the demand for solid biomass fuels and feedstock to sustainably produce biogas. </p>  <p>  Biogas can also be produced via anaerobic digestion and injected into the gas grid - at which point it is described as biomethane. My Department, over the course of this year, is considering potential options that could support this activity. While I do not envisage a direct Exchequer support, the National Energy and Climate Plan sets out the potential for a renewable energy obligation to be introduced in the heat sector similar to the obligation that is already in place in the transport sector. If such an obligation were to be introduced, it could further increase the demand for feedstock to sustainably produce biogas. </p></reply>

In January 2021, the EPA and SEAI jointly published <i>'The impact on 2020 greenhouse gas emissions of COVID-19 restrictions'</i>which provides early estimates of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption for 2020. This report can be found on the SEAI and EPA websites.  </p><p>In summary, the report estimates that overall greenhouse gas emissions fell by 5.9% in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by a 17% reduction in the Transport sector and a 14% reduction in the Energy Industries sector (largely composed of the electricity generation sector), with the reduction in greenhouse gases from electricity generation driven by the reduced use of coal and peat and increased use of renewable electricity in the sector. </p><p>The report estimates that Residential sector emissions increased by 9% in 2020 largely due to an increase in working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a greenhouse gas emissions accounting perspective, residential sector emissions account for household heating needs where those needs are met using fossil fuels rather then electricity, which is accounted for in the Energy Industries sector.</p><p>The SEAI also publish monthly energy statistics bulletins on the impact of COVID-19 on energy demand trends for electricity, gas and oil, which can also be found on the SEAI website.</p><p>Next month the SEAI will publish the 2020 Provisional Energy Balance, which will provide further statistical detail on energy supply and use in 2020, including an estimate of the year-on-year change in electricity use.</p><p>Climate and energy policy is being pursued on the basis of achieving a 51% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. Temporary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in some sectors due to the Covid-19 pandemic cannot be a substitute for the necessary polices and measures required to decarbonise each sector of our economy and society.</p></reply>

Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering (including dog fouling) rests with Local Authorities. It is a matter for each Local Authority to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution locally within the legislation provided. This includes the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter and dog fouling, taking account of local circumstances and priorities.  </p>  <p>  With regard to litter awareness and education, my Department has, since 1997, co-funded the Local Authority Anti-Litter and Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme (ALAGS).  Under the scheme, local authorities are responsible for selecting suitable awareness raising and educational projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations. Where possible, the focus is on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups, and also on involving schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action. Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary/secondary school competitions, exhibitions, and the production of videos, posters and leaflets. Local authorities will continue to be encouraged, where practical under the scheme to expend a portion of their grant on dog fouling awareness projects.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-11a.59.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021031100063#WRA03700"><p>The Government&rsquo;s policy regarding the increased usage of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is primarily driven by the Climate Action Plan which sets a target of 936,000 EVs by 2030.</p>  <p>  To support these EVs, a network of 690 publicly accessible charge points is already available including circa 100 fast chargers, which are mainly found on national routes. The majority of these chargers have been rolled out by the ESB through its eCars programme, with some public chargers being provided by local authorities, retail outlets and private companies. There are currently 160 charge points and 15 fast chargers in Co Dublin. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Fund (CAF) has also allocated up to &euro;10 million to a project from ESB eCars that will further enhance its current network and complete a nationwide EV charging network capable of facilitating large-scale electric vehicle uptake over the next decade. In addition to the CAF project, the Government is also providing support for home charging and on-street charging.</p>  <p>  Home charging is considered the primary method of charging for the majority of EVs in Ireland and is a convenient, cost effective and environmentally-friendly means of charging, especially when using night-rate electricity. It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger, up to a maximum of &euro;600. </p>  <p>  Currently, work is being progressed to expand the EV Home Charger Grant to include shared parking (e.g. in apartment blocks). There are a number of complex planning issues to address before it will be possible to finalise operation of such a grant and the Department and the SEAI are working to address the issues involved. </p>  <p>  Since September 2019, the Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place to provide funding to local authorities for the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate those owners of EVs who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles on public streets to charge their EVs near their homes.  Infrastructure installed could also provide the opportunity for people visiting the area to park and charge their EVs. </p>  <p>  While several private operators such as Tesla, Ionity &amp;amp; EasyGO are involved in providing charging infrastructure, my Department does not hold information on the location of charging infrastructure which has been installed without government support.  I am aware, however, that ESB has partnered with Tesco Ireland to install 22kW Standard AC Chargers at 33 Tesco locations around the country in the last number of months. More than 50 of these are planned in total. The Department is also making &euro;2 million available this year through the SEAI to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and shopping centres. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p>  <p>  In addition, the four Dublin local authorities are currently examining their approach for a network of charging infrastructure in the metropolitan area. The Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government which will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through supports for local authority provided chargers. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government published in June last year, commits to publishing an electric vehicles infrastructure strategy. Once completed, the strategy will provide a key framework for ensuring we continue to have sufficient infrastructure in place to keep ahead of demand, while also ensuring that appropriate planning and development guidelines are followed in providing the necessary capacity. It is envisaged that the strategy will be published this year.</p></reply>

This involves identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work is being carried out in such a way so that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic law or road safety in general. </p>  <p>  Department officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation. Subject to satisfactory resolution of the necessary issues, I intend to bring forward committee stage amendments to the enabling primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is before the Oireachtas in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The current approach taken by my Department to permit the safe use of e-scooters on public roads takes into consideration the rapid development of these vehicles used for personal transportation. In order to future-proof the legislation and account for the development of these new vehicles, the road traffic acts are being amended to introduce a new category of vehicle - the proposed title for this new category is "powered personal transporters". This will be the first time the categories of vehicles set out in the Road Traffic Act 1961 have been amended.</p>  <p>  Once the new category has been defined, these vehicles are to be incorporated into the existing legislative framework (wherein a range of powers/offences already exist) and this will permit the Minister for Transport to regulate for the use/misuse and the standards for different types of powered personal transporters, for example, through the introduction of regulations for e-scooters. Furthermore, the existing offences and powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in road traffic legislation concerning careless/dangerous driving, driving under the influence of an intoxicant, driving an unroadworthy vehicle, etc., can also then be extended to users of powered personal transporters where required.</p></reply>

I note that the person referred to has already received a reply to his query from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and public transport has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the COVID-19 crisis.  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services safely during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social-distancing measures across the network.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that essential transport services, and passengers utilising these services, are protected and supported.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) continues to be guided by public health advice regarding safety measures across the public transport system and is working closely with transport operators with regard to the implementation of specific measures.</p>  <p>  The Government's "Living with Covid" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the Plan.   With the current Level 5 restrictions, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's Level 5 guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has significantly reduced the demand for public transport.  There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so. For the duration of current Level 5 restrictions, public transport services are for essential workers and essential journeys only.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most and in particular frontline workers.</p>  <p>  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice. While no significant capacity issues have been reported by operators since the move to level 5, the NTA and operators are continuing to monitor passenger loadings, and where necessary additional services will be provided if possible on certain routes at certain times of the day.</p></reply>

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licensed bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.</p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licenced public transport services that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related support.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. </p>  <p>  As is the case in many other sectors of the economy, despite these Government supports, Covid-19 has resulted in significant financial pressures for public transport operators.  As you will be aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway business operates on a commercial basis in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licenced bus market.  Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020.  This was a commercial decision by the company.  The decision affects four routes:  the Dublin/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020): and services on the Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Galway routes.  </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement public service obligation (PSO) service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfiguring to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services.</p>  <p>  I understand that Expressway ceased its X12 Limerick/Dublin route with effect from Saturday 30 January 2021.  In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X12 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X12 corridor and has determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route. </p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's questions to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

I can assure him first of all that there are no plans for the closure of any part of the rail network.  Indeed, our firm intention is to invest heavily in the quality of the network and the size of the rail fleet in order to address capacity constraints and expand services in many parts of the country. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in consultation with the Department for Infrastructure (Northern Ireland) and other relevant stakeholders, my Department is currently developing terms of reference for a Strategic Rail Review of the network on the island of Ireland.

Since 2016, transport strategies have been published in respect of the Greater Dublin Area, Galway and the Cork Metropolitan Area, with work continuing on the draft transport strategies for the Limerick-Shannon and Waterford Metropolitan areas.</p><p>This move toward evidence based, plan-led transport planning for our major cities is to be welcomed and allows for consideration of all relevant issues and the potential role all modes of transport can play in addressing those issues. I would also note that providing this type of long-term investment framework represents international best practice in the area of transport planning.</p><p>In relation to Galway, the issue of light rail in Galway city was comprehensively examined as part of the development of the <i>Galway Transport Strategy</i>. The <i>Strategy</i>concluded that a bus based public transport system, supported by various active travel and public realm improvements, represents the most appropriate system for Galway over the period considered by the Strategy. </p><p>I am eager to see progress on the delivery of the <i>Galway Transport Strategy</i>and welcome the non-statutory consultations held last year on two of the key Galway BusConnects corridors. I look forward to the delivery of much improved active travel infrastructure in the next few years as well as improvements to the commuter rail network, such as the proposals in relation to Ceannt Station, Oranmore Station and indeed the Athenry to Galway rail corridor generally. </p><p>I have met with advocates of, what is termed a &lsquo;very light rail&rsquo; system in Galway, which I understand is technology at a very early stage of development in the United Kingdom and which is not currently in operation. </p><p>I believe that its potential, or otherwise, could best be considered within the context of a review of the <i>Galway Transport Strategy</i>generally to allow for a multi-modal perspective and importantly integration within an overall land-use plan. As it is now six years since the publication of the <i>Galway Transport Strategy</i>, a review is likely warranted and I believe that such a review could commence next year. </p></reply>

For example, the interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.67% in December 2020. </p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages such as:- </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks;</p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater benefits for borrowers.  </p></reply>

In relation to new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were impacted by COVID-19 on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the issue of extending the period of a mortgage 'approval in principle', the Central Bank has advised that there are no specific regulatory requirements relating to the duration of an 'approval in principle'. That is a commercial and business matter for individual lenders.  However, the Central Bank advises that when a lender offers a mortgage to a consumer, the Consumer Protection Code provides that the lender must include the length of time for which the mortgage offer is valid in the offer document. </p>  <p>  Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the status of their mortgage application or a mortgage 'approval-in-principle' they should, in the first instance, contact their lender directly on the matter. </p>  <p>  More generally it should be noted that there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct such companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU's Solvency II framework. Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance firms as to their business activities, including requesting them to provide cover to such individuals. </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making individual-level decisions on whether to offer life insurance, including mortgage protection insurance, and what terms to apply. These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle. In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration. In the case of mortgage protection, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers use different combinations of rating factors. Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with specific firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.</p>  <p>  Having said the above, I am aware of reports of some customers experiencing issues in obtaining mortgage protection cover as a result of having higher risk conditions particular in the context of COVID-19.  The Deputy will be aware that both I and Minister of State Fleming have consistently stated that in the context of COVID-19 we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. Accordingly, the Government will continue to engage with the insurance industry in relation to how it responds to, and works to protect its customers needs. This commitment is included in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  My officials recently contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for such providers, on the issue of mortgage protection insurance. It stated that while most customers are still able to get life; critical illness; or mortgage protection insurance at this challenging time it is aware of a small number of individual cases where a final decision on some applications is being postponed for a period where applicants have a COVID-19-related health condition. However, it stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions are taken into account by the underwriters, as was the case pre-COVID-19. Insurance Ireland has also said that it understands that mortgage protection is not a universal requirement by banks, and that there are waiver conditions set out in the Consumer Credit Act where the lender may be able to proceed without the protection cover in place for mortgages in certain situations and this is at the lender&rsquo;s discretion.</p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day operations of any bank operating within the State including banks in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. </p>  <p>  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. </p>  <p>  This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in the main it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs, it is important to note that banks cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason the approach taken is to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.</p></reply>

The arrangements for allowing tax relief on such donations by individuals vary depending on whether the donor is a self-assessed or a PAYE-only taxpayer.  </p>  <p>  - An individual who is a self-assessed taxpayer makes the donation to the approved sports body and claims tax relief on the donation by way of a deduction from her/his income on her/his annual income tax return.</p>  <p>  - For donations made by PAYE-only taxpayers, relief is given on a &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; basis to the approved sports body.  In other words, the donation is treated as having been received by the approved body net of income tax at the donor&rsquo;s marginal rate.  This is similar to the  way in which donations to approved (charitable) bodies under s. 848B of the TCA were treated at the time of the introduction of s. 847A TCA in 2002. </p>  <p>  This approach now differs from the current tax treatment of donors under s. 848B TCA to approved (charitable) bodies. The provisions for tax relief for donations made by individuals to charities under s. 848B were changed in Finance Act 2012, with a view to simplifying the regime of tax relief for donations.  This followed the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation 2009 and a working group, chaired by my Department, which included representatives of the charities sector, and subsequent to a public consultation process.  Since 1 January 2013, tax relief under section 848A TCA in respect of donations made by individuals (whether self-assessed or PAYE-only taxpayers) under the Charitable Donation Scheme (CDS) is given to the body rather than to the donor.  A donation which satisfies the conditions of section 848A is grossed up at the &ldquo;specified rate&rdquo; (currently 31%).  The tax treatment of donations by individuals to approved sporting bodies was not within the scope of that working group or consultation and has not been changed. </p>  <p>  I have no plans at the present time to change the tax treatment of the various classes of tax-payer under s. 847A TCA.  However, tax expenditure measures are kept under regular review by my Department as part of its on-going programme of work.  Proposals for change are dealt with in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

Limiting the exemptions available allows the LPT rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption. There is no specific exemption from the requirement to pay LPT for pensioners in receipt of fuel allowance under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), though such persons may be entitled to an exemption on other grounds or may qualify for a deferral subject to meeting the qualifying conditions.  </p><p>The LPT legislation provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and the person meets certain criteria based on income thresholds.  The property must be the sole or main residence of the liable person and his or her gross income must be below certain thresholds.  The thresholds are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a married couple, civil partners or cohabiting couple.  Deferral in respect of half of the local property tax payable is possible, where the gross income is above the threshold but less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple. Further information regarding the deferral of LPT is available on the Revenue website at link <i>www.revenue.ie/en/property/documents/lpt/guidelines-for-deferral-of-lpt.pdf</i>.</p><p>Any property owners experiencing financial difficulties can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options in respect of 2021 liabilities and for any previous years where liabilities remain outstanding and can be assured that Revenue will take account of their current circumstances in agreeing payment arrangements.

This involved actions across the whole of Government, including supports to businesses to diversify trade beyond the UK market. </p>  <p>  More recently, to prepare our economy for the immediate impacts of Brexit, the Government in Budget 2021 allocated unprecedented resources to confronting the twin challenges of COVID-19 and Brexit, with &euro;340 million to be spent on Brexit-related measures. When these measures are taken into account, Brexit related expenditure to date is over &euro;1 billion. </p>  <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s proposal to allocate &euro;1 billion from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve to Ireland is welcome. The very significant share of the fund initially allocated to Ireland reflects the research undertaken by my Department which shows the disproportionate impact of Brexit on Ireland.  The Fund will be used to support the most affected sectors of our economy. Discussions are taking place within Government Departments as to how best to allocate Ireland&rsquo;s share of the Brexit Adjustment Fund.</p>  <p>  The Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and UK was a positive conclusion to the transition period. However, the new agreement still represents a break from the previously existing arrangements and it does not completely mitigate against &lsquo;trade frictions&rsquo; in the form of non-tariff barriers. Further import controls will be introduced by the UK on 1 April on certain categories of EU goods, including plant and animal products.  A range of Government support is available to Irish exporters, including training and grants, to help businesses deal with these changes. It is vital that business prepare for this next stage.</p>  <p>  The successful negotiation of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland, as part of the Withdrawal Agreement, delivered key economic objectives for Ireland. The Protocol secures Ireland&rsquo;s place within the Single Market, avoids a hard border on the island, protects the all-island economy, and provides Northern Ireland with unique access to both the British internal market and the EU single market. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government remains focused on protecting our economic and financial interests, and will continue to work to minimise the disruption that Brexit will have on the economy and peoples&rsquo; livelihoods to the greatest extent possible. </p></reply>

Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: <i></i>.  </p><p>To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its business premises.  </p><p>To make a claim under the CRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made.</p><p>A qualifying business may make a claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment known as an &ldquo;Advance Credit for Trading Expenses&rdquo;. This payment will be equal to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in 2020 in the case of a new business) up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000, for each week that the business is affected by the Covid restrictions. </p><p>As of 4 March 2021, payments of &euro;351 million have been made in respect of 22,900 premises. </p><p>The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. As of 4 March, subsidy payments of over &euro;2.2 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;378m granted to over 47,600 employers in respect of over 537,100 employees.</p><p>I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to supports and, as Deputies will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 23 February, it has been decided that both the EWSS and the CRSS are now to be extended until the end of June 2021. </p><p>With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.  It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of the second quarter of 2021.</p><p>As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). </p><p>Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p><p>The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

It is vital that the Irish public have a readily available, reliable source of information on Covid-19 and the measures being put in place to tackle the crisis. </p>  <p>  Equally as important are the sources of funding that make it possible for public service broadcasting to operate.  At a time when advertising revenues are falling, the Covid-19 crisis is putting considerable strain on the resources of all broadcasters. Licence fee receipts are therefore essential to maintaining the service provided by RT&Eacute;. The Sound and Vision Fund is also financed from the TV licence fee which provided funding for a special Covid-19 round of &euro;2.5m for commercial radio in 2020.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) also ran a special round under Sound and Vision for community radio of &euro;750,000. Similar rounds are being run in 2021 to support the independent production sector and maintain jobs in the industry.</p>  <p>  Given the importance of these services at the present time, it is not my intention to introduce waivers on TV licence payments on holiday homes.</p></reply>

The aim of the workshop is to provide adults with the knowledge and confidence to promote and support young people&rsquo;s mental health in their coaching role.</p>  <p>  To date, Jigsaw has delivered 120 One Good Coach workshops to a wide breadth of coaches in communities across Ireland. Given the success of the workshop in communities, One Good Coach was converted to an online workshop in 2018 to reach a wider national audience. Jigsaw partnered with the GAA&rsquo;s Healthy Club Project to pilot the online workshop in 2019 and to date over 300 GAA coaches have completed the workshop.</p>  <p>  One Good Coach is currently being rolled out with a range of sporting bodies, including the IRFU, Swim Ireland, Basketball Ireland and the FAI, reaching thousands of coaches across the country </p>  <p>  A small group of registered coaches from Swim Ireland and the IRFU have been invited to take part in the research study. The study assesses whether the online workshop increases participants' understanding of mental health promotion and their confidence and intention to engage in mental health promoting behaviours with the young athletes they coach, as needed. Participants in the study are required to complete a short online questionnaire before they begin the workshop, one week after completing the workshop, and again twelve weeks later. Alongside this, a subset of participants are also invited to take part in a follow-up interview to gather further information as to the acceptability of the workshop to coaches.</p>  <p>The research study is underway with both National Governing Bodies until the end of March. To date, a number of coaches from both organisations have agreed to take part in the study and have completed the online questionnaires. As of 3rd March 2021, 30 coaches have completed the first two stages, i.e., at the beginning of the workshop and one week after completion. </p>  <p>  Coaches are being invited to take part in follow-up interviews in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Government's response to the impact of the pandemic on the sector and the economy generally is comprised of a broad range of supports delivered across a range of Departments.  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme  and the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme form the principle elements of the Government's response.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently announced the COVID-19 Business Aid Scheme (CBAS) as a further horizontal support across all sectors of the economy.  SMEs and Businesses in the non-funded live entertainment sector are eligible to apply under this scheme.  </p><p>This week I was pleased to announce a new &euro;50 million suite of additional measures to further support those in the Live Entertainment Sector. As part of this suite, an allocation of &euro;25 million is being made available under the Live Performance Support Scheme 2021.  This scheme builds on the successful outcomes of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences.  </p><p>The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department. The Live Performance Support Scheme 2021 will be open for applications on 19<sup></sup>March 2021 and further information can be found on my Department's website. </p><p>An allocation of &euro;5 million has be made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events.  Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances.  </p><p>As a further support measure for those in the live entertainment industry, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for a new scheme to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments:</p><p>- &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p><p>- &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000. </p><p>Under the scheme, musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers -  whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply. The scheme will open when the necessary administrative and IT systems are in place.</p><p>&euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector. This will be applied to supporting the installation of high quality recording and streaming facilities in venues through a competitive grant application process. </p><p>Additionally, up to &euro;1 million has been allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming to support the employment of performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021 has curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations that will be broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel over six days and nights, marking the national day. </p><p>My Department has no specific responsibility for the public relations, marketing or communications sectors.Further information on the business and financial supports my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has in place to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis can be viewed at the following link <i></i>. </p></reply>

The current epidemiological situation is such that it does not permit Government consideration at this time of the resumption of sporting activity by sports groups. The Government's clear message at the present time is for people to stay in their homes, unless necessary for those essential reasons set out in the public health regulations.</p><p>In the context of the recent publication of the <i>COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021 &ndash; The Path Ahead, </i>the Government has<i></i>agreed that the public health restrictions will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The public health advice is that it is too early to say how and when other restrictions should be eased given current uncertainties. Government will meet in advance of the 5th of April to review the level of restrictions. The focus of the assessment, based on the public health advice, will be on achieving the following before any significant easing of measures is contemplated:</p><p>1. Disease prevalence (case numbers/incidence) is brought to much lower levels that can be managed and controlled by public health and that the reproduction number (&ldquo;R&rdquo; number) is such that we can be confident that we can continue to suppress the disease e.g., at or below 1.</p><p>2. Hospital and critical care occupancy are reduced to low levels to protect the health service and allow for the safe resumption of non-COVID-19 care.</p><p>3. Ongoing and steady progress on the vaccination programme such that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination.</p><p>4. Emerging information on variants of concern.</p><p>Any easing of measures should be slow and gradual with sufficient time between phases to assess impact and to respond if the epidemiological situation was to deteriorate. It will take account of emerging international and national evidence and experience and with a specific focus on supporting mental health and wellbeing. The Government has agreed that the following areas may be considered if the situation improves sufficiently:</p><p>- Some easing of restrictions on outdoor activities and meetings beyond 1 other household.</p><p>- Consideration of extending the current 5km limit.</p><p>- Staggered start of easing of other areas of activity with a focus on outdoor activities including sport and some areas of construction.</p><p>Minister Martin and I will continue our engagement with Sport Ireland and the sporting bodies with a view to bringing proposals at the appropriate time for consideration by Government, in consultation with NPHET and the public health authorities. </p></reply>

My Department has been engaging with the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) in relation to the registration of Architectural Technologists.  In this regard, CIAT has identified that its preferred route is to set up a stand-alone register for Architectural Technologists. As such, it is now a matter for CIAT to set up a register on an administrative basis in keeping with registers already in place for other professional groupings under the Building Control Act 2007 and in consultation with the relevant industry stakeholders.  CIAT have been advised that the register should be in place for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate that it operates effectively in accordance with the provisions of the act.</p>  <p>  Following this process, my Department will review the register and subject to this review, will then consider bringing forward legislative proposals to place it on a statutory basis.  CIAT have been advised of the process required to publish primary legislation.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that, depending on their personal background and experience, it may be open to persons who are Architectural Technologists, and who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers in respect of Architects or Building Surveyors. A number of Architectural Technologists have already succeeded in gaining inclusion on the statutory registers to date and are thus in a position to act as Design Certifiers and Assigned Certifiers.</p></reply>

My Department operates a number of funding programmes that assist local authorities to work in partnership with AHBs to construct, purchase and lease new homes and make them available for social housing. One such programme that AHBs progress construction projects through is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF)</p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.<b></b>Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from my Department. </p><p>There is a housing project comprising 40 high-quality homes for social housing use, that is being progressed by the AHB, Cluid Housing, in the location referred to, working in partnership with Dublin City Council. I can confirm that my Department issued a CALF approval for this Turnkey project in January 2021. This project is nearing completion and has an indicative completion date April 2021. As with all turnkey construction projects in the current COVID 19 climate, delivery programmes and timelines are under constant review.</p><p>My Department publishes a quarterly Social Housing Construction Projects Status Report, which sets out the continuing progress being made in advancing the national local authority and AHB new-build pipeline.

The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 extended the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and of the RTB to cover student licences in student-specific accommodation.  Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, or my Department to comment on or intervene in the specifics of any individual case.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 provide for minimum notice periods to be served by tenants and landlords for tenancy terminations &ndash; for example, a student must provide 28 days' notice to end a tenancy of less than 6 months duration or 35 days to end a tenancy of more than 6 months but less than 1 year. The Acts do not prescribe specific terms and conditions regarding the payment of rents or deposits for inclusion in individual letting agreements in the private rental market including the student-specific accommodation sector. Contract law governs such arrangements. The specific terms associated with an individual student&rsquo;s rights and obligations are likely to be set out in a written contract signed by both the student and the landlord. </p><p>Students may wish to contact their third level education providers to seek any assistance that they might be in a position to provide to resolve any issues arising. If a student cannot come to an agreement with their accommodation provider, they might wish to contact the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) regarding their concerns &ndash; <i></i>- or to refer a dispute for resolution with regard to the non-refund of their deposit.</p><p>I understand that the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is working with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students during this difficult time. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science understands, based on the information available to it, that the majority of students in university-owned accommodation received pro-rata refunds on foot of vacating their accommodation on foot of Covid-19.  </p><p>While I also wish to see this principle applied in the case of students who were residing in privately owned student accommodation, it is not within the remit of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science nor of my Department to direct any accommodation provider to refund rents paid.</p><p>On 25 February 2021, the Opposition introduced the Residential Tenancies (Student Rents and Other Protections) (Covid-19) Bill 2021.

The URDF is one of four funds established under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has responsibility for its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Fund is providing part-funding for applicant led projects that will enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and large towns, while also ensuring that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit. </p>  <p>  The URDF, as a key activator of the National Planning Framework (NPF) and Project Ireland 2040, is supporting a programme of significant transformational capital projects that will contribute to the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the NPF and PI2040. </p>  <p>  All applications for URDF support are assessed in terms of their alignment with the intended purpose of the URDF programme and also their viability before being considered for approval.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the approved proposal in question, Dublin City Council&rsquo;s North Inner City Concept Area 1, the recently announced global provisional allocation of &euro;121,285,388 for this multi-element project is a new allocation under Call 2 of the URDF which will be funded from an allocation of &euro;2 billion provided under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2018-2027.</p>  <p>  In the coming weeks my Department will issue a formal approval in principle letter in respect of this successful proposal to Dublin City Council, which will set out the arrangements and conditions attached to URDF support, and which will also provide a breakdown of the global provisional allocation by sub-project.  </p>  <p>  While my Department works closely with the successful applicants in respect of project funding, responsibility for the advancement of URDF supported projects through the various stages of planning, development and completion is, in the first instance, a matter for the Sponsoring Agency, in this case Dublin City Council.  </p>  <p>  In this regard it should be noted that all URDF supported projects must be carefully developed and managed by the Sponsoring Agency in accordance with the normal conditions and arrangements that apply to public sector managed projects including, exercising appropriate cost control and delivering projects as approved, and in full compliance with the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

Development education contributes to an active Irish public, engaged and well-informed on issues which impact on global dynamics with an emphasis on understanding inequalities and interdependencies, including raising awareness of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. </p>  <p>My Department&rsquo;s current approach is governed by the Irish Aid Development Education Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2023.  This year, the Irish Aid budget for development education is &euro;5.29 million, which is available to both formal and non-formal education sectors, including schools and schools networks, third level institutions, non-governmental organisations, youth, adult and community groups. Organisations funded are typically members of the Irish Development Education Association, which has produced a Code of Good Practice for Development Education available on its website, www.ideaonline.ie.</p>  <p>  Recognising the changes in the general education environment over the past year due to the pandemic, in particular the move to digital education, I decided that it would be appropriate to revisit the current Irish Aid Development Education Strategy.  On 15 February, I launched a consultation process for a new strategy, which would address development education and global citizenship.  That consultation is ongoing, with a view to identify new opportunities for engagement, looking to see how lifelong learning concepts might be most effectively integrated into our approaches and, importantly, how we engage with new audiences around the country.</p>  <p>  The new strategy will build on strong foundations.  In 2019-2020, Irish Aid supported 31 partners to deliver development education projects, reaching more than 350,000 people.  This includes 70% of second-level schools. 23 of the 26 Higher Education Institutes are providing Irish Aid supported global citizenship courses and other initiatives. In addition, the Department provided grant funding to NGOs and other groups for activities to promote understanding of an engagement with global issues. </p>  <p>  The Development Assistance Committee of the OECD reviewed the Irish Aid programme last year, finding Ireland to have a strong approach to development education, focusing on achieving greater knowledge and changed attitudes. The review states that Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;approach encompasses both formal and non-formal education and relies on strong partnerships among the government, non-governmental organisations, education actors and local communities. Outreach to schools is already very substantial, and Ireland is aiming to reach wider audiences to sustain and deepen the considerable support within the Irish population.&rdquo;</p></reply>

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020/2021 academic year. </p><p>The Department of Education has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including a Private College provider), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021. </p><p>These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020. It will also ensure that any final year students have the opportunity to graduate as scheduled in summer 2021.  </p><p>Budget 2020 provided for the re-instatement of the grant to cover the full cost of the Gaeltacht Learning Periods (GLPs) for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary ITE programmes, with effect from the 2020/2021 academic year.  The grant was previously funded by the Department of Education up to the 2012/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints.  The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650.  This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements. </p><p>In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of <i>Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge</i>which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. </p><p>It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme.  HEIs are currently working directly with their Gaeltacht College providers on implementing the practical and administrative arrangements for delivery of the GLP. </p><p>An allowance has been made for 2<sup>nd</sup>year Professional Masters in Education (PME) students (including students in the College referred to by the Deputy). Those 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have not completed any GLP will now complete a 3 week online programme (had previously been required to complete 4 weeks). 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have completed some of their required GLP will now be required to complete the remaining balance (up to a total requirement of 3 weeks) online. This particular allowance, approved by the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Education Committee, recognised the significant timetabling issues facing 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students in respect of school placement, the GLP and normal course work. </p><p>In relation to the cost of the online programme for students of the private college provider, the Department of Education has recently responded to a proposal from that College confirming that both the Department and the Teaching Council has no issue with that College, working in collaboration with a Gaeltacht College(s) to provide an online programme based on the agreed syllabus for their own students and to negotiate and set the cost for undertaking that programme for their own students. </p><p>The Department understands that the private College has now organised the provision of an online GLP programme for all of their students in collaboration with one Gaeltacht College. </p></reply>

My Department is not directly involved in these decisions.</p>  <p>  As outlined in Circular 0038/2007, eligible pupils may spend up to two years in SSLD classes.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently developing Policy Advice on Special Classes and Special Schools, which is now due to be completed by year end.

In the current school year over 113,100 children, including over 14,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only.  Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment, on time, of the annual charge. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year, is not available on public scheduled services and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education cycle. </p>  <p>  Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann will determine the allocation of the tickets.  Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that the children to whom the Deputy refers are not eligible for school transport as they are not attending their nearest post primary school. They were unsuccessful in obtaining a concessionary ticket for the 2020/21 school year.  At this stage Bus &Eacute;ireann cannot confirm if this family will be successful in obtaining concessionary tickets for the 2021/2022 school year as the availability of concessionary transport varies from year to year.</p></reply>

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>The NCSE does not hold records relating to applications received by schools from parents of children in primary special schools transitioning to post primary. Enrolments to individual schools are a matter for each board of management. It should also be noted that the majority of special schools cater for students up to the age of 18.</p><p>However, the NCSE, through its local network of SENOs (Special Educational Needs Organiser), offers advice and support to parents of students that are due to transition to post primary school on the possible placement options available to their child, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement and special school placement.</p><p>All post primary placements are supported with additional resources where required for those students with special educational needs.</p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.  A network of 29 special classes operate in Cork City currently to provide students with places where complex needs are identified in professional reports and are accompanied by a recommendation for a special class placement.  </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. The NCSE provides a programme of teacher professional learning and in-school support to support schools in establishing special classes.</p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.  For September 2021, the NCSE is aware of a specific identified need for special school placements in Cork City and County and is working with my Department and the education partners towards meeting that need.  </p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. </p><p>NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements. </p><p>The NCSE's local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: .  </p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes is available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The current COVID-19 arrangements in place for teachers are outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0049/2020.  </p><p>The HSE has recently published guidance for the education sector in respect of pregnant employees and my Department is currently seeking clarifications from the HSE on this guidance. In the meantime, a pregnant teacher should temporarily continue to work remotely i.e. working from home. </p><p>The temporary arrangements for teachers during the partial re-opening period are outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Information Note TC 0005/2021 for primary teachers and Information Note TC 0007/2021 for post primary teachers.  On the full re-opening of primary schools due to take place on 15<sup>th</sup>March, Information Note TC 0010/2021 for primary teachers SNAs will apply. </p><p>My Department has an enhanced Occupational Health Service (OHS) in place, to provide employers with occupational health advice in relation to teacher&rsquo;s fitness for work.  The current OHS provider has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about their risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, through workplace attendance. </p><p>A detailed on-line questionnaire is submitted by the teacher to the OHS, along with detailed medical evidence to provide clarity with respect to the medical complaint(s) in question.  All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when a teacher suffers from more than one health condition.  The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  A teacher is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are &lsquo;Normal Risk&rsquo;, High Risk&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo;. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the latest HSE guidance.My Department is following the same guidance that is in use across the public sector.  The latest HSE guidance on the &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; group is at: <i></i>.  </p><p>Where a teacher considers the OHS &quot;Covid-19 Health Risk Categorisation report&quot; places him/her in an incorrect risk category, he/she may request review. The teacher may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. </p><p>Based on HSE advice, a teacher categorised by the OHS as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; must not attend the workplace.  However he/she remains available for work and the employer should prioritise alternative working arrangements to the maximum extent possible e.g. working from home.  </p><p>The employer has a responsibility to assess the school environment using the COVID-19 Response Plan for the school, to ensure that all the appropriate HSE recommendations for safe school operations during Covid-19 are being implemented in full.  </p><p>During the current period of partial re-opening of primary and post primary schools, an employer should temporarily facilitate more flexible working arrangements where a teacher has been categorised by the OHS as &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo;. A teacher who is over 60 years of age should also be temporarily facilitated by these arrangements. This may include re-assignment of a teacher to other duties within the school or facilitated to work remotely i.e. working from home.  When schools fully re-open, these flexible working arrangements will no longer be available and therefore a teacher in the &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; group who is medically fit for work must return to the workplace.</p></reply>

These schools are staffed on the basis of individual pupil profile and the disability categorisations of those pupils, as opposed to being based primarily on school designation, in accordance with my Department's Circular 0032/2019 - Appointment of Administrative Deputy Principal and Staffing in Special Schools.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides an extensive range of supports for pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD).  This includes provision for the establishment of special classes for pupils with SSLD in primary schools. A total of 63 SSLD special classes in mainstream primary schools have been provided for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including applications to establish special classes for SSLD.  Applications meeting the criteria for establishment are approved by the NCSE.  </p>  <p>  The opening and retention of SSLD special classes is, however, contingent on the Health Service Executive (HSE) being in a position to provide speech and language therapy to the students in the class.  The availability and provision of speech and language therapy is the responsibility of the HSE. </p>  <p>  The enrolment of pupils in SSLD special classes is managed locally by an Admissions &amp;amp; Discharges Committee, comprising the Speech and Language Therapy Manager, Speech and Language Therapist, Class Teacher and Principal.   </p>  <p>  As outlined in Circular 0038/2007, eligible pupils may spend up to two years in SSLD classes. </p>  <p>  Students who are not enrolled in a special class for SSLD and who meet the SSLD criteria, as outlined in Circular 0038/2007, may qualify for additional Special Education Teaching (SET) support; as may students with mild speech and language difficulties. The school referred to by the Deputy has an allocation of 136 SET hours per week. It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such students. My Department is not directly involved in these decisions.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently developing Policy Advice on Special Classes and Special Schools. My Department, in conjunction with the NCSE is also considering the existing definition of Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD).   </p>  <p>  There will be no change to the criteria for enrolment in special classes for pupils with speech and language difficulties, pending the outcome of these considerations and the finalisation of the Policy Advice.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p><p>The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2021 is expected to exceed &euro;1.4 billion.  </p><p>At the end of January, there were 89,092 recipients of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure for the payment in 2021 is in the region of &euro;953 million. </p><p>The means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system.  Currently, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.</p><p>By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;120 per week (which will increase to &euro;140 per week from June 2021).  For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p><p>The ESRI SWITCH microsimulation model has been used for the purposes of the estimate requested.  The additional cost of increasing the means test threshold for entitlement to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance for single and couple cohabiting applicants separately in &euro;50 intervals, up to &euro;450 for single applicants and &euro;950 for couple cohabiting applicants per week are set out in tabular form below.  The final interval in each case is less than &euro;50 in order to arrive at the upper limits of &euro;450 and &euro;950 requested by the Deputy.  It should be noted that the additional estimated costs provided are based on existing recipient data contained in the model.  </p><p>It is not possible to give the estimated increase in the number of persons entitled to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if the means test thresholds were increased.  This is primarily because it is not known how many people there are caring and working that are currently over the income limit but who could apply for/become eligible for Carer's Allowance if the income limits were higher. Furthermore, SWITCH cannot model behavioural responses in such cases.  </p><p>Based on the Department's own analysis of the Carer's Allowance, it should be noted that some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.  Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households.  </p><p>Any changes to the means test must be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Table 1: Carer's Allowance Single Person Disregard Increase from &euro;332.50 to &euro;450.00 in increments of &euro;50.00</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Single Person Disregard</th>       <th>Increase</th>       <th>Cumulative Increase from Existing Disregard</th>       <th>Estimated Additional Cost (&euro;M) from the current disregard</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;382.50</td>       <td>&euro;50.00</td>       <td>&euro;50.00</td>       <td>&euro;2.33</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;432.50</td>       <td>&euro;50.00</td>       <td>&euro;100.00</td>       <td>&euro;3.26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;450.00</td>       <td>&euro;17.50</td>       <td>&euro;117.50</td>       <td>&euro;3.26</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2: Carer's Allowance Couples Disregard Increase from &euro;665.00 to &euro;950.00 in increments of &euro;50.00</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Couples Disregard</th>       <th>Increase </th>       <th>Cumulative Increase from Existing Disregard</th>       <th>Estimated Additional Cost (&euro;M) from the current disregard</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;715.00</td>       <td>&euro;50.00</td>       <td>&euro;50.00</td>       <td>&euro;1.50</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;765.00</td>       <td>&euro;50.00</td>       <td>&euro;100.00</td>       <td>&euro;2.33</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;815.00</td>       <td>&euro;50.00</td>       <td>&euro;150.00</td>       <td>&euro;2.94</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;865.00</td>       <td>&euro;50.00</td>       <td>&euro;200.00</td>       <td>&euro;3.26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;915.00</td>       <td>&euro;50.00</td>       <td>&euro;250.00</td>       <td>&euro;3.26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;950.00</td>       <td>&euro;35.00</td>       <td>&euro;285.00</td>       <td>&euro;3.81</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;195 million in 2021.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and/or Allowance, carers receive further support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  In Budget 2021 I was delighted to announce an increase to the Carers Support Grant by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850.  This will benefit over 130,000 carers.  Carers in receipt of an increase for a qualified child on their claim will also benefit from the Budget 2021 announced increase to the qualified child rate, by &euro;5 in the case of a child aged 12 or over and by &euro;2 for a child aged up to 12.</p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a Carer will very often live with and be caring for a person in receipt of a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  Income from full rate Carer's Allowance is disregarded from the fuel means test if the carer is providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant, his/her qualified spouse / civil partner or cohabitant or qualified child(ren). </p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, s/he can keep his/her main social protection payment in addition to receiving the half-rate Carer's Allowance.  S/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s/he cares for more than one person.  It should also be noted that the payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then s/he is deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then s/he will have to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my Department.  </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. </p>  <p>  Carers can also engage in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for not more than 18.5 hours a week.</p>  <p>  Any decision to amend the criteria for receiving Fuel Allowance, to include Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as a qualifying payment, would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment is a contribution towards heating costs. It is not intended to meet these costs in full.  The payment is made at the weekly rate of &euro;28.00; or if preferred, by way of two lump sum payments; and is paid over the winter season (28 weeks in the 2020/2021 fuel allowance season).  Only one Fuel Allowance is payable per household.  </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have agreed an arrangement with my Department whereby deductions in respect of Local Property Tax (LPT) may be made from nine long term, stable social welfare scheme payments.  This is a voluntary arrangement directly between the customer and the Revenue Commissioners, with the deductions facilitated by my Department at the request of the customer.  </p>  <p>  My Department has an obligation to safeguard customer payments and to ensure that deductions in respect of LPT do not cause undue financial hardship to the customer.  Accordingly, deductions are not taken from a customer&rsquo;s payment where this would reduce their weekly personal rate below the Supplementary Welfare Allowance personal rate, which is currently set at &euro;201.00 per week. </p>  <p>  As at the end of February 2021, there are 131,433 state pension (contributory and non-contributory) recipients in receipt of Fuel Allowance.  Of these, 7,453 have chosen to pay their Local Property Tax by way of deduction from their state pension (contributory/non-contributory) payment.  </p>  <p>  It is only possible to estimate the average rate of weekly voluntary LPT deduction from state (contributory and non-contributory) pension payments of those who also receive Fuel Allowance.

It laid down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection and has brought us into line with the norms and standards for reception conditions for international protection applicants across the EU.  i consider that Ireland is in compliance with these Regulations.</p>  <p>  The Regulations include responsibilities for a number of Government Departments and agencies including my own Department.  </p>  <p>  When the transfer of functions took place between my Department and the Department of Justice on 14 October 2020, the Regulations pertaining to the provision of material reception conditions, which include housing, food, clothing and a daily expenses allowance, came under my remit.</p>  <p>  The National Standards for accommodation offered to people in the protection process were published on 15 August 2019 and are fully compliant with the Directive.  The Standards address a range of themes including accommodation; food and catering; individual, community and family life; health and wellbeing; governance; and meeting the special reception needs of applicants. The National Standards provide a framework for the continual development of person-centred, high-quality, safe and effective services and supports for residents living in accommodation centres. The purpose of the National Standards is to improve quality of care and ensure consistency across accommodation centres. The National Standards also provide residents with a guide as to what they should expect during their period of residence in an accommodation centre.  The Standards are applicable as of 1 January 2021.</p>  <p>  A new Vulnerability Assessment process is currently being piloted by the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department.  The pilot commenced in December 2020 and was extended to all new applicants for international protection from the beginning of February.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these assessments is to determine if, by virtue of a particular category of vulnerability, an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, what those needs are and what actions are required to address those needs. </p>  <p>  Assessment questions are based on the various categories of vulnerability identified within the EU Reception Conditions Directive 2013/33/EU, and have been refined within the Irish context with the help of the HSE. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have now published the White Paper White Paper to End Direct Provision and to establish a new International Protection Support Service. The White Paper sets out a new Government policy to establish a new International Protection Support Service which I envision will be fully operational by December 2024.  </p></reply>

The approach taken involved a clear and deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who resided in Mother and Baby Homes over the period.</p>  <p>  In examining the exit pathways of children, Article 1(VII) of the terms of reference tasked the Commission with examining the nature of the relationship between Mother and Baby Homes and other key institutions &ndash; these included children&rsquo;s homes; orphanages; and adoption societies. This involved the identification of patterns of referral and the practices and arrangements for the placement of children. It also included where an intermediary organisation was involved in arranging a subsequent placement.  </p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s final Report addresses important questions in relation to the practices for the placement of children that were in place during the period under investigation. The Commission was able to cross-reference information from the institutional records, State records, testimony from witnesses and evidence from other sources.</p>  <p>  For this reason, it is not accurate to suggest that the experiences of persons who were boarded were excluded from the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters). This is evident in the 77 pages of detailed analysis on related matters in Chapter 11 - Boarded Out Children of the Commission's Final Report. </p>  <p>  The process of developing the detailed terms of reference for the Commission was led by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and supported by a high level Inter-Departmental Group on Mother and Baby Homes. </p>  <p>  Following a motion approved by Dail Eireann on 11 June 2014, which committed to the establishment of a Commission of Investigation, the then Minister engaged in a comprehensive scoping process to define the appropriate scope and format for this investigation. The Minister was assisted by an Inter-Departmental Group established with the task of gathering relevant information and reporting to Government on the means by which these complex matters could be investigated. </p>  <p>  The role of the Inter-Departmental Group was to inform the Government's deliberations on the scope, format and terms of reference of the Commission of Investigation.  The Group comprised of representatives from eight Departments and the Attorney General's Office and was chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The process drew upon a number of cited secondary sources, in particular a number of published social histories, to complement information from records held by the Department of Health and the General Registrar&rsquo;s Office.</p>  <p>  The Group's Report was published in July 2014 and is available on my Department's website.  This initial examination served to highlight the complexity of the issue and the volume of records that were potentially relevant to the work of the Commission.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs also had regard to his consultations with opposition parties, key stakeholders and the response to the call for submissions on the Terms of Reference, all of which informed the Government&rsquo;s considerations. I understand that over one hundred submissions were received.  </p>  <p>  The scope of the investigation, including the Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference, were decided by Government on the advice of the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

The number of confirmed cases from those files has now increased to 151.</p>  <p>  While there have been suspicions about the practice of illegal or incorrect registrations for many years, and indeed the Department was informed of such suspicions, it is very difficult to confirm cases of illegal birth registrations. This is due to a number of factors including the historic nature of the cases, and the fact that, as falsely registering a birth is and always has been an offence, it is very unlikely that records will be kept of the practice.</p>  <p>  The State has a responsibility to reach a high level of certainty before it determines that births have been illegally registered and proceeds to contact the individuals concerned. The cases uncovered in the St Patricks Guild files were confirmed once a rigorous process was completed to ensure that the State could be as confident as possible that these individuals' births were in fact illegally registered. To the Department's knowledge, the cases announced in May 2018 represent the first time the required threshold of a high level of certainty was reached on the basis of the information on the files, and in particular the existence of a marker "adopted from birth&rdquo;. There is no guarantee that the same level of evidence is to be found in relation to other historic adoption records, that would allow a suspicion to be confirmed as an illegal birth registration. </p>  <p>  Following the discovery of evidence of illegal birth registration in the St. Patrick Guild files, an independent review was commissioned in 2018 to investigate whether there are markers to indicate a practice of illegal birth registration in the records of other adoption agencies and similar institutions.  The publication of this review, which took place yesterday, had to await the final report of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission, as it encroached on the work of that Commission. A copy of that report is available on my Department's website. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to investigate the provision of paid leave and social protection provision to victims of domestic violence with a view to establishing a statutory entitlement to paid domestic violence leave. My Department is currently examining the feasibility of introducing such proposals and has committed to developing a report to Government within six months, with legislative proposals to follow within 4 months. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the development of a scheme of domestic violence leave is currently being scoped by officials in my Department, which will include the examination of domestic violence leave at international level, the identification of best practice and the development of a suitable model for rollout in Ireland.  This work will inform policy development and proposals in this area. However, as it is being undertaken by my officials, it was not deemed to fall under the list of live studies, reviews and research undertaken or commissioned. </p><p>My Department is engaging in a broader consultation process with relevant stakeholders and social partners to examine how a scheme of paid leave should operate to address the needs of victims most effectively. At my Department&rsquo;s request, the Department of Justice convened a special meeting of the monitoring committee of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence on 16 February 2021 to explore this issue with service providers and victims&rsquo; representative groups. A number of consultations have been conducted with employers groups and trade unions, with further consultations planned with stakeholders of the national Equality Strategy Committees falling under my Department&rsquo;s remit. Written submissions have been invited from relevant stakeholders, which will identify key issues arising for both employees and employers, and inform future policy development in this area.</p><p>The table below contains details of stakeholder consultations conducted to date: <table>    <tr>       <th>Date </th>       <th>Stakeholder Consultation </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>16/02/2021 </td>       <td>Monitoring Committee of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>25/02/2021 </td>       <td>Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>25/02/2021 </td>       <td>The Irish Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises Association (ISME) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01/03/2021 </td>       <td>Chambers Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>04/03/2021 </td>       <td>Ibec </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11/03/2021 </td>       <td>Strategy Committee of the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Over time a blended model of learning has become the dominant mode with varying levels of onsite and online delivery aligned to public health advice and to the needs of different disciplines and different learner cohorts.</p>  <p>  Level 5 measures designate higher and further education as essential insofar as onsite presence is required for education and training activities that cannot be held remotely.  In January 2021, the sector rapidly adjusted again to the prevailing public health situation by moving the vast majority of their provision online.  </p>  <p>  The priority activities which can continue on-site, subject to the appropriate protective measures, guidelines and local assessment include practical tuition, workshops and skills-based learning (including in relation to apprenticeships) and engagement with vulnerable learners.  Institutions and providers will use their existing discretion, taking account of the public health situation nationally and locally to ensure that only the most essential work is taking place onsite. Local assessment will focus on activities that are not capable of being delivered through alternative means, and are time-critical for students and learners during this period. Reflecting the scale and diversity of third-level provision, further and higher education institutions are best equipped to determine where onsite presence is required.</p></reply>

From September 2021 the postgraduate fee grant will increase to &euro;3,500 from &euro;2,000. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and would give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. In addition the fee income threshold will increase to &euro;54,240 from &euro;31,500 from September 2021.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations for the 2021/22 academic year will be published towards the end of March/early April 2021. The opening of SUSI's online grant application system will coincide with the publication of the scheme. Grant applications are submitted online via www.susi.ie.

The Programme for Government reflects the importance of supporting learners at risk of education disadvantage and learners with special education needs in higher education.</p>  <p>  The vision of National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 is that the student body entering, participating in, and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. The plan set out five goals and more than thirty actions, developed following widespread consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups.  Those groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first-time mature students, students with disabilities, part-time/flexible learners, further education and training award holders; and Irish Travellers. The plan also indicated subgroups that require support, including lone parents, teen parents and ethnic minorities. Improving equity of access to higher education is an ongoing objective. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to the continued the roll-out of supports for students and targeted initiatives to support delivery of the vision and targets within the National Access Plan.  </p>  <p>  The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  </p>  <p>  Apart from the student grant and dedicated access supports it is important to note the range of additional supports which have been put in place for students as part of Budget 2021 and as part of the Government's COVID response earlier this year.  </p>  <p>  - The level of funding available in the Student Assistance Fund for 2020 was doubled;</p>  <p>  - &euro;1.9m in the form of a once-off COVID-19 contingency fund to enable HEIs deliver local COVID-19 responses to support disadvantaged students;</p>  <p>  - The level of funding for the 1916 Bursary Fund (also known as PATH 2) increased to &euro;5 million per annum, which will provide an additional 200 bursaries, bringing the total number for 2021 to 1,000 bursaries for the most disadvantaged students in the country;   - An additional &euro;20 million in funding for SUSI in 2021to cover increased applications to the scheme;</p>  <p>  - &euro;6 million allocated to enhance SUSI support for postgraduates;</p>  <p>  - &euro;15 million scheme to support access to laptops and digital devices;</p>  <p>  - &euro;50 million to provide financial assistance to full time third level students in recognition of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on this group. This funding will offer financial assistance to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions (HEI).  </p>  <p>  - &euro;300,000 has been secured through the Dormant Accounts Fund for targeted supports to address the implications of COVID-19 on Traveller participation in higher education.</p>  <p>   The objectives of the National Access Plan are supported by a range of interventions and programmes:</p>  <p>  - Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) which comprises dedicated funding to support access to higher education and consists of three strands focussed on increasing the participation of under-represented groups in higher education. The PATH fund has a current investment envelope of &euro;40.4 million over the period 2016 to 2022, across the three strands which are currently supporting access to initial teacher education, enables the award of bursaries of &euro;5,000 per academic year to 1,200 (200 per year) of the most socio economically disadvantaged students and through the Higher Education Access Fund is supporting institutional capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies for increasing access to higher education </p>  <p>  - Student Assistance Fund - annual funding of &euro;9.1m including ring-fenced funding &euro;1m for part-time students. In recent years, ring-fenced funding has also been provided for students on Professional Master of Education (PME) courses. </p>  <p>  - Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) &ndash; &euro;9.6m in funding every year covering both higher and further education sectors. The purpose of the Fund for Students with Disabilities is to provide funding to higher and further education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. Since 2018 the fund covers part-time students.</p>  <p>  - A study commissioned by the Higher Education Authority on the challenges facing mature students in participating in higher education is nearing completion and will be considered in the context of the new National Access Plan commencing in 2022. </p>  <p>  - The Action Plan for Increasing Traveller Participation in Higher Education 2019-2021 was launched in 2019 and its aim is to advance Traveller participation in higher education within the context of approaches on retention and transition of Travellers across the education spectrum.</p>  <p>  - Persons in the protection process (asylum and subsidiary protection) or leave to remain process are not eligible to access the statutory based SUSI grant scheme. However, the administratively based Student Support Scheme provides supports along similar lines to the SUSI grant scheme and is available to persons in the asylum, subsidiary protection or leave to remain process.  </p>  <p>  As part of the System Performance Framework 2018-2020, HEIs are required to put in place whole-of-institution Student Success Strategies to address the issue of non-completion of programmes, particularly for those in under-represented target groups.   It was hoped to have this in place by the end of 2020 but due to the COVID 19 restrictions this important work will run into 2021.</p>  <p>  A new National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education will be developed in 2021 for the years 2022-2026. Consultations on the approach to the development of the Plan has commenced. </p>  <p>  Science Foundations Ireland's Education and Public Engagement programme seeks to promote the awareness and engagement of the Irish public with science, technology, engineering and maths.   This work supports the growth in confidence of the Irish public to be informed and reflective on societal challenges we face together. Creativity, talent, the ability to innovate and to understand science will be required to ensure citizens can fully participate in our society and economy, both now and in the future. The research agencies under my Department overarching aim across all their work is to contribute to the betterment of society and to help foster an engaged and informed public that values research. </p></reply>

Tackling crime in our communities is a priority for this Government and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The new Programme for Government, <i>Our Shared Future</i>, recognises the fear and insecurity caused by anti-social behaviour and commits to tackling this through more visible community policing.</p><p>I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that local Garda management responsible for the policing of Grand Canal Dock report no increase in Public Order offences, Assaults, Criminal Damage, or related offences in the area, and that the vast amount of complaints from the area stem from people congregating, loitering and consuming alcohol. </p><p>I am advised that Garda&iacute; met with the local community and the Docklands Business Forum, in December 2020 and February 2021 respectively, to discuss the issues affecting the area.

This operation is run daily from June to September, its objective being to minimise the anti-social behaviour/disruption caused by young people swimming in the canal during the summer holiday period.  I understand that this operation has been positively received by the local community and it is envisioned that this operation will be run again in the coming summer months.  </p><p>More generally, the Deputy will be aware that the issue of youth crime is addressed in the new Youth Justice Strategy, covering the period from now to 2026, which I intend to finalise and bring to Government shortly.  This will consider the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system. This will include early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.  </p><p>I have also established a special expert forum on antisocial behaviour, which will consider the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.</p></reply>

The HSE will also undertake a full review the number of intern posts in a planned and targeted manner for July 2022 to ensure any increases in intern posts is aligned with projected workforce planning requirements, postgraduate training positions, the overall objective of delivering high quality training programmes and having appropriate focused career development opportunities to build the medical workforce and continue to deliver safe care. </p><p>As we are coming out of the third wave of COVID and facing increased waiting lists and other challenges there is a focus is on continued recruitment to ensure we have senior doctors to deal with the continued demands.

The recent Report of the Clinical Advisory Group, which was re-established by the HSE to carry out a review of eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness, recommended inter alia, that legislative change would be necessary to underpin an extension to the current prognosis timeframe required for 'End of Life' medical cards. My Department is therefore currently undertaking an examination of potential options for a legislative framework.</p>  <p>  However, pending the development of legislative options, I am pleased to confirm that the Government recently agreed to introduce an administrative arrangement for up to 12 months on an interim basis, that will enable persons who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having a prognosis of 24 months or less, to be awarded a medical card. These applications will not require a means assessment nor will they be reassessed. My Department has been actively engaging with the HSE's National Medical Card Unit to ensure all necessary processes and communications to operationalise the scheme are in place very shortly.</p>  <p>  In relation to the current processing times of applications, it should be noted that the HSE has a system in place for the efficient provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent ongoing medical care and also for persons receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. In these cases, a medical card is issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and completed medical report by a healthcare professional.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-11a.582.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021031100073#WRL01000"><p>The impact of COVID-19 on society in general and especially those living in nursing homes has been considerable and this remains a very difficult time for nursing home residents and their families.  The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be overstated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On 19th November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. </p>  <p>  Data indicates that 104 nursing homes are actively dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak. Noting that on 6th March approximately 525 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported, the level of risk, including to residents of nursing homes remains high. The public health advice remains clear, as noted in the statement from the National Public Health Emergency Team on 24th February &ldquo;Given the increased transmissibility of the virus now, we must continue to limit our social contacts and do all we can to starve this disease of opportunities to spread&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  </p>  <p>  I recently wrote to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the importance of adopting a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the important role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing. The importance of ensuring that visits take place to the greatest extent possible, in line with public health guidance and risk assessments was reiterated and providers were encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead, published on 23rd February, recognises that the challenge of balancing protective health measures and normal living has been particularly important in the context of visitations to long-term residential care settings (LTRC). LTRC visiting guidance has remained under ongoing review throughout the pandemic.  In light of the advanced stage of rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in LTRCs for both residents and staff, the NPHET (the National Public Health Emergency Team) requested that the HSE progress a process for considering the scope and application of LTRC visiting restrictions in the context of the Framework of Restrictive Measures, having regard to international and national evidence, the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and the level of disease in the community.  The HSE has drafted new visiting guidance, which will be considered by the NPHET today, 11th March. </p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>In addition the National Treatment Purchas Fund (NTPF) is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals , funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo; see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics, and clinical validation.</p><p>Budget 2021 provided an additional &euro;240 million for an Access to Care Fund, &euro;210 of which will be allocated to the HSE and &euro;30 million to the National treatment Purchase Fund. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of Covid-19, as well as to address waiting lists.</p><p>The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of patients on inpatient &amp;amp; daycase (IPDC) and outpatient waiting lists by county, is outlined in the attached document. <table>    <tr>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>OP Waiters by County as of 28/01/2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>Amount</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>9315</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>9161</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>16311</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>57010</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>23846</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>141380</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>41153</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>17783</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>28673</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>9687</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>13444</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>3759</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>31924</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>7235</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>15002</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

These services are provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. </p>  <p>  I met with representatives of the dental profession towards the end of last year when I had an opportunity to hear first-hand the challenges which they face under Covid, and the enormous efforts of their members in continuing to provide services in the current environment. I accept that the profession has concerns about the current contract, which dates back to the nineties, and that one of those concerns relates to the fee structure under the DTSS.</p>  <p>  I want to ensure the sustainability and viability of that contract and that all eligible persons can continue to receive the services that they deserve from their local dentists.  In that respect, I have asked my officials and the HSE to bring forward proposals to address the immediate concerns of the dental community.  In the longer term, my commitment to the profession and to the public is for a fundamental review of the contract, in keeping with Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy. </p></reply>

While every effort is made to avoid cancellation or postponement of planned procedures, the HSE has advised that planned procedures and operations can be postponed or cancelled for a variety of reasons including capacity issues due to increased scheduled and unscheduled care demand.</p>  <p>  On 2nd January 2021, the HSE issued correspondence to the Acute hospital system advising of the need to curtail scheduled elective care. This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and the projected trend in admissions based upon community transmission levels of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently recommending that only critical time dependent elective procedures are undertaken at this time due to the on-going and significant increased demand for bed capacity related to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of Covid-19, as well as to address waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. </p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.</p></reply>

Owing to the well-acknowledged positive impact of IMGTI, plans are currently underway to develop and expand the number of specialties and source countries participating on these programmes, to increase further the number of doctors in training. This programme provides a structured route for non-EEA doctors to gain access to clinical experience and training in Ireland. </p>  <p>  For those NCHDs who hold an NCHD contract with the HSE, and are not enrolled in a postgraduate training programme, the HSE has put in place a number of provisions to support their professional development such as: </p>  <p>  - Continuous Professional Development Support Scheme  </p>  <p>  The continuous professional development support scheme (CPD&ndash;SS) is funded by the HSE to facilitate NCHDs, who are not in training posts, to continue to maintain and enhance their clinical knowledge and skills, and also to maintain their professional competence in line with Medical Council requirements. Under this scheme, eligible NCHDs are able to undertake training and educational activities of up to 20 external credits or three days per annum, whichever is greatest. NCHDs who register for this scheme are provided free access to a range of clinical courses/activities provided by all Irish medical training bodies.  The HSE is committed to enhancing the educational offering for NCHDs not presently enrolled in a postgraduate training programme, and are currently working with postgraduate training bodies to explore further developments which can be offered under this scheme. </p>  <p>  - Training Support Scheme (TSS) </p>  <p>  The Training Support Scheme (TSS), introduced in July 2019, provides a fund of up to &euro;1,250 per annum, allowing an NCHD to apply for reimbursement for approved exams, courses, or conferences.  This scheme is open to all NCHDs. </p>  <p>  - Clinical Course Exam Refund Scheme (CCERS) </p>  <p>  The Clinical Course Exam Refund Scheme provides funding towards an approved list of clinical courses and exams, such as membership/fellowships examinations, and Advanced Cardiac Life Suppport (ACLS).  Since July 2019, the full costs of approved examination/courses are eligible for refund to NCHDs under the Clinical Course Exam Refund Scheme (CCERS) &ndash; this was previously capped at &euro;450. </p>  <p>  Claims under both the CCERS and TSS can now be made easily via an NCHD&rsquo;s National Employment Record, which allows NCHDs to submit claims online, and provides complete transparency in terms of claims they may have made, and the balance of funds remaining. </p>  <p>  - E-portfolio </p>  <p>  National Doctors Training and Planning Unit in the HSE has commenced the development of an E-Portfolio/Logbook accessible to NCHDs via their National Employment Record.  </p>  <p>  The principal objective of the E-Portfolio is to allow NCHDs, who are not on a formal training scheme, access to a generic standard document in which they can record their training and career development. It will also give them the opportunity to have their experience validated by their supervising consultant, where applicable. All NCHDs will be able to access the E-Portfolio.  The E-Portfolio will be launched in the coming months. </p></reply>

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets should the relevant person remain in care for an extended period of many years.</p><p>Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. </p><p>This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between my officials and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. The Bill is on the priority list for the Spring legislative programme. </p><p>While developing the legislation, the Department of Health has considered that assets which have not been transferred more than five years before the owner requires nursing home care remain part of the financial assessment of means. The five-year period in respect of transferred assets has been a constant feature of the Scheme, to act as a means of protecting the Scheme, which is based on the means of those availing of it. The policy intent of the proposed Amendment is to facilitate the continued viability of family owned and operated farms and businesses by providing a degree of certainty on the cost of long term care by applying a cap on the contribution made against such an asset after three years in care. While it is not intended that the five year period in respect of transferred assets will be amended, it is intended that the 3-year cap would apply in such cases should a family successor be nominated by the relevant person.  </p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department and further information is available here: <i></i>.</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE.</p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>Vaccination of those aged 70 and older (in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74) began in February.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy.</p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.</p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Further details are available at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in direct patient contact roles will be vaccinated in Group 2. This includes HCWs working in public, private, and voluntary settings. Other HCWs, not in direct patient contact, will now be vaccinated in Group 6.</p></reply>

The vision of Sl&aacute;intecare is to achieve a universal single-tier health and social care system, where everyone has equitable access to services based on need, and not ability to pay. Over time, citizens will have entitlement to a comprehensive range of primary, acute and social care services. The aim is to deliver a universal health service that offers the right care, in the right place, at the right time, at low or no cost.</p><p>Following the publication of the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare Report in 2017, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy was agreed by Government in August 2018, setting out an initial set of key actions for a three-year period.

the establishment of joint GP Forum;  the establishment of the Staff Engagement Forum and Integration Fund Learning Network; Engagement with Community Voluntary Network and Dialogue Forum on Voluntary Bodies;

Under its Border Operating Model (BOM), the UK is progressively introducing new checks and controls on its trade with the EU on 1st January, 1st April and 1st July.</p>  <p>  This requirement places new additional demands on industry and the State. My Department has examined data, including conducting surveys with industry on likely certification requirements. The actual number of veterinary health certificates and other certificates that will be needed from 1st April depends very much on exporters' business practice in response to UK import requirements and wider considerations. For example, business decisions on consolidation of consignments in Ireland and distribution in Great Britain, decisions regarding the continued use of the landbridge for consignments destined for the EU continental market as well as trade impacts arising post-Covid lockdown will all impact on likely certification requirements from 1st April.</p>  <p>  Good progress is being made in the implementation of the key elements of my Department's work plan to meet UK import requirements on 1st April. Detailed business processes have been prepared, work on IT systems is on track, and the necessary staffing and training is being put in place to deliver on the certification requirements (this will involve contracted services, some additional recruitment of staff and the temporary reassignment of existing staff). On communications, officials in my Department will continue to engage intensively with industry over the coming weeks to ensure that these systems are in place to provide export health certification on the scale required.</p>  <p>  I would urge all exporters to avail of the range of Government supports that are available, including training and grants. Further information on these and other supports is set out at Gov.ie/Brexit.</p></reply>

The ecologists are part of the overall licencing team which also includes archaeologists and forestry inspectors and administrative staff. The targets set for this team collectively are the overall licencing targets for the Department which are 4,500 new licences this year.</p><p>The Department signed a one year contract on the 17<sup>th</sup>June 2020 with an option to extend for a further two years. Under this contract, five full time ecologists were made available to the Department. In the event that this contract runs for three years, the total potential cost of the contract would be &euro;1.5m, based on a per diem rate for each ecologist.</p><p>Further contracts were signed on 12<sup>th</sup>February 2021 in relation to five independent ecologists with each contract expiring on the 31st December 2021 with no option to extend.  These contracts did not stipulate the provision of full-time services and, therefore, it is difficult to calculate the full cost of these contracts over their duration. However, the average daily rate is &euro;330 and it is expected that some 600 days will be provided by these independent ecologists for the duration of their contracts. Therefore, the estimated costs is in the region of &euro;200,000.</p></reply>

It is for this reason my Department will be focusing on afforestation applications in the coming weeks. I am mindful of the seasonality associated with afforestation and, therefore, while other forestry licence types will continue to issue, afforestation will be the priority.</p>  <p>Forestry licences continue to be received and issued daily. To 5th March, the area covered by issued afforestation licences was 903ha. There are currently 1,500 applications within my Department&rsquo;s system, covering 9,600ha, which are at various stages of processing, from the initial application steps, to ready for decision.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is another 4,500ha already approved and available to plant. It is up to landowners to decide to plant, once they have received approval to do so, but I would encourage anyone that has approval to arrange financial approval, which is a straightforward process completed by their registered forester and to commence planting.</p>  <p>  I recently announced Project Woodland on foot of receiving the Jo O'Hara report and I have moved immediately to implement this. I am confident that the changes presented in there to processes both within my Department and the independent Forestry Appeals Committee, will bear fruit, particularly to give confidence to applicants and potential applicants, that they can receive a timely decision on their afforestation application.</p></reply>

I am informed that that there are currently 82 licence appeal applications on hand in respect of the afforestation category representing 930 hectares. Three of these have been heard and are awaiting a decision and 23 are scheduled to be heard by 15th April, 2021.</p>  <p>  The FAC hear both oral and non-oral hearing appeals and are currently hearing appeals remotely due to COVID-19 restrictions. The FAC is hearing on average 20 cases per week whereas they were hearing eight per week before the introduction of three new committees in November 2020 New appeals continue to be submitted with 74 received since the introduction of the Forestry legislation. The FAC currently has 298 cases on hand, of which 101 are scheduled for hearing, 46 are already heard and a decision is awaited the final 151 have yet to be scheduled.</p>  <p>  It is extremely important that applicants and their forestry companies notify the FAC in advance on appeals which are scheduled so that appeals are only heard on licences which are genuinely going to proceed if granted.</p></reply>
